Most aneurysms do not cause any problems, but they can be serious because there's a risk they could burst (rupture). Symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysm often has no symptoms. You usually only find out you have one during an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening test or during tests for another condition. If an aneurysm gets bigger, you might sometimes notice: tummy or back pain a pulsing feeling in your tummy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have tummy or back pain that does not go away or keeps coming back you feel a lump in your tummy These symptoms can be caused by lots of things and do not mean you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, but it's best to get them checked. Immediate action required: Call 999 if you or someone else: have sudden, severe pain in your tummy or back are struggling to breathe or have stopped breathing have pale or grey skin (on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet) lose consciousness These could be signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm bursting (rupturing). This is a life-threatening emergency that needs to be treated in hospital as soon as possible. Tests for abdominal aortic aneurysm The main test to find out if you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm is an ultrasound scan of your tummy. A small device is placed on your tummy and images of the inside of your tummy will be shown on a screen. You'll usually be told if you have an aneurysm at the end of the test. You’ll also be told how big it is: small (3cm to 4.4cm or smaller) medium (4.5cm to 5.4cm) large (5.5cm or bigger) Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm An ultrasound test is offered to all men when they turn 65, as they're most at risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is called abdominal aortic aneurysm screening . Treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm usually depends on how big it is and if you have symptoms. If it's small, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating healthily may be recommended to help stop it getting bigger. Sometimes you may need: medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol level, which may help stop the aneurysm getting bigger surgery to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting - this may be done if your AAA is large (5.5cm or bigger), is quickly getting bigger or is painful Surgery has risks and side effects which your doctor or surgeon should discuss with you. Abdominal aortic aneurysms often get bigger over time. You'll usually need regular scans to see if it's getting bigger. If your aneurysm ruptures, you’ll need emergency surgery to treat it.

Credit: ANDRE LABBE, ISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/886025/view The patches often appear gradually without any other symptoms. Sometimes the skin may be itchy. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have new dark patches on your skin you have any skin changes you're unsure about What happens at your appointment A GP can usually tell if it's acanthosis nigricans by looking at your skin. Although acanthosis nigricans is usually harmless, it's best to get any skin changes checked out. Rarely, it can be a sign of something more serious, such as cancer. You may need some tests to find out what's causing the patches. Causes of acanthosis nigricans The most common cause of acanthosis nigricans is obesity . Other causes include: type 2 diabetes conditions that affect hormone levels – such as Cushing's syndrome , polycystic ovary syndrome or an underactive thyroid taking certain medicines – including steroids or hormone treatments like the contraceptive pill rarely, cancer – usually stomach cancer rarely, a faulty gene inherited from your parents Sometimes healthy people with no other conditions get acanthosis nigricans. This is more common in people with black or brown skin. Treating acanthosis nigricans Once a GP knows what's causing acanthosis nigricans, they can recommend the best treatment. The patches should fade over time once the cause is treated. If you're very overweight, a GP may recommend losing weight. Depending on the cause, they may also recommend: medicine to balance your hormones medicine to balance your insulin levels changing your medicine to one that does not cause the patches There's no specific treatment for the patches themselves. A skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance, but finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first.

    "title": "Achalasia",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/achalasia/",
    "text": "Achalasia Achalasia is a rare disorder of the food pipe (oesophagus), which can make it difficult to swallow food and drink. Normally, the muscles of the oesophagus contract to squeeze food along towards the stomach. A ring of muscle at the end of the food pipe then relaxes to let food into the stomach. In achalasia, the muscles in the oesophagus do not contract correctly and the ring of muscle can fail to open properly, or does not open at all. Food and drink cannot pass into the stomach and becomes stuck. It is often brought back up. Symptoms of achalasia Not everyone with achalasia will have symptoms. But most people with achalasia will find it difficult to swallow food or drink (known as dysphagia ). Swallowing tends to get gradually more difficult or painful over a couple of years, to the point where it is sometimes impossible. Other symptoms include: bringing back up undigested food choking and coughing fits heartburn chest pain repeated chest infections drooling of vomit or saliva gradual but significant weight loss Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life. Swallowing problems can also be caused by cancers of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. There’s a link between long-term achalasia and the risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus , but the risk is small. It’s always important to get symptoms checked straight away, even if your symptoms are not bothering you. Causes of achalasia Achalasia is thought to happen when the nerves in the oesophagus become damaged and stop working properly, which is why the muscles and ring of muscle do not work. The exact cause of this is unknown. In some people, it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs. In rare cases, it's possible that achalasia is caused by a faulty gene. Diagnosing achalasia If a GP thinks you have achalasia, you'll be referred to hospital to have some diagnostic tests. Achalasia may also be diagnosed during an investigation, such as a chest X-ray , for another reason. The tests for achalasia include: manometry – a small plastic tube is passed through your mouth or nose into your oesophagus to measure the muscle pressure along it at different points. barium swallow – you drink a white liquid containing the chemical barium and X-rays are taken. The barium shows up clearly on X-ray so the doctor can see how long it takes to move into your stomach. endoscopy – a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your oesophagus, the ring of muscle and your stomach. Treatments for achalasia There is no cure for achalasia, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier. Your doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options. Medicine Medicines, such as nitrates or nifedipine , can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus. This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although they do not work for everyone. The effect only lasts for a short time, so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches, but this usually improves over time. Stretching the muscle (balloon dilation) Under a sedative, or sometimes a general anaesthetic , a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube ( endoscope ). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach. This improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve. Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery. Botox injection Using an endoscope, botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax. It is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments. Surgery Under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery ( laparoscopy ) and is called Heller's myotomy. It can permanently make swallowing easier. Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting acid reflux and heartburn , which can be a side effect of the Heller's myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this and any other surgical options which may be the best option for you. Follow-up treatment Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. A GP may be able to prescribe medicine to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medicine routinely. It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment. You should see a GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight after treatment.

    "text": "Reflux in babies Reflux is when a baby brings up milk, or is sick, during or shortly after feeding. It's very common and usually gets better on its own. Symptoms of reflux in babies Reflux usually starts before a baby is 8 weeks old and gets better by the time they're 1. Symptoms of reflux in babies include: bringing up milk or being sick during or shortly after feeding coughing or hiccupping when feeding being unsettled during feeding swallowing or gulping after burping or feeding crying and not settling not gaining weight as they're not keeping enough food down Sometimes babies may have signs of reflux but will not bring up milk or be sick. This is known as silent reflux. Things you can try to ease reflux in babies It's common for a baby under the age of 1 to bring up a little bit of milk during or shortly after a feed, without being distressed. Your baby does not usually need to see a doctor if they have reflux, as long as they're happy, healthy and gaining weight. If symptoms of reflux seem to be bothering your baby, there are things you can do to help. Do ask a health visitor for advice and support get advice about your baby's breastfeeding position or how to bottle feed your baby hold your baby upright during feeding and for as long as possible after feeding burp your baby regularly during feeds make sure your baby sleeps flat on their back (they should not sleep on their side or front) Don’t do not raise the head of their cot or Moses basket Non-urgent advice: See a GP if your baby: is not improving after trying things to ease reflux gets reflux for the first time after they're 6 months old is older than 1 and still has reflux is not gaining weight or is losing weight Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if your baby: has vomit that's green or yellow, or has blood in it is projectile vomiting (being sick with more force than usual) has blood in their poo has a swollen or tender tummy has a very high temperature or they feel hot or shivery keeps being sick and cannot keep fluid down has diarrhoea that lasts for over a week or has signs of dehydration will not stop crying and is very distressed is refusing to feed Also call your GP or 111 if you have any other concerns about your baby. Treatment for reflux in babies A GP or specialist may want to check whether your baby has an allergy to cow's milk, because the symptoms can be very similar to reflux. If there's no sign of cow' milk allergy, they may recommend treatments for reflux. If your baby is formula-fed, they may recommend: a powder that's mixed with formula, to thicken it a pre-thickened formula milk If the thickening powder does not help or your baby is breastfed, a GP or specialist might recommend medicines that help with distress from reflux and stop their stomach from producing as much acid. Very rarely, surgery might be needed to strengthen the muscle that stops food or milk travelling back up. This is usually only after trying other things or if their reflux is severe. Causes of reflux Reflux usually happens because the ring of muscle inside your baby's food pipe (oesophagus) can be weak, which allows milk to come back up easily. This muscle will get stronger as your baby gets older and the reflux should stop. Page last reviewed: 10 June 2025 Next review due: 10 June 2028"

    "text": "Overview - Acne Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch. Symptoms of acne Acne most commonly develops on the: face – this affects almost everyone with acne back – this affects more than half of people with acne chest – this affects about 15% of people with acne Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/250116/view Types of spots There are 6 main types of spot caused by acne: blackheads – small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces colour whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and will not empty when squeezed papules – small red bumps that may feel tender or sore pustules – similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus nodules – large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful cysts – the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring Things you can try if you have acne These self-help techniques may be useful: Do not wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse. Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse. Do not try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring . Avoid make-up, skincare and suncare products that are oil-based (sometimes labelled “comedogenic”). Use water-based non-comedogenic products, as they’re less likely to block the pores in your skin. Completely remove make-up before going to bed. If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free water-based emollient . Regular exercise cannot improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising as sweat can irritate your acne. Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face. Although acne cannot be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. If you develop mild acne , it's a good idea to speak to a pharmacist for advice. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available to buy from pharmacies. Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended, but be careful as this can bleach clothing. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription. When to seek medical advice If you have mild acne , speak to a pharmacist about medicines to treat it. If these do not control your acne, or it's making you feel very unhappy, see a GP. You should see a GP if you have moderate or severe acne or you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring. Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring. Treatments can take several months to work, so do not expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good. Why do I have acne? Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage. Other possible causes Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women. There's no evidence that poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne. Who's affected? Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 95% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne to some extent. Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19. Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-20s. In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 3% of adults have acne over the age of 35. Page last reviewed: 03 January 2023 Next review due: 03 January 2026 Next : Causes"

    "title": "Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acoustic-neuroma/",
    "text": "Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous (benign) brain tumour. It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma. A benign brain tumour is a growth in the brain that usually grows slowly over many years and does not spread to other parts of the body. Acoustic neuromas grow on the nerve used for hearing and balance, which can cause problems such as hearing loss and unsteadiness. They can sometimes be serious if they become very large, but most are picked up and treated before they reach this stage. Acoustic neuromas tend to affect adults aged 30 to 60 and usually have no obvious cause, although a small number of cases are the result of a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) . Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma An acoustic neuroma may not cause any obvious symptoms at first. Any symptoms tend to develop gradually and often include: hearing loss that usually only affects 1 ear hearing sounds that come from inside the body ( tinnitus ) the sensation that you're moving or spinning ( vertigo ) A large acoustic neuroma can also sometimes cause: persistent headaches temporary blurred or double vision numbness, pain or weakness on 1 side of the face problems with limb co-ordination ( ataxia ) on 1 side of the body voice changes or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Getting medical advice See your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you're worried could be caused by an acoustic neuroma. Acoustic neuromas can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as Ménière's disease . If your GP thinks you could have an acoustic neuroma, you'll be referred to a hospital or clinic for further tests, such as: hearing tests to check for hearing problems and determine whether they're caused by a problem with your nerves an MRI scan , which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your head a CT scan , which uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of the inside of your head Treatments for acoustic neuromas There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health. The main options are: monitoring the tumour – small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, and treatment is generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger brain surgery – surgery to remove all or some of the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger stereotactic radiosurgery – small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger All these options carry some risks. For example, surgery and radiosurgery can sometimes cause facial numbness or an inability to move part of your face ( paralysis ). Speak to your specialist about the best option for you and what the benefits and risks are. Outlook for acoustic neuromas Large acoustic neuromas can be serious because they can sometimes cause a life-threatening build-up of fluid in the brain ( hydrocephalus ). But it's rare for them to reach this stage. Many grow very slowly or not at all, and those that grow more quickly can be treated before they become too big. Even with treatment, symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and affect your ability to work, communicate and drive. These problems may need additional treatment. Read more about treating hearing loss and treating tinnitus . An acoustic neuroma can occasionally return after treatment. This is thought to happen to around 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal. You'll probably continue having regular MRI scans after any treatment to check if the tumour is growing again or coming back. Page last reviewed: 29 November 2022 Next review due: 29 November 2025"

Symptoms of acromegaly Symptoms of acromegaly can develop slowly. They may include: swollen hands and feet tiredness or difficulty sleeping sleep apnoea sweating numbness and weakness in your hands abnormal height growth in children and teenagers (gigantism) body growth – feet, fingers, head, tongue and neck may increase in size headaches joint pain thicker, more oily skin a deeper voice irregular periods erection problems You usually get acromegaly between the ages of 30 and 50 years old, but you can get symptoms at any age. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you may have acromegaly Early diagnosis and treatment can stop symptoms getting worse. Causes of acromegaly Acromegaly is usually caused by an adenoma (a non-cancerous tumour ) in the pituitary gland. This is a pea-sized gland at the back of your brain. An adenoma can cause you to produce too much growth hormone. Acromegaly is not usually passed on from your parents (inherited). What happens at your appointment Acromegaly may take time to be diagnosed. If the GP thinks you have it, they may ask to see photographs of you from the past couple of years to check any changes. They may also refer you to a specialist for tests, including: blood tests an MRI scan of your brain to see if you have a tumour Treatments for acromegaly Treatments for acromegaly can include: surgery to remove the tumour radiotherapy to target the tumour and reduce growth hormone levels injections or tablets to reduce growth hormone levels Treatment usually stops your body producing too much growth hormone and usually improves your symptoms. After treatment, you'll continue to have appointments with a specialist. They can monitor how well your pituitary gland is working and check that your treatment is right for you. Complications of acromegaly Acromegaly can increase your risk of: type 2 diabetes high blood pressure (hypertension) heart disease bowel polyps You'll have regular health checks to monitor these conditions, including colonoscopy screenings to check for bowel polyps. Recording information about you and your condition If you have acromegaly, your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists find better ways to treat and prevent this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you notice new patches on your skin the patches begin to bleed, get bigger, change colour, feel tender or develop into a lump a patch appears on your lips It's important to get these skin changes checked in case they're being caused by something more serious, such as skin cancer. Treatment for actinic keratoses If you only have 1 actinic keratoses patch, a GP might suggest waiting to see if it goes away by itself. If you have more than 1 patch, or a patch is causing you problems such as pain and itchiness, treatment is usually recommended. A GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist). Treatments for actinic keratoses include: prescription creams and gels freezing the patches (cryotherapy) – this makes the patches turn into blisters and fall off after a few weeks surgery to cut out or scrape away the patches – you'll be given a local anaesthetic first, so it does not hurt photodynamic therapy (PDT), where special cream is applied to the patches and a light is shone on them Things you can do if you have actinic keratoses There are things you can do to stop your actinic keratoses patches getting worse and lower your chances of developing skin cancer. Do check your skin regularly for any changes use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 before going out in the sun and reapply regularly wear a hat and clothing that fully covers your arms and legs when you're out in the sun Don’t do not sunbathe do not use sunlamps or sunbeds as these can also damage your skin do not go into the sun between 11am and 3pm – this is when the sun is at its strongest Information: Consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if you always cover up outdoors.

    "text": "Actinomycosis Actinomycosis is a rare type of bacterial infection. It can be very serious but can usually be treated with antibiotics. How you get actinomycosis The bacteria that cause actinomycosis normally live harmlessly in the body. They only cause an infection if they get into the lining of areas such as the mouth or gut. You cannot spread the infection to other people. Any part of the body can be infected, but the head and neck, chest, tummy and pelvis are most commonly affected. Possible causes of actinomycosis include: tooth decay and mouth infections mouth injuries inhaling food or liquid intrauterine devices (IUDs) dental or tummy surgery radiotherapy You're more likely to get actinomycosis if you have type 2 diabetes or a weakened immune system. Symptoms of actinomycosis Symptoms of actinomycosis depend on what part of the body is affected. Actinomycosis symptoms in different areas of the body Area of the body Symptoms Jaw or mouth Lumps in your cheek or neck, difficulty chewing, pus leaking from your skin Lungs Shortness of breath, chest pain, a cough, pus leaking from the skin on your chest Tummy Diarrhoea or constipation, pain, a lump or swelling in your tummy, pus leaking from the skin on your tummy Pelvis Pain low down in your tummy, vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge, a lump or swelling in your lower tummy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of actinomycosis Treatment for actinomycosis Actinomycosis is treated with antibiotics. Treatment starts off in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously). When you're well enough to go home, you'll be given antibiotic tablets to take for a few months. It's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better. You might also need surgery to drain areas of pus (abscesses) and remove the surrounding area of skin if it's infected. How to prevent actinomycosis Actinomycosis is very rare, so the chances of getting it are extremely small. You can help reduce your risk by looking after your teeth and gums .

    "title": "Acute cholecystitis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-cholecystitis/",
    "text": "Acute cholecystitis Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. It usually happens when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. The cystic duct is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones are very common, affecting more than 1 in 10 adults in the UK. They do not usually cause symptoms, but can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious because of the risk of complications. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with rest, intravenous fluids and antibiotics . Symptoms of acute cholecystitis The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the tummy is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike other types of abdominal pain , the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and does not go away within a few hours. Some people may have additional symptoms, such as: a high temperature feeling sick being sick sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the tummy When to get medical advice See a GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a high temperature. If you're unable to contact a GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice. It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, as there's a risk of serious complications developing if it's not treated promptly. What causes acute cholecystitis? The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. Calculous cholecystitis Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. An inflamed gallbladder can sometimes become infected by bacteria. Acalculous cholecystitis Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It's less common, but usually more serious, than calculous cholecystitis. The exact cause of acalculous cholecystitis is not known, but it's usually a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. A combination of risk factors may lead to acalculous cholecystitis, including accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns , sepsis , severe malnutrition or dehydration . Diagnosing acute cholecystitis If you have severe tummy pain, a GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with the GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand. If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests – to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your tummy – to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Treating acute cholecystitis If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Initial treatment Initial treatment will usually involve: not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medicine to relieve your pain You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home. Surgery Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis coming back and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy . There are 2 main types of cholecystectomy: open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy laparoscopic cholecystectomy – keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often recommended within 1 week of confirming acute cholecystitis. Some people who have had their gallbladder removed have symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, but it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Find out more about recovering from gallbladder removal Alternatives to surgery Sometimes surgery may not be an option – for example, if you have another condition that makes surgery unsuitable. If surgery is not an option, you may be offered a procedure to drain away the fluid that has collected in your gallbladder. A narrow tube is inserted into the gallbladder to make an opening for the fluid to drain. This can be done through a cut made in the skin of your tummy, or using an endoscopic procedure (through your mouth and into the stomach). Possible complications Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) – which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) – which can spread the infection within your tummy (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about 2 or 3 in every 10 cases of acute cholecystitis. Preventing acute cholecystitis It's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones. One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Living with overweight or obesity also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly . But low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best. Find out more about preventing gallstones The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. It's an organ that's useful, but not essential, and it can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.

    "text": "Acute kidney injury Acute kidney injury (AKI) is where your kidneys suddenly stop working properly. It can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure. AKI normally happens as a complication of another serious illness. It's not the result of a physical blow to the kidneys, as the name might suggest. This type of kidney damage is usually seen in older people who are unwell with other conditions and the kidneys are also affected. It's essential that AKI is detected early and treated promptly. Without quick treatment, abnormal levels of salts and chemicals can build up in the body, which affects the ability of other organs to work properly. If the kidneys shut down completely, this may require temporary support from a dialysis machine, or lead to death. AKI can also affect children and young people. Find out more from infoKID about AKI in children Symptoms of acute kidney injury Symptoms of AKI include: feeling sick or being sick diarrhoea dehydration peeing less than usual confusion drowsiness Even if it does not progress to complete kidney failure, AKI needs to be taken seriously. It has an effect on the whole body, changes how some medicines are handled by the body, and could make some existing illnesses more serious. AKI is different from chronic kidney disease , where the kidneys gradually lose function over a long period of time. Who's at risk of acute kidney injury? You're more likely to get AKI if: you're aged 65 or over you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease you have a long-term disease, such as heart failure , liver disease or diabetes you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this) you have a severe infection or sepsis you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) , such as ibuprofen, or blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body, but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness you're given aminoglycosides – a type of antibiotic that's usually only given in hospital; these medicines are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill Causes of acute kidney injury Most cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who's already unwell with another health condition. This reduced blood flow could be caused by: low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhoea, or severe dehydration the heart pumping out less blood than normal as a result of heart failure , liver failure or sepsis certain medicines that reduce blood pressure or blood flow to the kidneys, such as ACE inhibitors, certain diuretics or NSAIDs AKI can also be caused by a problem with the kidney itself, such as inflammation of the filters in the kidney ( glomerulonephritis ), the blood vessels ( vasculitis ), or other structures in the kidney. This may be caused by a reaction to some medicines, infections or the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays. It may sometimes be the result of a blockage affecting the drainage of the kidneys, such as: an enlarged prostate a tumour in the pelvis, such as an ovarian or bladder tumour kidney stones Diagnosing acute kidney injury A doctor may suspect AKI if you: are in an \"at risk\" group and suddenly fall ill get symptoms of AKI AKI is usually diagnosed with a blood test to measure your levels of creatinine, a chemical waste product produced by the muscles. If there's a lot of creatinine in your blood, it means your kidneys are not working as well as they should. You may also be asked to give a pee sample. Find out more from InfoKID about AKI in children Investigating the underlying cause Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause. Doctors also need to know about: any other symptoms, such as signs of sepsis or signs of heart failure any other medical conditions any medicine that's been taken in the past week, as some medicines can cause AKI An ultrasound scan should reveal if the cause is a blockage in the urinary system, such as an enlarged prostate or bladder tumour. Treating acute kidney injury Treatment of AKI depends on what's causing your illness and how severe it is. You may need: to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated antibiotics if you have an infection to stop taking certain medicines (at least until the problem is sorted) a urinary catheter, a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage You may need to go to hospital for some treatments. Most people with AKI make a full recovery, but some people go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure as a result. In severe cases, dialysis – where a machine filters the blood to rid the body of harmful waste, extra salt and water – may be needed. Preventing acute kidney injury Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medicine. It's also useful to check how much pee you're passing. Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little pee, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment. People who are dehydrated or at risk of dehydration may need to be given fluids through a drip. Any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily. Complications of acute kidney injury The most serious complications of acute kidney injury include: high levels of potassium in the blood – in severe cases, this can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and heart rhythm problems too much fluid in the body, which can cause build-up of fluid in the arms and legs ( oedema ) or in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) – which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness chronic kidney disease Page last reviewed: 08 September 2022 Next review due: 08 September 2025"

But some things can increase your risk of getting AML, including: previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous radiotherapy treatment) smoking and other exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke having a blood disorder or some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome Find out more about the causes of AML Who's affected AML is a rare type of cancer, with around 3,100 people diagnosed with it each year in the UK. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It's most common in people over 75. How AML is treated Treatment for AML needs to begin as soon as possible, as it can develop quickly. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant .

    "title": "Overview-Addison's disease",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/addisons-disease/",
    "text": "Overview - Addison's disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Addison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism, is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are 2 small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce 2 essential hormones: cortisol and aldosterone. The adrenal gland is damaged in Addison's disease, so it does not produce enough cortisol or aldosterone. About 9,000 people in the UK have Addison's disease, with over 300 new cases diagnosed each year. It can affect people of any age, although it's most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It's also more common in women than men. Symptoms of Addison's disease Early-stage symptoms of Addison's disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as clinical depression or flu . You may experience: lack of energy or motivation (fatigue) muscle weakness low mood loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss increased thirst Over time, these problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting , cramps and exhaustion. You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums. Although these symptoms are not always caused by Addison's disease, you should see a GP so they can be investigated. Why it happens Addison's disease is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of the steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the UK. Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis (TB) , although this is uncommon in the UK. Treating Addison's disease Addison's disease is treated with medicine to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take it for the rest of your life. With treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition have a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life with few limitations. But many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue, and there may be associated health conditions, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) . Adrenal crisis People with Addison's disease must be constantly aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly. An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison's disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, they will need a hydrocortisone injection immediately, either injected by themselves or by a person who is with them. Then call 999 for an ambulance, saying it's an \"adrenal crisis\" or \"Addisonian crisis\".

    "text": "Adenomyosis Adenomyosis is a condition where the lining of the womb (uterus) starts growing into the muscle in the wall of the womb. There are treatments that can help with any symptoms. Adenomyosis is more commonly diagnosed in women over the age of 30. It can affect anyone who has periods. Credit: Multimedia Team - nhs.uk Symptoms of adenomyosis Some symptoms of adenomyosis affect your periods, such as: painful periods – the pain may be severe and stop you from doing your usual activities heavy bleeding during your period Other symptoms can happen any time in your menstrual cycle, such as: pelvic pain (pain in the lower part of your tummy) bloating, heaviness or fullness in your tummy (abdomen) pain during sex Some people with adenomyosis have no symptoms. Information: Endometriosis is a different condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your pelvic pain or period pain is severe or worse than usual, and painkillers have not helped You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your periods become more painful, heavier or irregular you have pain during sex heavy periods are affecting your life or you've had them for some time you've been feeling bloated for a while (about 3 weeks) you bleed between periods or after sex What happens at your GP appointment The GP may ask about your periods if you have symptoms of adenomyosis. They may feel your tummy to see if there’s any swelling or bloating. You can ask for a female doctor when you book your appointment. The doctor might also ask to do an internal examination, to check your vagina and cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb). You can have a friend, family member or other member of staff in the room with you during your examination if you want. Sometimes further tests are needed to find out what’s causing your symptoms, or to rule out similar conditions such as endometriosis. Tests may include: ultrasound scan MRI scan Treatments for adenomyosis If you’re diagnosed with adenomyosis, there are treatments that can help ease your symptoms. Treatments include: the IUS (intrauterine system, also called Mirena or hormonal coil), which thins the womb lining, making your periods lighter and less painful other types of hormonal contraception if you cannot or do not want to have an IUS, such as the progestogen-only pill , the combined pill or the contraceptive patch medicines such as tranexamic acid or NSAIDs If these treatments do not work, you may need surgery. This could be a hysterectomy , or surgery to remove the lining of your womb (endometrial ablation). How to ease symptoms of adenomyosis There are things that can help with period pain or pelvic pain caused by adenomyosis. Do use a heat pad or hot water bottle wrapped in a tea towel on your tummy try a TENS machine – a small device that uses mild electrical impulses to reduce pain take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen Who is more likely to get adenomyosis? It's not clear what causes adenomyosis. You may be more likely to get it if you are over the age of 30 and have given birth. Page last reviewed: 17 July 2023 Next review due: 17 July 2026"

    "text": "ADHD in adults ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a condition where the brain works differently to most people. If you have ADHD, you may have trouble with things like concentrating and sitting still. There are things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Information: ADHD in children and young people There is separate information about ADHD in children and young people . Symptoms of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) Symptoms of ADHD involve your ability to pay attention to things (being inattentive), having high energy levels (being hyperactive) and your ability to control your impulses (being impulsive). You may show signs of being inattentive, such as: being easily distracted or forgetful finding it hard to organise your time finding it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks losing things often, like your wallet, mobile or keys You may show signs of being hyperactive and impulsive, including: having a lot of energy or feeling restless being very talkative or interrupting conversations making quick decisions without thinking about what might happen as a result Most people with ADHD will have symptoms of both the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive type. Some only show signs of one type. These symptoms usually start before the age of 12. ADHD is thought to be recognised less often in women than men. This may be because women with ADHD more commonly have inattentive symptoms and these can be harder to recognise than hyperactive symptoms. Getting help with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) If your ADHD symptoms are affecting your studies, work or relationships, make an appointment with a GP to find out what support is available. At your appointment, the GP will ask about your symptoms and how they affect your life. They may also want to consider other conditions that could be causing your symptoms, such as autism, Tourette's or anxiety, to help you get the right care. After the appointment, the GP may decide to refer you for an assessment with a mental health professional specialising in ADHD. If you have already been diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and need help for your symptoms, talk to your GP about getting a referral. People with ADHD may often have other conditions too, such as depression, anxiety or addictions, or a learning difficulty such as dyslexia. What happens at an ADHD assessment Your appointment will be with an ADHD specialist such as a psychiatrist. They’ll ask about the history of your symptoms, particularly if they started when you were a child, and how these symptoms affected you at school. The assessment will focus on different areas of your life, including: work and education family and friends medical history, including any mental health issues The specialist may want to contact someone who knows you well, such as a family member or close friend. If you’re diagnosed with ADHD, the specialist will talk to you about what this means and what will happen next, including what help and support may be available. Information: Waiting times for ADHD assessments Waiting times vary and you may have to wait several months or years to access ADHD specialist services. You may be able to find a clinic with shorter waiting lists through your GP using the Right to Choose scheme. Read about Right to Choose and your choices in the NHS . You can ask for an NHS appointment at any clinic, including a private clinic, if it provides ADHD services for the NHS in England. Find out more about diagnosis pathways for adults on the ADHD UK website . How to manage ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) ADHD can be managed in many ways, including lifestyle changes, changes at work, or medicines. It depends on your symptoms and how they're affecting you. Not everyone needs or wants to take medicine to help manage their ADHD symptoms. When you get a diagnosis of ADHD, your specialist will discuss ways you can be supported. Lifestyle There are things you can do to help yourself. Make time for physical activities you enjoy, as exercise has many health benefits and can be a good focus for your energy. Exercise also helps reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression can make your ADHD symptoms worse. It’s important to get enough sleep. Having a regular bedtime and a quiet dark bedroom can help. Try to avoid screens, caffeine, sugar and alcohol close to bedtime. Aim for a healthy, balanced diet and regular mealtimes. You may also find it helpful to talk to friends and family about your ADHD. Work, college or university At your workplace or place of study, you can request changes to help you manage your ADHD. These are called “reasonable adjustments”. Reasonable adjustments may include things like: having a personalised work space in a quiet area having written instructions as well as spoken instructions having help from another person to plan and structure your tasks You can read more about workplace adjustments and other ways to help ADHD on the ADHD UK website . Medicines ADHD medicines must be started and monitored by an ADHD specialist. Medicines that can help with ADHD symptoms include methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine.

A child or young person may show signs of being inattentive, such as: being easily distracted finding it hard to listen to what people are saying or to follow instructions forgetting everyday tasks, like brushing their teeth or putting on socks They may show signs of being hyperactive and impulsive, including: having high energy levels fidgeting or tapping their hands and feet talking noisily feeling restless, or getting up and moving around when they’re supposed to sit still finding it hard to wait their turn, or interrupting conversations Most children and young people with ADHD have symptoms of both the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive type. Some only show signs of one type. ADHD is thought to be recognised less often in girls than boys. This may be because girls with ADHD more commonly have inattentive symptoms and these can be harder to recognise. Information: Many children are easily distracted, impulsive and have high energy levels, particularly if they’re under the age of 5. This does not mean they have ADHD. It could be a sign of something else, like being tired, anxious or stressed. Getting help for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) If you’re worried that ADHD may be affecting your child, talk to one of their teachers. An older child or teenager may choose to speak to a teacher themselves. The teacher will usually make a referral to the school’s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO). The SENCO can discuss support in the classroom or with homework, or help with building confidence and friendships. If you're still worried or you think your child needs additional support, you may want to make an appointment with a GP. At the GP appointment, the doctor will ask about the child or young person’s symptoms and how these affect their life. They may consider other conditions that could cause these symptoms, such as autism, Tourette's or anxiety. People with ADHD may often have other conditions too, such as depression, anxiety or addictions, or a learning difficulty such as dyslexia. The GP or SENCO may recommend support groups or training for parents in your area. Asking for an ADHD assessment If support at home and at school is not helping your child, you may want to ask for an ADHD assessment. Speak to a GP or SENCO to request a referral for an ADHD assessment. While waiting for a referral or assessment, the child or young person should continue to get support at home and in school. You can also contact your local council for advice, and to ask if there’s a family hub in your area. Family hubs support children and young people aged 0 to 19 (and up to 25 for people with special educational needs or a disability). What happens at an ADHD assessment The assessment will be with one or more ADHD specialists, such as a paediatrician, or a child and adolescent psychiatrist. The specialist will talk with you and your child to find out more about any symptoms, and about family life. They’ll also ask about your child’s development, such as how old they were when they learned to do things like walking or reading. There may be some forms to fill in before the appointment or as part of the assessment. The ADHD specialist will usually contact a SENCO or teacher, or both, to see how your child is doing at school. They may also ask your child to do a computer-based test to help assess their symptoms. If your child is diagnosed with ADHD, the specialist will discuss what this means and what happens next, including what treatment and support may be available.

If some foods and drinks seem to affect their symptoms, keep a food and drink diary to see what these are. You can share this information with their school. Support at school and at home Discuss with a SENCO what adjustments or support may help at home and school. This may include: splitting up tasks, like doing homework or sitting down to eat, into 15 to 20 minute slots with a break in between each slot giving clear and simple instructions one at a time in a calm voice writing a to-do list and putting it somewhere easy to see giving praise when a child or young person does well, or making a reward chart Medicine ADHD medicines must be started and monitored by an ADHD specialist.

Symptoms Getting diagnosed Treatments Living with AMD Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that affects the middle part of your vision. It usually first affects people in their 50s. It does not cause total blindness, but it can make things like reading and recognising faces difficult. Without treatment, your vision may get worse. This can happen gradually over several years, before it can then get worse quickly over a few weeks or months. The exact cause is unknown. It's been linked to things such as ageing, smoking, high blood pressure, being overweight and having a family history of AMD.

    "title": "Albinism",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/albinism/",
    "text": "Albinism Albinism affects the production of melanin, the pigment that colours skin, hair and eyes. It's a lifelong condition, but it does not get worse over time. People with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin, or no melanin at all. This can affect their colouring and their eyesight. People with albinism often have white or very light blonde hair, although some have brown or red hair. The exact colour depends on how much melanin their body produces. Very pale skin that burns easily in the sun and does not usually tan is also typical of albinism. Eye problems The reduced amount of melanin can cause eye problems. This is because melanin is involved in the development of the retina, the thin layer of cells at the back of the eye. Possible eye problems linked to albinism include: poor eyesight – either short-sightedness or long-sightedness , and low vision (sight loss that cannot be corrected) astigmatism – where the cornea (clear layer at the front of the eye) is not perfectly curved or the lens is an abnormal shape, causing blurred vision photophobia – where the eyes are sensitive to light nystagmus – where the eyes move involuntarily from side to side, causing reduced vision; you do not see the world as \"wobbling\" because your brain adapts to your eye movement squint – where the eyes point in different directions Some young children with albinism may appear clumsy. This is because problems with their eyesight can make some movements difficult for them, such as picking up an object. This should improve as they get older. How albinism is passed on The 2 main types of albinism are: oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) – the most common type, affecting the skin, hair and eyes ocular albinism (OA) – a rarer type that mainly affects the eyes Autosomal recessive inheritance In all types of OCA and some types of OA, albinism is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means a child has to get 2 copies of the gene that causes albinism (1 from each parent) to have the condition. If both parents carry the gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance that their child will have albinism and a 1 in 2 chance that their child will be a carrier. Carriers do not have albinism but can pass on the gene. X-linked inheritance Most types of OA are passed on in an X-linked inheritance pattern. This pattern affects boys and girls differently: girls who get the albinism gene usually become carriers only, while boys who get it will have albinism. When a mother is a carrier of an X-linked type of albinism, each of her daughters has a 1 in 2 chance of becoming a carrier. Each of her sons has a 1 in 2 chance of having albinism. When a father has an X-linked type of albinism, his daughters will become carriers, and his sons will not have albinism and will not be carriers. Genetic counselling If you have a history of albinism in your family or you have a child with the condition, you may want to talk to a GP about getting a referral for genetic counselling. A genetic counsellor provides information, support and advice about genetic conditions. For example, you can discuss with them how you inherited albinism and the chances of passing it on. Read more about genetic and genomic testing Diagnosing albinism Albinism is usually obvious from a baby's appearance when they're born. Your baby's hair, skin and eyes may be examined to look for signs of missing pigment. As albinism can cause a number of eye problems, your baby may be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for tests. Electrodiagnostic testing is also sometimes used to help diagnose albinism. This is where small electrodes are stuck to the scalp to test the connections of the eyes to the part of the brain that controls vision. Treatments for eye problems due to albinism Although there's no cure for the eye problems caused by albinism, there are a number of treatments, such as glasses and contact lenses, that can improve vision. A child with albinism may also need extra help and support at school. Glasses and contact lenses As a child with albinism gets older, they'll need regular eye tests , and it's likely they'll need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems. Low-vision aids Vision aids include: large-print or high-contrast books and printed materials magnifying lenses a small telescope or telescopic lenses that attach to glasses to read writing in the distance, such as on a school whiteboard large computer screens software that can turn speech into typing or vice versa tablets and phones that allow you to magnify the display to make writing and images easier to see The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has more information about living with low vision, including a section on education and learning Photophobia or sensitivity to light Sunglasses, tinted glasses and wearing a wide-brimmed hat outside can help with sensitivity to light. Nystagmus There's currently no cure for nystagmus (where the eyes move from side to side involuntarily). However, it is not painful and does not get worse. Certain toys or games may help a child make the most of the vision they have. An ophthalmologist will be able to provide further advice. Surgery, involving dividing and then reattaching some of the eye muscles, may sometimes be an option. Squint and lazy eye The main treatments for squints are glasses, eye exercises, surgery and injections into the eye muscles. If your child has developed a lazy eye, they may benefit from wearing a patch over their \"good\" eye to encourage their other eye to work harder. Read more about treatments for squints Reducing the risk of sunburn and skin cancer Because people with albinism lack melanin in their skin, they're at increased risk of getting sunburn and skin cancer . If you have albinism, you should wear sunscreen with a high sun-protection factor (SPF). An SPF of 30 or more will provide the best protection. You should also spend time in the shade when the sun is strongest and cover up with suitable clothing and sunglasses. It's also a good idea to look out for skin changes, such as: a new mole, growth or lump any moles, freckles or patches of skin that change in size, shape or colour Report these to a doctor as soon as possible. Skin cancer is much easier to treat if it's found early. Help and support There's usually no reason why someone with albinism cannot do well in schooling, further education and employment. With appropriate help and support, children with albinism can attend a mainstream school. You might like to talk to other people with albinism. The Albinism Fellowship runs meetings around the UK, and has phone and email support . Information about you If you or your child has albinism, your clinical team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Overview - Alcohol misuse Contents Overview Risks Treatment Alcohol misuse is when you drink in a way that's harmful, or when you're dependent on alcohol. To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level, both men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week. A unit of alcohol is 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol, which is about: half a pint of lower to normal-strength lager/beer/cider (ABV 3.6%) a single small shot measure (25ml) of spirits (25ml, ABV 40%) A small glass (125ml, ABV 12%) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol. Find out more about alcohol units Low-risk drinking advice To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low: men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week on a regular basis if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most days and weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. Risks of alcohol misuse Short term The short-term risks of alcohol misuse include: accidents and injuries requiring hospital treatment, such as a head injury violent behaviour and being a victim of violence unprotected sex that could potentially lead to unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) loss of personal possessions, such as wallets, keys or mobile phones alcohol poisoning – this may lead to vomiting, fits (seizures) and falling unconscious People who binge drink (drink heavily over a short period of time) are more likely to behave recklessly and are at greater risk of being in an accident. Long term Persistent alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including: heart disease stroke liver disease liver cancer bowel cancer mouth cancer breast cancer pancreatitis damage to the brain, which can lead to problems with thinking and memory As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems for some people, such as unemployment, divorce, domestic abuse and homelessness. If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism). Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this. Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people. A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including: hand tremors – \"the shakes\" sweating seeing things that are not real (visual hallucinations ) depression anxiety difficulty sleeping (insomnia) This often leads to \"relief drinking\" to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Find out more about the risks of alcohol misuse Am I drinking too much alcohol? You could be misusing alcohol if: you feel you should cut down on your drinking other people have been criticising your drinking you feel guilty or bad about your drinking you need a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover Someone you know may be misusing alcohol if: they regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week they're sometimes unable to remember what happened the night before because of their drinking they fail to do what was expected of them as a result of their drinking (for example, missing an appointment or work because they're drunk or hungover) Getting help If you're concerned about your drinking or someone else's, a good first step is to see a GP. They'll be able to discuss the services and treatments available. Your alcohol intake may be assessed using tests, such as the: Alcohol use disorders identification test (PDF, 224kb) – a widely used screening test that can help determine whether you need to change your drinking habits Alcohol use disorders identification test consumption (PDF, 382kb) – a simpler test to check whether your drinking has reached dangerous levels As well as the NHS, there are a number of charities and support groups across the UK that provide support and advice for people with an alcohol misuse problem. For example, you may want to contact: Drinkline national alcohol helpline on 0300 123 1110 Alcohol Change UK Alcoholics Anonymous helpline on 0800 9177 650 Al-Anon Family Groups helpline on 0800 0086 811 Treating alcohol misuse How alcohol misuse is treated depends on how much alcohol a person is drinking. Treatment options include: counselling – including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medicines detoxification – this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms There are 2 main types of medicines to help people stop drinking. The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium). The second is a medicine to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medicines used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone. These are both given at a fixed dose, and you'll usually be on them for 6 to 12 months. Further reading Alcohol units Carers Trust: caring for an alcoholic Tips for cutting down on your drinking Alcohol and pregnancy The Department of Health and Social Care recommends pregnant women and women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, and the risk increases the more you drink. The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep the risk to your baby to a minimum. If you're worried about alcohol use during pregnancy, talk to your doctor or midwife. If you're trying to conceive, your partner should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over 3 days or more.

It can make you seriously ill and you may need to go to hospital for treatment. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning Symptoms start after drinking a lot of alcohol and may include: confusion slurring words or being unable to speak being unable to coordinate movement, for example, being unable to stand, walk, or pick things up being sick peeing or pooing yourself pale or blue-tinged skin - on black or brown skin this may be easier to see inside the lips, on the gums and under the fingernails slow or irregular breathing having a seizure or fit loss of consciousness Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you think someone has alcohol poisoning you or someone else has had a seizure or fit someone has lost consciousness someone has stopped breathing Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Things you can do to help someone who has drunk too much alcohol Do stay with them because there's a risk they could choke on their own sick or stop breathing sit them up if they're awake, or put them in the recovery position if they've passed out and check they're breathing properly give them water to sip if they're able to swallow keep them warm with a jacket or blanket Don’t do not let them drink more alcohol do not give them coffee or drinks containing caffeine because this can dehydrate people with alcohol poisoning do not put them in a cold shower or bath because there's a risk they could get too cold, fall or lose consciousness in the water do not try to make them sick Treatment for alcohol poisoning You'll need to go to hospital to be monitored if you have alcohol poisoning. It can cause serious complications, like liver and heart failure, which can be fatal. You may be given fluids, which may be given into your veins with a drip. You may also be given help with your breathing until the effects of the alcohol wear off. Causes of alcohol poisoning Alcohol poisoning is usually caused by binge drinking, which is where you have a lot of alcohol in one drinking session. It can happen when you drink alcohol faster than your body can filter it out of your blood. Having too much alcohol in your blood stops your body working properly and can be life-threatening. Alcohol affects people differently. Some people may be able to drink more alcohol than others, with fewer effects.

    "text": "Overview - Alcohol-related liver disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. Symptoms of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) ARLD does not usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin ( jaundice ) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Alcohol and the liver The liver is one of the most complex organs in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is common in the UK. The number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD Stages of ARLD There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained here. Alcoholic fatty liver disease Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for some time (months or years), your liver should return to normal. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis, which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis , is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. Treating alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. But support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services . A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Complications Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol misuse is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure . Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer increased vulnerability to infection Read more about the complications of ARLD Preventing alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week if you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you have been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short-term and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health. See our alcohol advice pages for more information and support. Video: Liver disease In this video, consultant hepatologist Mark Wright explains liver disease and how not drinking alcohol can help.

    "title": "Alkaptonuria",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alkaptonuria/",
    "text": "Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria, or black urine disease, is a very rare inherited disorder that prevents the body fully breaking down two protein building blocks (amino acids) called tyrosine and phenylalanine. It results in a build-up of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body. This can turn urine and parts of the body a dark colour and lead to a range of health problems over time. Amino acids are usually broken down in a series of chemical reactions. But in alkaptonuria a substance produced along the way, homogentisic acid, cannot be broken down any further. This is because the enzyme that normally breaks it down does not work properly. Enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen. One of the earliest signs of the condition is dark-stained nappies, as homogentisic acid causes urine to turn black when exposed to air for a few hours. If this sign is missed or overlooked in a baby or child, the disorder may go unnoticed until adulthood, as there are usually no other noticeable symptoms until the person reaches their late 20s to early 30s. Signs and symptoms in adults Over the course of many years, homogentisic acid slowly builds up in tissues throughout the body. It can build up in almost any area of the body, including the cartilage, tendons, bones, nails, ears and heart. It stains the tissues dark and causes a wide range of problems. Joints and bones When a person with alkaptonuria reaches their 30s, they may start to experience joint problems. Typically, they'll have lower back pain and stiffness, followed by knee, hip and shoulder pain. These are similar to the early symptoms of osteoarthritis . Eventually, cartilage – a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body – may become brittle and break, leading to joint and spinal damage. Joint replacement operations may be needed. Eyes and ears Many people develop brown or black spots on the whites of their eyes. Another sign in many adults with alkaptonuria is thickening of ear cartilage. The cartilage may also look blue, grey or black. This is called ochronosis. The earwax may be black or reddish-brown. Alkaptonuria can cause dark spots in the whites of the eyes Alkaptonuria can thicken the ear cartilage and make it look blue-black Skin and nails Alkaptonuria can result in discoloured sweat, which can stain clothes and cause some people to have blue or black speckled areas of skin. Nails may also turn a bluish or brownish colour. The skin colour changes are most obvious on areas exposed to the sun and where sweat glands are found – the cheeks, forehead, armpits and genital area. Breathing difficulties If the bones and muscles around the lungs become stiff, it can prevent the chest expanding and lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Heart, kidney and prostate problems Deposits of homogentisic acid around heart valves can cause them to narrow, harden and turn brittle and black. Blood vessels can also become stiff and weaken. This can lead to heart disease and may require heart valve replacements. The deposits can also lead to kidney stones , bladder stones and prostate stones. How alkaptonuria is inherited Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. These carry the genes you inherit from your parents. One of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from each parent, which means (with the exception of the sex chromosomes) there are two copies of each gene in each cell. The gene involved in alkaptonuria is the HGD gene. This provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is needed to break down homogentisic acid. You need to inherit two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent) to develop alkaptonuria. The chances of this are slim, which is why the condition is very rare. The parents of a person with alkaptonuria will often only carry one copy of the faulty gene themselves, which means they will not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. How alkaptonuria is managed Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition. A medicine called nitisinone is used to slow the advance of alkaptonuria in adults. Painkillers and lifestyle changes may help you cope with the symptoms. Nitisinone Nitisinone reduces the level of homogentisic acid in the body. It’s offered at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, the treatment centre for all alkaptonuria patients, based at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Find out about the National Alkaptonuria Centre and nitisinone treatment on the Alkaptonuria Society website Diet A protein-controlled diet can be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects when taking nitisinone for alkaptonuria during adulthood. Your doctor or dietitian will assess and advise you about this. Exercise If alkaptonuria causes pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. But regular gentle exercise can actually help by building muscle and strengthening your joints. Exercise is also good for relieving stress, losing weight and improving your posture, all of which can ease your symptoms. But avoid exercise that puts additional strain on the joints, such as boxing, football and rugby. Gentle exercise such as yoga and pilates might help in the early stages, while cycling, walking and swimming may be more suitable for advanced alkaptonuria. Your GP or a physiotherapist can help you come up with a suitable exercise plan to follow at home. It's important to follow this plan as there's a risk the wrong sort of exercise may damage your joints. Pain relief Speak to a doctor about painkillers and other techniques to manage pain. Find tips for managing your pain levels about with 10 ways to reduce pain . Emotional support A diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be confusing and overwhelming at first. Like many people with a long-term health condition, those who find out they have alkaptonuria may feel anxious or depressed. But there are people you can talk to who can help. Talk to your GP if you feel you need support to cope with your illness. You could also visit the AKU Society website , a charity offering support to patients, their families and carers. Surgery Sometimes surgery may be necessary if joints are damaged and need replacing, or if heart valves or vessels have hardened. Your doctor may recommend: hip replacement knee replacement aortic valve replacement Outlook People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy. However, they will eventually experience symptoms, such as pain and loss of movement in the joints and spine, which can affect quality of life. Working and carrying out strenuous physical activity will usually become very difficult, and eventually you may need mobility aids such as a wheelchair to get around. Visit the AKU Society website for more information and support. Sharing your information If you or your child have alkaptonuria, your clinical team will pass relevant patient information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is where your nose gets irritated by something you're allergic to, such as pollen, causing sneezing and other symptoms. For most people it's easy to treat with medicines from a pharmacist. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis Common symptoms of allergic rhinitis are similar to a cold and include: sneezing an itchy nose a runny or blocked nose itchy, red and watery eyes a cough the roof of your mouth being itchy This usually happens within minutes of coming into contact with something you're allergic to. Causes of allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction. Common allergies include: pollen from trees, grass and weeds ( hay fever ) house dust mites animals such as dogs and cats mould wood dust, flour dust and latex You're more likely to get an allergy if people in your family also have them or conditions such as eczema and asthma . Information: Allergic rhinitis is different from non-allergic rhinitis , which is caused by things like having a cold, very hot or cold temperatures and humidity. How you can treat allergic rhinitis yourself You can often treat allergic rhinitis without seeing a GP. If you can, try to avoid the things that trigger your allergies. A pharmacist can also advise you about medicines that can help, such as: antihistamines decongestant nasal sprays or drops to unblock your nose (decongestants should not be used by children under 6) salt water nasal sprays or solutions to rinse out the inside of your nose You can buy nasal sprays without a prescription, but they should not be used for more than a week as this can make your symptoms worse. Find a pharmacy How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution Boil a pint of water, then leave it to cool. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water. Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it. Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat. Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day (making a new solution each time) until your nose feels more comfortable. If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have allergic rhinitis and your symptoms get worse you also have asthma and it's getting worse your symptoms are affecting your sleep and everyday life you're not sure what's causing your symptoms treatments from a pharmacist are not working Treatments for allergic rhinitis from a GP If pharmacy medicines do not help ease your allergic rhinitis symptoms, a GP may prescribe a different medicine, such as prescription steroid nasal sprays or antihistamines . You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment if it's not clear what's causing your symptoms or they're severe. Preventing allergic rhinitis If you have allergic rhinitis, it's not always possible to avoid the things you're allergic to. But there are steps you can take to try to help reduce your symptoms. Do wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen use hypoallergenic bedding and covers, and wash bedding regularly at 60C and above dust with a damp cloth and use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wash pets at least once every 2 weeks and groom them outside regularly regularly wash your pet's bedding and clean any furniture they've been on keep your home dry and well-ventilated, and deal with any damp and condensation Don’t do not allow pets in bedrooms do not go outside or dry clothes outside when the pollen count is high, if possible Information: Find out more Allergy UK: living with an allergy Page last reviewed: 30 May 2022 Next review due: 30 May 2025"

    "text": "Allergies An allergy is where your body reacts to something that's normally harmless like pollen, dust or animal fur. The symptoms can be mild, but for some people they can be very serious. Causes of allergies Things that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. Common allergens include: tree and grass pollen ( hay fever ) house dust mites foods, such as peanuts, milk and eggs ( food allergy ) animals, particularly pets like cats and dogs insect stings, such as bee and wasp stings certain medicines Symptoms of an allergic reaction Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include: a runny nose or sneezing pain or tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead coughing, wheezing or breathlessness itchy skin or a raised rash ( hives ) diarrhoea feeling or being sick swollen eyes, lips, mouth or throat Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air) your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet) you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy someone faints and cannot be woken up a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face) You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised or itchy. These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital. Find your nearest A&E Information: If you have an adrenaline auto-injector If you or someone you're with is having a serious allergic reaction and has an adrenaline auto-injector (such as an EpiPen), you should use it immediately.

    "text": "Altitude sickness Altitude sickness can happen when you're at a high altitude. It usually gets better in a few days with rest, but it can sometimes be life-threatening and need treatment. Check if you're at risk of altitude sickness You can get altitude sickness if you're in a place that is at a high altitude (usually more than 2,500 metres above sea level). You're more likely to get it if you travel or climb to a high altitude quickly. You can get it in places like: Mount Everest in Nepal Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania some places in the Alps La Paz in Bolivia You cannot get altitude sickness in the UK. Information: Check your travel risk You can check if there's a risk of altitude sickness in a country or place you're travelling to on the TravelHealthPro website Symptoms of altitude sickness Symptoms of altitude sickness usually start 6 to 10 hours after being at a high altitude. The main symptoms include: a headache loss of appetite feeling or being sick feeling tired or exhausted dizziness difficulty sleeping Sometimes, the symptoms can develop into more serious symptoms that can be life-threatening. What to do if you get altitude sickness If you're at a high altitude and have symptoms of altitude sickness or feel unwell: tell someone who you're travelling with that you do not feel well rest at the same altitude until you feel better – do not travel or climb to a higher altitude you can take anti-sickness medicine or painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to ease symptoms Symptoms of altitude sickness usually get better in 1 to 3 days. If your symptoms have gone and you feel better, you can travel or climb to a higher altitude. Important: If your symptoms do not get better If your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 1 day, go to a lower altitude if you can. Try to go around 300 to 1,000 metres lower. Urgent advice: Get medical help immediately if: You are at a high altitude and you or someone else: have symptoms of altitude sickness and feel very unwell are confused have problems with balance or coordination are seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations) feel short of breath, even when resting have a cough or are coughing up frothy or bloody spit have blue or grey skin, lips, tongue or nails (on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet) are very sleepy or difficult to wake Go to a lower altitude straight away (around 300 to 1,000 metres lower) if you can. Treatment for altitude sickness Altitude sickness usually gets better without treatment if you rest. You may be given medicine to help ease symptoms. If your symptoms are more serious, you may be given: steroid medicine medicine to lower your blood pressure oxygen through a mask Rarely, you may need to be treated with oxygen in a special air-tight chamber (hyperbaric chamber) to increase the level of oxygen in your blood. How to reduce your risk of altitude sickness There are some things you can do to help reduce your risk of getting altitude sickness. Do travel or climb to a high altitude slowly to give your body time to get used to lower oxygen levels spend a few days at an altitude below 2,500 metres before going any higher have a rest day at the same altitude every 3 to 4 days (if you're at an altitude of 3,000 metres or more) drink enough water so you do not get dehydrated speak to a GP or travel clinic if you've had altitude sickness before or if you're travelling to a high altitude quickly – they may prescribe medicine to help prevent altitude sickness Don’t try not to travel from an altitude that's less than 1,200 metres to an altitude that's more than 3,500 metres in 1 day try not to fly directly to a place with a high altitude – if this is not possible, rest for 1 day before going any higher try not to sleep more than 500 metres higher than you slept the night before (if you're at an altitude of 3,000 metres or more) do not drink alcohol while travelling or climbing Page last reviewed: 31 July 2023 Next review due: 31 July 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Alzheimer's disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. It can affect memory, thinking skills and other mental abilities. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age a family history of the condition untreated depression , although depression can also be one of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease Read more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease . Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks behaviour changes, such as becoming aggressive or suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxiety Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Who is affected? Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. But around 1 in every 13 people with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is called early- or young-onset Alzheimer's disease. Getting a diagnosis As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. Also, the disease process itself may (but not always) prevent people recognising changes in their memory. But Alzheimer's disease is not a \"normal\" part of the ageing process. An accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP. If possible, someone who knows you well should be with you as they can help describe any changes or problems they have noticed. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. And it's important to remember that memory problems do not necessarily mean you have Alzheimer's disease. A GP will ask questions about any problems you're experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist service to: assess your symptoms in more detail organise further testing, such as brain scans if necessary create a treatment and care plan Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease . How Alzheimer's disease is treated There's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medicines are available that can help relieve some of the symptoms. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Read more about treating Alzheimer's disease . Outlook People with Alzheimer's disease can live for several years after they start to develop symptoms. But this can vary considerably from person to person. Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs), which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer's disease to eventually have difficulty eating and have a reduced appetite. There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer's disease need palliative care . This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's. Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented? As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. But there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight staying physically fit and mentally active These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health. Read more about preventing Alzheimer's disease . Dementia research There are dozens of dementia research projects going on around the world, many of which are based in the UK. If you have a diagnosis of dementia or are worried about memory problems, you can help scientists better understand the disease by taking part in research. If you're a carer for someone with dementia, you can also take part in research. You can sign up to take part in trials on the NHS Join Dementia Research website .

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lazy-eye/",
    "text": "Lazy eye A lazy eye (amblyopia) is when the vision in 1 eye does not develop properly. Rarely, both eyes can be affected. Symptoms of a lazy eye A lazy eye does not always cause symptoms and is often first diagnosed during an eye test. The main symptoms include: shutting 1 eye or squinting when looking at things eyes pointing in different directions (a squint ) not being able to follow an object or person with your eyes tilting your head when looking at something having tired eyes and rubbing your eyes a lot headaches difficulty catching or throwing tripping or falling over a lot blinking a lot Many children do not notice anything wrong with their vision. You can check a younger child's eyes by covering each eye with your hand, 1 at a time. They may complain if you cover their good eye. Older children may say they're not able to see as well with 1 eye and may have problems with reading, writing and drawing. Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you're worried about your or your child's vision you have not had an eye test for 2 years Find an NHS sight test What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child have a lazy eye, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You'll be asked to look at lights or read letters while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes.

Treatment for a lazy eye aims to improve vision in the weaker eye. This may include: wearing glasses to correct your vision wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye for a few hours a day for several months – these are usually worn with glasses using eye drops to temporarily blur vision in the stronger eye Treatment should ideally start before the age of 7, when vision is still developing. If lazy eye is caused by cataracts or a drooping eyelid, you may need surgery. You may also need to have surgery if you have a squint. This will straighten the eyes and allow them to work together better, but does not improve your vision.

    "text": "Amyloidosis Amyloidosis is a group of rare conditions where a protein called amyloid builds up in your body. It can affect organs such as your heart, kidneys, liver, nerves or digestive system. It cannot be cured, but there are treatments that may help with symptoms. Symptoms of amyloidosis Common symptoms of amyloidosis include: feeling very tired or weak losing weight without trying to shortness of breath swollen feet or legs bruising around your eyes Other symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected, so you may not have all the symptoms. They can include: a fast or slow heartbeat or chest pain, if your heart is affected loss of appetite, feeling or being sick, diarrhoea or constipation, if your digestive system is affected frothy pee, if your kidneys are affected pain, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet, if your nerves are affected Important These symptoms can be caused by many different conditions. Having them does not definitely mean you have amyloidosis. But it's important to get them checked by a GP. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of amyloidosis How you get amyloidosis There are several types of amyloidosis, with different causes. Causes of the main types of amyloidosis Type Cause AL amyloidosis A problem with your bone marrow. Sometimes linked with multiple myeloma , a type of bone marrow cancer. AA amyloidosis Long-term inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis , or infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) . Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis An inherited genetic condition. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis Develops as you get older, usually affecting men over 75 years old. Beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis Having long-term dialysis . Tests for amyloidosis If a GP thinks you may have amyloidosis they'll refer you to a specialist. You may be seen in a specialist amyloidosis treatment centre. Amyloidosis is often hard to diagnose because the symptoms vary and are similar to other conditions. You'll usually have tests such as: blood tests and urine tests tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) , echocardiogram or MRI scan , to check your heart and other organs a biopsy , where a small sample of cells is removed and tested to check for amyloid a type of scan called a SAP scan, to show where amyloid has built up in your body genetic testing to find out if you have a hereditary type of amyloidosis These tests will show what type of amyloidosis you have and how it's affecting you. Treatments for amyloidosis There's no cure for amyloidosis, but some types can be managed well through treatment to improve the symptoms. But for some people, amyloidosis eventually leads to organs such as your heart or kidneys no longer working properly. Your doctor will explain your treatment options and what to expect. If your amyloidosis is caused by another health condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, treating the condition can improve your symptoms. Other treatments depend on what type of amyloidosis you have and what parts of your body are affected. Treatments may include: medicines to help with symptoms, such as painkillers, anti-sickness medicines, or medicines that reduce swelling (diuretics) medicines to reduce the amount of amyloid your body produces kidney dialysis , if your kidneys are not working properly a kidney transplant or liver transplant, if these organs are damaged Treatments for AL amyloidosis If you have AL amyloidosis, caused by a problem with your bone marrow, you may be offered: chemotherapy to destroy the blood cells in your bone marrow that cause the condition a stem cell or bone marrow transplant Recording information about you and your condition If you have amyloidosis, your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "title": "Anabolic steroid misuse",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anabolic-steroid-misuse/",
    "text": "Anabolic steroid misuse Anabolic steroids are prescription-only medicines that are sometimes taken without medical advice to increase muscle mass and improve athletic performance. If used in this way, they can cause serious side effects and addiction. Anabolic steroids are manufactured drugs that copy the effects of the male hormone testosterone. They have limited medical uses and are not the same as corticosteroids , a different type of steroid drug that's more commonly prescribed. Are anabolic steroids illegal? Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, which can only be issued by pharmacists with a prescription. It's legal to have anabolic steroids for personal use. They can also be imported or exported, as long as this is carried out in person. This means they can't be posted or delivered by a courier or freight service. However, it's illegal to possess, import or export anabolic steroids if it's believed you're supplying or selling them. This includes giving them to friends. The penalty is an unlimited fine, or even a prison sentence of up to 14 years. In professional sport, most organisations ban anabolic steroid use and test competitors for banned steroids. If you do test positive, you may be banned from competing professionally. Why people misuse anabolic steroids Anabolic steroids can be used as performance-enhancing drugs that increase muscle mass and decrease fat, as well as causing many undesirable effects. Some people take them regularly to improve their physical performance and build up their bodies. However, people of all ages have been known to misuse these drugs, including adolescent boys who suffer from body dysmorphic disorder . This is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. These flaws are often unnoticeable to others. People who have body dysmorphic disorder may take anabolic steroids because they don't see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough. Some people believe taking anabolic steroids will help them become fit and healthy. This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit. How anabolic steroids are taken Anabolic steroids are usually injected into a muscle or taken by mouth as tablets, but they also come as creams or gels that are applied to the skin. Many people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and believe that by taking the drugs in certain ways they can avoid side effects. Or they may take additional medicines to try to counter the side effects. Users might: Take the drugs for a period of time and then stop for a rest period before starting again. This is known as \"cycling\". Take more than one type of anabolic steroid at a time, known as \"stacking\", which they believe makes the steroids work better. Do a combination of both stacking and cycling, known as \"pyramiding\", where they start off taking a low dose of one or more anabolic steroids, and then increase the dose over time up to a maximum dose. They then stop taking them for a rest period to give the body a break before starting the cycle again. But there is no evidence that any of these methods actually reduce side effects and harms from taking anabolic steroids. Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time. Side effects of anabolic steroids Regularly taking anabolic steroids can lead to physical and psychological changes in both men and women, as well as potentially dangerous medical conditions. Physical effects Effects of anabolic steroids in men can include: reduced sperm count infertility shrunken testicles erectile dysfunction hair loss breast development increased risk of prostate cancer severe acne stomach pain In women, anabolic steroids can cause: facial hair growth and body hair loss of breasts swelling of the clitoris a deepened voice an increased sex drive problems with periods hair loss severe acne In addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions: heart attack or stroke liver or kidney problems or failure high blood pressure (hypertension) blood clots fluid retention high cholesterol Psychological effects Misusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects: aggressive behaviour mood swings paranoia manic behaviour hallucinations and delusions Stunted growth in adolescents Anabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth. Sharing needles As anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles. These are the same risks associated with recreational drug use, and include: damage to veins, leading to ulcers or gangrene hepatitis B infection hepatitis C infection HIV transmission Addiction Anabolic steroids are addictive. This means you can crave the drug, require more to get the same effect, and have withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop taking it. A person who is addicted to anabolic steroids will want to keep using them despite experiencing unpleasant physical side effects. When doctors prescribe steroid medication, they always advise coming off the medication slowly by gradually reducing the dose. Coming off anabolic steroids suddenly can result in withdrawal symptoms that include: depression and apathy feelings of anxiety difficulty concentrating insomnia anorexia decreased sex drive extreme tiredness (fatigue) headaches muscle and joint pain Getting help You should see a GP if you think you're addicted to anabolic steroids. Treatment for an addiction to anabolic steroids will be similar to that of other types of addiction. The GP may refer you to a specially trained drugs counsellor. They'll discuss your addiction with you, how to safely stop taking steroids, and any obstacles you may face when trying to stop, plus tips for dealing with those obstacles.

    "text": "Iron deficiency anaemia Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by lack of iron, often because of blood loss or pregnancy. It's treated with iron tablets and by eating iron-rich foods. Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia can include: tiredness and lack of energy shortness of breath noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations) paler than usual skin headaches Less common symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia Less common symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia (that are not usually connected to pregnancy) include: hearing ringing, buzzing or hissing noises inside your head (tinnitus) food tasting strange feeling itchy a sore tongue hair loss – you notice more hair coming out when brushing or washing it wanting to eat non-food items, such as paper or ice (pica) finding it hard to swallow (dysphagia) painful open sores (ulcers) in the corners of your mouth nail changes, such as spoon-shaped nails restless legs syndrome Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have iron deficiency anaemia What happens at your appointment To check if you have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will ask you about your lifestyle and medical history. If the reason for the anaemia is not clear, they might order some tests to find out what might be causing the symptoms. They might also refer you to a specialist for further checks. Blood tests for iron deficiency anaemia The GP will usually order a full blood count (FBC) test. This will find out if the number of red blood cells you have (your red blood cell count ) is normal. You do not need to do anything to prepare for this test. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type of anaemia. There are other types, like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia , that the blood test will also check for. Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia Once the reason you have iron deficiency anaemia has been found (for example, an ulcer or heavy periods) the GP will recommend treatment. If the blood test shows your red blood cell count is low, iron tablets will be recommended to replace the iron that's missing from your body. You'll need to take them for about 6 months. Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron. Follow the GP's advice about how to take iron tablets. Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like: constipation or diarrhoea tummy pain heartburn feeling sick darker than usual poo Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects. It's important to keep taking the tablets, even if you get side effects. Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal. Important Keep iron supplement tablets out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron in a young child can be fatal. Things you can do to help with iron deficiency anaemia If your diet is partly causing your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you what foods are rich in iron so you can eat more of them. Eat more: dark-green leafy vegetables like watercress and curly kale cereals and bread with extra iron in them (fortified) meat dried fruit like apricots, prunes and raisins pulses (beans, peas and lentils) Eat and drink less: tea coffee milk and dairy foods with high levels of phytic acid, such as wholegrain cereals, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and tablets Large amounts of these foods and drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron. You might be referred to a specialist dietitian if you're finding it hard to include iron in your diet. Causes of iron deficiency anaemia Heavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medicine. In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet. Bleeding in the stomach and intestines is another common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This can be caused by: taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen and aspirin stomach ulcers inflammation of the bowel or food pipe (oesophagus) piles cancers of the bowel or stomach – but this is less common Any other conditions or actions that cause blood loss could also lead to iron deficiency anaemia. If iron deficiency anaemia is not treated Untreated iron deficiency anaemia: can make you more at risk of illness and infection – a lack of iron affects the immune system may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs – such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure can cause a greater risk of complications before and after birth if you're pregnant Page last reviewed: 26 January 2024 Next review due: 26 January 2027"

    "text": "Overview - Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that cannot function properly. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin. Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell. Symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including: extreme tiredness a lack of energy pins and needles a sore and red tongue mouth ulcers muscle weakness problems with your vision psychological problems, which can range from mild depression or anxiety to confusion and dementia problems with memory, understanding and judgement Some of these problems can also happen if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate but do not have anaemia. When to see a GP See a GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test. It's important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. This is because although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible. Causes of a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These include: pernicious anaemia – where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK a lack of these vitamins in your diet – this is uncommon, but can happen if you have a vegan diet and do not take vitamin B12 supplements or eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 , follow a restrictive diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time medicine – certain medicines, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74. Treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins. Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first. Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections. Treatments may last until your vitamin B12 levels have improved or you may need treatment for the rest of your life. Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for 4 months. In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it coming back. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products and specially fortified foods. Good sources of folate include green vegetables, such as broccoli, brussels sprouts and peas. Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Although it's uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications , particularly if you have been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time. Potential complications can include: problems with the nervous system temporary infertility heart conditions pregnancy complications and birth defects Adults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure. Some complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others, such as problems with the nervous system, can sometimes be permanent.

    "text": "Overview - Anal fissure Contents Overview Treatment An anal fissure is a tear or open sore (ulcer) that develops in the lining of the large intestine, near the anus. Anal fissure symptoms The most common symptoms of anal fissures are: a sharp pain when you poo, often followed by a deep burning pain that may last several hours bleeding when you poo – most people notice a small amount of bright red blood either in their poo or on the toilet paper When to see a GP See a GP if you think you have an anal fissure. Do not let embarrassment stop you seeking help. Anal fissures are a common problem GPs are used to dealing with. Most anal fissures get better without treatment, but a GP will want to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as piles ( haemorrhoids ). They can also tell you about self-help measures and treatments that can relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of fissures coming back. Diagnosing anal fissures The GP will ask you about your symptoms and the type of pain you have been experiencing. They may also ask about your toilet habits. They'll usually be able to see the fissure by gently parting your buttocks. A digital rectal examination , where a GP inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your bottom to feel for abnormalities, is not usually used to diagnose anal fissures as it's likely to be painful. The GP may refer you for specialist assessment if they think something serious may be causing your fissure. This may include a more thorough examination of your bottom carried out using anaesthetic to minimise pain. Occasionally, a measurement of anal sphincter pressure may be taken for fissures that have not responded to simple treatments. The anal sphincter is the ring of muscles that open and close the anus. What causes anal fissures? Anal fissures are most commonly caused by damage to the lining of the anus or anal canal, the last part of the large intestine. Most cases occur in people who have constipation , when a particularly hard or large poo tears the lining of the anal canal. Other possible causes of anal fissures include: persistent diarrhoea inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis pregnancy and childbirth occasionally, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) , such as syphilis or herpes , which can infect and damage the anal canal having unusually tight anal sphincter muscles, which can increase the tension in your anal canal, making it more susceptible to tearing In many cases, no clear cause can be identified. Treatment for anal fissure from a GP A GP can prescribe medicine to help relieve your symptoms and speed up the healing process. This can include laxatives to help you poo more easily and painkilling ointment that you put directly on your anus. Surgery may be recommended in persistent cases of anal fissure where self-help measures and medicine have not helped. Surgery is often very effective at treating anal fissures, but it does carry a small risk of complications, such as temporary or permanent loss of bowel control ( bowel incontinence ). Anal fissures usually heal within a few weeks without the need for treatment. But they can easily come back if they're caused by constipation that remains untreated. In some people, symptoms from anal fissures last 6 weeks or more (chronic anal fissures). How to ease symptoms of anal fissure Adopting some simple self-help measures can make going to the toilet easier. This will allow existing fissures to heal, as well as reduce your chances of developing new fissures in the future. Self-help measures for avoiding constipation include: plenty of fibre in your diet, such as fruit and vegetables and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice – adults should aim to eat at least 30g of fibre a day staying well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids not ignoring the urge to poo – this can cause your poo to dry out and become harder to pass exercising regularly – you should aim to do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week You can help soothe the pain by taking simple painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen , or by soaking your bottom in a warm bath several times a day, particularly after a bowel movement. Who's affected Anal fissures are quite common, with around 1 in every 10 people affected at some point in their life. They affect both sexes equally and people of all ages can get them. But children and young adults between 15 and 40 years of age are more likely to get anal fissures. Page last reviewed: 09 November 2021 Next review due: 09 November 2024 Next : Treatment"

    "text": "Overview - Anal fistula Contents Overview Treatment An anal fistula is a small tunnel that develops between the end of the bowel and the skin near the opening of the bottom (anus). It’s usually caused by an infection near the anus, which results in a collection of pus (abscess) in the nearby tissue. When the pus drains away, it can leave a small channel behind. Anal fistulas can cause unpleasant symptoms, such as discomfort and skin irritation, and will not usually get better on their own. Surgery is recommended in most cases. Symptoms of an anal fistula Symptoms of an anal fistula include: skin irritation around the anus a constant, throbbing pain that may be worse when you sit down, move around, poo or cough smelly discharge from near your anus passing pus or blood when you poo swelling and redness around your anus and a high temperature if you also have an abscess difficulty controlling bowel movements ( bowel incontinence ) in some cases The end of the fistula might be visible as a hole in the skin near your anus, although this may be difficult for you to see yourself. When to get medical advice See a GP if you have persistent symptoms of an anal fistula. They'll ask about your symptoms and whether you have any bowel conditions. They may also ask to examine your anus and gently insert a finger inside it ( rectal examination ) to check for signs of a fistula. If the GP thinks you might have a fistula, they can refer you to a specialist called a colorectal surgeon for further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the most suitable treatment. Tests you may have include: a further physical and rectal examination a proctoscopy, where a special telescope with a light on the end is used to look inside your anus an ultrasound scan , MRI scan or CT scan When to get medical help The GP will look at the skin around the opening of your bottom (anus) to check for signs of an anal fistula. They may also ask you if they can do a rectal examination . This involves gently inserting a gloved finger into your bottom. If the GP thinks you have an anal fistula, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests. Tests you may have include: using a thin tube with a light at one end to look inside your bottom – this procedure is called a proctoscopy scans, such as an ultrasound scan , CT scan or MRI scan Causes of anal fistulas Most anal fistulas develop after an anal abscess. You can get one if the abscess does not heal properly after the pus has drained away. Less common causes of anal fistulas include: Crohn's disease – a long-term condition where the digestive system becomes inflamed diverticulitis – infection of the small pouches that can stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon) hidradenitis suppurativa – a long-term skin condition that causes abscesses and scarring infection with tuberculosis (TB) or HIV a complication of surgery near the anus Treatments for an anal fistula Anal fistulas usually require surgery as they rarely heal if left untreated. The main options include: a fistulotomy – a procedure that involves cutting open the whole length of the fistula so it heals into a flat scar seton procedures – where a piece of surgical thread called a seton is placed in the fistula and left there for several weeks to help it heal before a further procedure is carried out to treat it All the procedures have different benefits and risks. You can discuss this with the surgeon. Many people do not need to stay in hospital overnight after surgery, although some may need to stay in hospital for a few days.

    "text": "Overview - Androgen insensitivity syndrome Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Living with Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) affects the development of a person's genitals and reproductive organs. The 2 types of AIS are called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS). The genitals of a person with CAIS appear female. The genitals of a person with PAIS may appear as female or male. Sometimes PAIS is discovered because a baby's genitals are not as expected for a baby boy or baby girl. There are specialist healthcare psychologists who can help people with AIS understand their bodies and sex development. The sex development of people with AIS means they are usually unable to become pregnant or make their partner pregnant. However, there is help and advice on other ways to become parents if that is wanted. What causes AIS? AIS is caused by a genetic alteration that is passed along the female line to the child. Although people with AIS have XY (usual male pattern) chromosomes, the body does not respond to testosterone (the sex hormone) fully or at all. This prevents the sex development of a typical male. A penis does not form or is underdeveloped. This means the child's genitals may develop as female, or are underdeveloped as male. The child may have fully or partially undescended testicles . But there will be no womb or ovaries. Women who carry the genetic alteration will not have AIS themselves, but there's a 1 in 4 chance each child they have will be born with AIS. Read more about the causes of AIS . Types of AIS There are 2 main types of AIS, which are determined by how much the body is able to use testosterone. These are: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) – where testosterone has no effect on sex development, so the genitals are entirely female partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) – where testosterone has some effect on sex development, so the genitals are often not as expected for boys or girls PAIS is usually noticed at birth because the genitals appear different. CAIS can be more difficult to spot, as the genitals usually look like those of any other girl. It's often not diagnosed until puberty, when periods do not start and pubic and underarm hair does not develop. Read more about the symptoms of AIS and diagnosing AIS . Living with AIS Children with AIS and their parents are supported by a team of specialists, who will offer ongoing care. The team will help you understand your child's sex development. In the case of PAIS, they will talk to you about why they recommend raising your child as a boy or a girl. Children with PAIS will be brought up either as girls or boys, depending mostly on the extent to which their body responds to hormones (androgens), including testosterone. You and the specialist team will decide together what you think is in the best interests of your child. Most children with CAIS are raised as girls. Once you have learned about your child's sex development, and understand how their body will grow and develop, the specialist team can explain the treatment options your child might have in the future. Read more about how AIS is treated . Support and advice You and your child will be offered psychological support to help you understand and cope with the diagnosis of AIS. Children may not need psychological support while they're very young. But they will need to grow up understanding their body and how it works. You'll be given advice about talking to your child about AIS at all ages. You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as DSD Families . Gender identity and gender dysphoria Most children with AIS continue to feel they are the gender they grew up with. In a few cases, older children and adults with AIS feel their gender identity does not match the gender they've been raised as. This is known as gender dysphoria . People with gender dysphoria often have a desire to live as a member of the opposite sex or as non-binary. They may want treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity or how they choose to identify. If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be told about issues of gender identity. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If your child has AIS, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat AIS. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling in the aorta, the artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (abdomen). Most aneurysms do not cause any problems, but they can be serious because there's a risk they could burst (rupture). Symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysm often has no symptoms. You usually only find out you have one during an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening test or during tests for another condition. If an aneurysm gets bigger, you might sometimes notice: tummy or back pain a pulsing feeling in your tummy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have tummy or back pain that does not go away or keeps coming back you feel a lump in your tummy These symptoms can be caused by lots of things and do not mean you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, but it's best to get them checked. Immediate action required: Call 999 if you or someone else: have sudden, severe pain in your tummy or back are struggling to breathe or have stopped breathing have pale or grey skin (on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet) lose consciousness These could be signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm bursting (rupturing). This is a life-threatening emergency that needs to be treated in hospital as soon as possible. Tests for abdominal aortic aneurysm The main test to find out if you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm is an ultrasound scan of your tummy. A small device is placed on your tummy and images of the inside of your tummy will be shown on a screen. You'll usually be told if you have an aneurysm at the end of the test. You’ll also be told how big it is: small (3cm to 4.4cm or smaller) medium (4.5cm to 5.4cm) large (5.5cm or bigger) Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm An ultrasound test is offered to all men when they turn 65, as they're most at risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is called abdominal aortic aneurysm screening . Treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm usually depends on how big it is and if you have symptoms. If it's small, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating healthily may be recommended to help stop it getting bigger. Sometimes you may need: medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol level, which may help stop the aneurysm getting bigger surgery to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting - this may be done if your AAA is large (5.5cm or bigger), is quickly getting bigger or is painful Surgery has risks and side effects which your doctor or surgeon should discuss with you. Abdominal aortic aneurysms often get bigger over time. You'll usually need regular scans to see if it's getting bigger. If your aneurysm ruptures, you’ll need emergency surgery to treat it. How to lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm Making healthy lifestyle changes can help lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or stop one from getting bigger. Do eat healthily exercise regularly try to lose weight if you're overweight try to cut down on alcohol Don’t do not smoke Information: Find out how to get help to quit smoking Causes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens when the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (the aorta) becomes weakened. It's not always clear what causes it, but some people have a higher chance of getting one. You’re more at risk if you: are male and aged 65 or over smoke or used to smoke have high blood pressure have high cholesterol have a close relative who's had an abdominal aortic aneurysm have coronary or peripheral artery disease ( atherosclerosis ) have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a condition such as Marfan syndrome Sometimes an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be caused by an infection, but this is rare.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/brain-aneurysm/",
    "text": "Overview - Brain aneurysm Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, usually where it branches. As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the blood pressure causes a small area to bulge outwards like a balloon. Aneurysms can develop in any blood vessel in the body, but the 2 most common places are: the artery that transports blood away from the heart to the rest of the body (the abdominal aorta) the brain This topic is about brain aneurysms. There's a separate topic about abdominal aortic aneurysm . About brain aneurysms The medical term for an aneurysm that develops inside the brain is an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm. Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they burst (rupture). This leads to an extremely serious condition known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage , where bleeding caused by the ruptured aneurysm can cause extensive brain damage and symptoms. Symptoms of a burst brain aneurysm include: a sudden agonising headache – it's been described as a \"thunderclap headache\", similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before a stiff neck sickness and vomiting pain on looking at light Find out more about the symptoms of a brain aneurysm A ruptured brain aneurysm is a medical emergency. If you think someone has had a brain haemorrhage, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. How brain aneurysms are treated If a brain aneurysm is detected before it ruptures, treatment may be recommended to prevent it rupturing in future. Most aneurysms do not rupture, so treatment is only carried out if the risk of a rupture is particularly high. Factors that affect whether treatment is recommended include your age, the size and position of the aneurysm, your family medical history, and any other health conditions you have. If treatment is recommended, this usually involves either filling the aneurysm with tiny metal coils (coiling) or an open operation to seal it shut with a tiny metal clip (surgical clipping). The same techniques used to prevent ruptures are also used to treat brain aneurysms that have already ruptured. If your risk of a rupture is low, you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your aneurysm. You may also be given medicine to reduce your blood pressure and advice about ways you can reduce your chances of a rupture, such as stopping smoking if you smoke. Why brain aneurysms develop Exactly what causes the wall of affected blood vessels to weaken is still unclear, although risk factors have been identified. These include: smoking high blood pressure a family history of brain aneurysms In some cases, an aneurysm may develop because there was a weakness in the walls of the blood vessels at birth. Who's affected It's difficult to estimate exactly how many people are affected by brain aneurysms because they usually cause no symptoms and pass undetected. Some experts believe it could be as high as 1 in 20 people, while others think the figure is much lower at around 1 in 100 people. The number of aneurysms that actually rupture is much smaller. Only around 1 in 15,000 people have a ruptured brain aneurysm in England each year. Brain aneurysms can develop in anyone at any age, but are more common in people over the age of 40. Women tend to be affected more commonly than men. Preventing brain aneurysms The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid activities that could damage your blood vessels. Things to avoid include: smoking eating a high-fat diet not controlling high blood pressure being overweight or obese Find out more about preventing aneurysms Page last reviewed: 11 April 2022 Next review due: 11 April 2025 Next : Symptoms"

    "title": "Angelman syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angelman-syndrome/",
    "text": "Angelman syndrome Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic condition that affects the nervous system and causes severe physical and learning disabilities. A person with Angelman syndrome will have a near-normal life expectancy, but they will need support throughout their life. Characteristics of Angelman syndrome A child with Angelman syndrome will begin to show signs of delayed development at around 6 to 12 months of age, such as being unable to sit unsupported or make babbling noises. Later, they may not speak at all or may only be able to say a few words. However, most children with Angelman syndrome will be able to communicate using gestures, signs or other systems. The movement of a child with Angelman syndrome will also be affected. They may have difficulty walking because of issues with balance and co-ordination ( ataxia ). Their arms may tremble or make jerky movements, and their legs may be stiff. Several distinctive behaviours are associated with Angelman syndrome, although a child with the condition may not have all of these behaviours. They include: frequent laughter and smiling, often with little stimulus being easily excitable, often flapping the hands being restless (hyperactive) having a short attention span trouble sleeping and needing less sleep than other children a particular fascination with water By around 2 years of age, a small head which may also be flat at the back (microbrachycephaly) may be noticeable in some children with Angelman syndrome. Children with Angelman syndrome may also start to have seizures or fits around this age. Other possible features of the syndrome include: tendency to stick the tongue out crossed eyes (strabismus) skin, hair and eyes that are paler than other family members a wide mouth with widely spaced teeth a side-to-side curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ) walking with arms in the air Some young babies with Angelman syndrome may have difficulties feeding because they're unable to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing. In such cases, they may need to be fed through a feeding tube. Babies with Angelman syndrome may need to be treated for reflux. Causes of Angelman syndrome In most cases of Angelman syndrome, the child's parents do not have the condition and the genetic difference responsible for the syndrome happens by chance around the time of conception. Angelman syndrome usually happens when the gene known as UBE3A is either missing or not working properly. A gene is a single unit of genetic material (DNA) that acts as an instruction for the way an individual is made and develops. Usually a child gets 2 copies of this gene, one from each parent, but only the gene from the mother is active. Most cases of Angelman syndrome are caused by the child not getting a copy of the UBE3A gene from its mother, or the gene not working. This means there's no active copy of the gene in the child's brain. In a small number of cases, Angelman syndrome happens when a child gets 2 inactive copies of the gene from their father, rather than 1 from each parent. Sometimes the cause of Angelman syndrome is unknown. Most children in these unexplained cases have different conditions involving other genes or chromosomes. Diagnosing Angelman syndrome Angelman syndrome may be suspected if a child's development is delayed and they have the syndrome's distinctive characteristics. A blood test is used to confirm the diagnosis. Several genetic tests will be done on the blood sample. These tests look for: any chromosomes or pieces of chromosomes that are missing changes in the mother's or father's UBE3A gene that they may have passed on changes in the child's UBE3A gene that would stop it from working For each child with Angelman syndrome, it's important to know the genetic change that caused the condition. This helps to determine your chance of having another child with Angelman syndrome. Most children with Angelman syndrome are diagnosed between the ages of 9 months to 6 years, when physical and behavioural symptoms become apparent. If your child is diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, you will be able to talk to a genetic doctor about what support they might need. Managing Angelman syndrome Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids: anti-epileptic medicine to control seizures physiotherapy may improve posture, balance and walking ability; it's also important to prevent permanent stiffening of the joints as people with Angelman syndrome get older communication therapy may help them develop non-verbal language skills, such as sign language and using visual aids, or ways to help them communicate such as Signalong , Makaton or PECS ; using iPad applications and similar tablet devices may also help behavioural therapy may be recommended to help overcome behaviours you find hard to manage, such as hyperactivity and a short attention span In later childhood, the seizures usually improve, although they may return in adulthood. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less hyperactive and may sleep better. Most people with the syndrome will have learning disability and limited speech throughout their life. In adults, some mobility may be lost and joints may stiffen. People with Angelman syndrome usually have good general health and are often able to improve their communication and acquire new skills. While there's currently no cure for Angelman syndrome, research into treatments is being done in other countries. There are also clinical trials looking at treatment for some of the symptoms associated with Angelman syndrome, such as seizures.

    "title": "Angina",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/",
    "text": "Angina Angina is a feeling of pain or tightness, usually in your chest. It can be a sign of a heart problem, so it's important to see a GP as soon as possible if you think you may have it. Symptoms of angina The main symptom of angina is sudden pain in your chest, neck, shoulders, jaw or arms. The pain may: feel like tightness, squeezing or pressure, or like a dull ache make you feel sick, breathless, dizzy or sweaty These symptoms may be called an angina attack, episode or pain. They are often brought on by exercise, stress, emotion or cold temperatures – although sometimes there's no obvious trigger. Angina attacks usually last less than 10 minutes and should stop after resting for a few minutes or taking your angina medicine. How to treat an angina attack If you've been diagnosed with angina and get chest pain, follow the instructions you've been given for treating your angina: Stop what you're doing and rest. Use any medicine you've been prescribed – this is usually glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Take another dose after 5 minutes if the first dose does not help. If you still have symptoms 5 minutes after taking the 2nd dose, call 999 for an ambulance. Immediate action required: Call 999 now if: you've been diagnosed with angina and have chest pain that does not stop after resting for a few minutes or after taking your angina medicine you get sudden pain or discomfort in your chest that does not go away – the pain can feel like squeezing or pressure inside your chest, burning or indigestion you get pain that spreads to your left or right arm, or your neck, jaw, shoulder, stomach or back you have chest pain and you feel sweaty, sick, light-headed or short of breath You could be having a heart attack. Call 999 straight away as you need immediate treatment in hospital. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if: you have chest pain or other symptoms of angina that come and go you've been diagnosed with angina and it feels worse than before, is happening more often, lasts longer or happens when you're resting You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at your GP appointment If a GP thinks you may have angina, you'll be referred to a heart specialist (cardiologist). You may have tests including: blood tests an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical activity of your heart checking the level of oxygen in your blood scans, such as an angiogram , MRI scan or CT scan Causes of angina Angina happens when the heart does not get enough blood. This is usually due to coronary heart disease , where the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits. But it can also be caused by the blood vessels in your heart tightening when they should not (vasospastic angina or microvascular angina). You're more likely to get angina if you: are a man aged 45 or over, or a woman aged 55 or over smoke drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week are living with obesity or overweight have high blood pressure or high cholesterol have had heart problems before, like a heart attack or heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia) have close relatives who have heart problems have another condition, such as diabetes, arthritis or kidney disease Information: British Heart Foundation has more information about vasospastic angina and microvascular angina . Treatment for angina If you have angina, you may be given medicine to: treat an angina attack if you have one ( glyceryl trinitrate ) lower your chances of having an angina attack, such as beta blockers reduce your risk of having a stroke or heart attack, such as low-dose aspirin or statins Sometimes you may be recommended to have surgery to increase the blood flow to your heart ( coronary angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass ). Things you can do to help prevent angina attacks If you have angina, there are things you can do to help symptoms or reduce the chance of attacks. Do avoid things that trigger your angina attacks as much as possible, like stress, cold temperatures or eating large meals always have your angina medicine with you – use it as you have been told by your doctor try to quit smoking, if you smoke try to keep to a healthy weight eat a balanced diet have the most active lifestyle your symptoms will allow try to cut down on alcohol if you drink more than 14 units a week Information: NHS help to get healthy NHS Better Health has free tools and support to help you lose weight, quit smoking, drink less and get active. Visit the NHS Better Health website How angina affects your life Having angina means you're at higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It's important to treat it and make healthy lifestyle changes to reduce this risk. With treatment, the symptoms should improve over time and may eventually stop. If your symptoms are well controlled, angina will not usually have a big impact on your life. You'll usually be able to continue with most things, including exercise and sex. But angina may affect your work if you have a job that involves a lot of physical activity, or if you drive buses, coaches or lorries. Your doctor will talk to you about any changes you may need to make, and whether you need to inform the DVLA about your condition. It's also best to speak to your doctor before you take up a new activity or if you're worried about exercising. You may also need to think about practical things like always carrying your angina medicine, having spare medicine available and making sure you have enough with you when travelling.

    "text": "Overview - Ankylosing spondylitis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a long-term condition in which the spine and other areas of the body become inflamed. It's a type of axial spondyloarthritis. In AS changes to the spine can be seen on an X-ray. There is a similar condition called non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, where changes to the spine cannot be seen on an X-ray, but can sometimes be seen on an MRI scan. This information is about AS. The symptoms and treatment are similar if you have non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. AS and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis tend to first develop in teenagers and young adults. Symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis The symptoms of AS can vary, but usually involve: back pain and stiffness pain and swelling in other parts of the body – caused by inflammation of the joints ( arthritis ) and inflammation where a tendon joins a bone (enthesitis) extreme tiredness (fatigue) These symptoms tend to develop gradually, usually over several months or years, and may come and go over time. In some people the condition gets better with time, but for others it can get slowly worse. Read about symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis . When to seek medical advice You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS. If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints (rheumatologist) for further tests and any necessary treatment. Further tests may include blood tests and imaging tests. Read about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis . Causes of ankylosing spondylitis It's not known what causes the condition, but there's thought to be a link with a particular gene variant known as HLA-B27. Read about the causes of ankylosing spondylitis . Treating ankylosing spondylitis There's no cure for AS and it's not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help delay its progression. In most cases treatment involves a combination of: exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness physiotherapy – where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility medicine to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation – such as painkillers, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) medication and other forms of biological therapy Surgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon. Read about treating ankylosing spondylitis . Complications of ankylosing spondylitis The outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others it can get progressively worse over time. Some people with AS are able to remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. However, some people eventually become severely disabled as a result of the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees. With modern treatments, AS does not normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening problems. For example, AS can lead to: weakening of the bones ( osteoporosis ) spinal fractures cardiovascular disease – a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels Read about the complications of ankylosing spondylitis . Living with AS The National Axial Spondyloarthritis Society (NASS) has information on living with the condition, including advice on working, travelling and driving.

    "text": "Overview - Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), sometimes known as Hughes syndrome, is a disorder of the immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots. This means people with APS are at greater risk of developing conditions such as: DVT (deep vein thrombosis , a blood clot that usually develops in the leg arterial thrombosis (a clot in an artery), which can cause a stroke or heart attack blood clots in the brain, leading to problems with balance, mobility, vision, speech and memory Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage , although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. APS doesn't always cause noticeable problems. Some people have general symptoms that can be similar to those of multiple sclerosis (a common condition affecting the central nervous system), such as tiredness or numbness and tingling in different parts of the body. Find out more about signs and symptoms of APS What causes antiphospholipid syndrome? APS is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, which usually protects the body from infection and illness, attacks healthy tissue by mistake. In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies. These target proteins attached to fat molecules (phospholipids), which makes the blood more likely to clot. It's not known what causes the immune system to produce abnormal antibodies. As with other autoimmune conditions, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to play a part. Find out more about the causes of APS Who's affected APS can affect people of all ages, including children and babies. But most people are diagnosed with APS between 20 and 50 years of age, and it affects 3 to 5 times as many women as men. It's not clear how many people in the UK have the condition. Diagnosing APS Diagnosing APS can sometimes be difficult, as some of the symptoms are similar to multiple sclerosis. This means blood tests to identify the antibodies responsible for APS are essential in diagnosing the condition. Find out more about diagnosing APS How antiphospholipid syndrome is treated Although there's no cure for APS, the risk of developing blood clots can be greatly reduced if it's correctly diagnosed. An anticoagulant medicine , such as warfarin , or an antiplatelet, such as low-dose aspirin , is usually prescribed. These reduce the likelihood of unnecessary blood clots forming, but still allow clots to form when you cut yourself. Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there's about an 80% chance of having a successful pregnancy. Most people respond well to treatment and can lead normal, healthy lives. But a small number of people with APS continue to experience blood clots despite extensive treatment. Find out more about treating APS Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome In very rare cases, blood clots can suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. This is known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS requires immediate emergency treatment in hospital with high-dose anticoagulants . Read more about the complications of APS Further information APS Support UK is a UK-based charity for people living with antiphospholipid syndrome.

    "text": "Aphasia Aphasia (also called dysphasia) is a condition that makes it difficult to communicate. It can make it hard to speak, read, write and understand others. It's often caused by a stroke or brain injury. There's no cure, but people usually improve with treatment. Symptoms of aphasia Aphasia causes problems with communication including speaking, understanding others, reading and writing. It affects people in different ways, but symptoms may include: not being able to say the right words , speaking very slowly or with long pauses finding it very difficult to speak, or speaking in very short or incomplete sentences repeating, mixing up or missing out words making up words or sounds not being able to understand what other people are saying, particularly if you cannot see them difficulty reading or writing Causes of aphasia Aphasia is caused by damage to the parts of the brain that deal with language. Common causes include: stroke – this is the most common cause of aphasia severe head injury a brain tumour , or bleeding or an infection in the brain conditions that cause the brain to become damaged over time, like dementia , or alcohol or drug-related brain damage Anyone can get aphasia, but it's more common in people over 65. This is because the risk of stroke and conditions like dementia is higher for older people. There are different types of aphasia depending on which part of your brain has been affected. Information: Find out more Aphasia.org: what is aphasia? Stroke Association: types of aphasia Immediate action required: Call 999 if: You or someone you're with suddenly has: face weakness – one side of your face may droop (fall) and it might be hard to smile weakness or numbness in one arm or down one side of your body – you may not be able to fully lift both arms and keep them there speech problems – you may slur your words, sound confused, or find it difficult to speak or find the right words blurred vision or loss of sight in one or both eyes These can be signs of a stroke , which needs to be treated immediately. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Treatment for aphasia Aphasia is treated with speech and language therapy. A speech and language therapist can assess your symptoms and work with you to improve your speaking, reading and writing. They can help you to find different ways to communicate. Treatment depends on your symptoms but can include: matching words to pictures categorising or sorting words repeating words or rhyming tasks practising ways of communicating without words, like drawing, body language, hand movements and facial expressions using technology – for example, setting your phone to be voice-activated or taking pictures of things you struggle to name recommending speech and language therapy apps or computer programs to help you practise Speech and language therapy may be done individually, in a group, face to face or online. It also usually involves the people around you, like your family or friends, and anyone who may help care for you. Information: Find out more Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists: how to find a speech and language therapist Living with aphasia There is currently no cure for aphasia. How much it affects your life varies from person to person, and depends on the cause and amount of damage to the brain. It can be very frustrating, confusing and difficult if you or someone you know has aphasia. It can affect people's relationships and independence in daily life, and cause anxiety, low mood and depression , loneliness or isolation. Talking therapies and support from your care team can help with these problems. If aphasia was caused by a stroke, head injury or brain tumour, most people improve with treatment, especially in the first few months. People can still improve months or years later, and some do recover fully. If aphasia is caused by a condition that gets worse over time, like dementia, the symptoms are likely to get worse. Treatment may focus on learning and practising other ways of communicating, like drawing, body language or using technology. Speech and language therapy should help, and there are things you and others can do to help manage aphasia.

    "title": "Appendicitis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/appendicitis/",
    "text": "Appendicitis Appendicitis is swelling and infection in your appendix (part of your bowel). It usually causes pain in the lower right side of your abdomen (tummy). It needs urgent treatment in hospital. Symptoms of appendicitis Symptoms of appendicitis usually start with pain in the middle of your abdomen (tummy), around your belly button. After a few hours the pain usually moves to the lower right side of your abdomen, and gets worse. The pain may feel worse when you move, cough or press on the area. It may feel slightly better when you pull your knees up to your chest. Some people with appendicitis do not have the usual pain symptoms. For example, you might have pain that's less severe, develops more slowly, or in a different place. This can be more likely if you're pregnant and in young children and older people. Other symptoms of appendicitis can include: feeling or being sick, or loss of appetite a high temperature constipation or diarrhoea peeing more than usual sudden confusion (in older people) If appendicitis is not treated quickly, your appendix can burst. If this happens your pain may suddenly get better for a short time. You'll then usually have severe pain that spreads to the whole of your abdomen. It may be very painful to move. If you're not sure it's appendicitis Many other conditions can cause pain in your abdomen, including: urinary tract infections kidney stones or gallstones bowel problems such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease conditions affecting your womb or ovaries, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or a ruptured ovarian cyst an ectopic pregnancy But do not try to diagnose the problem yourself. Get medical help if you're worried. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You or your child have pain in your abdomen (tummy) that: is gradually getting worse or does not go away moves to the lower right side of your abdomen You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You or your child have: severe pain in your abdomen (tummy) confusion, blotchy or paler than usual skin (on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet) or difficulty breathing – these could be signs of sepsis Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. How appendicitis is diagnosed If you have symptoms of appendicitis, a GP or hospital doctor will feel your abdomen (tummy) to check for pain and swelling. You'll need to go to hospital for tests and treatment. Tests you may have include: blood tests testing a sample of your pee scans such as an ultrasound scan or CT scan to check for swelling in your appendix a pregnancy test if there's a chance you could be pregnant There's no test that can always show if you have appendicitis. It can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to other conditions. Sometimes doctors will try waiting a few hours to see how your symptoms develop in hospital. If your symptoms mean it's very likely you have appendicitis, or if your appendix may have burst, doctors may recommend surgery instead of waiting for more tests. Treatment for appendicitis Appendicitis is usually treated with surgery to remove your appendix (an appendectomy). You do not need your appendix, so it's not harmful to remove it. If you need surgery, it will be done as soon as possible, but you may need to wait a few hours. The operation usually takes about an hour. The main steps of an appendectomy are: You'll be given a general anaesthetic , so you'll be asleep and will not feel any pain. The surgeon makes some small cuts in your abdomen (tummy), and uses a thin tube with a camera to see your appendix ( keyhole surgery ). Sometimes they'll need to make a larger cut in the lower right side of your abdomen (open surgery). The surgeon removes your appendix by cutting where it's joined to your bowel. If your appendix has burst, the area will be cleaned. Your abdomen is closed with stitches, clips or glue. Sometimes it's possible to treat appendicitis with antibiotics rather than surgery. This may be recommended if the infection has not spread and surgery is high risk for you. Sometimes appendicitis causes a lump where part of your abdomen and bowel stick to your appendix, called an appendix mass. If this happens you'll usually need antibiotics first, and then surgery a few weeks later if you still have symptoms. Information: Find out more about hospital treatment Going into hospital Having an operation (surgery) Recovering from appendicitis Most people recover from appendicitis in 1 to 2 weeks. It may take longer if you had complications such as a burst appendix. After surgery for appendicitis: you'll have some small wounds in your abdomen (tummy) you'll usually have stitches that dissolve so they do not need to be removed you may have some pain in your abdomen and around your wounds you may have constipation or diarrhoea for several days Recovering in hospital After surgery for appendicitis, you'll spend some time in the recovery room, before moving to a ward. You'll be given medicine to help with pain. How long you'll stay in hospital can vary. If you had keyhole surgery you may be able to go home the day after the operation. If you had open surgery, or any complications, you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. You can go home when doctors think you're well enough. They'll usually want to check that you're eating and drinking, and you're able to poo. You might be offered a follow-up appointment at the hospital or with a GP, but this is not always needed. Recovering at home There are things you can do to help your recovery. Do start going back to your usual activities when you feel ready – you may need to take 1 to 2 weeks off work or school, or sometimes longer depending on the type of work you do take painkillers if you need them follow advice you're given about caring for your wounds while they heal be careful when washing or showering, and replace your dressings if they get wet if you have constipation , eat plenty of fibre and drink lots of fluids – you could also take a mild laxative (ask a pharmacist for advice) if you're given antibiotics , make sure you finish the whole course of treatment contact the hospital ward where you had your treatment, or speak to a GP or practice nurse, if you need any advice about your recovery Don’t do not do strenuous activities such as sport until you've fully recovered – ask your doctor for advice do not drive until you can use a car safely and comfortably, including doing an emergency stop Possible complications of surgery for appendicitis There's a chance of complications during or after surgery to remove your appendix (an appendectomy), but these are rare. Your doctor will explain the risks to you before the operation. Complications can include: the wound becoming infected bleeding scar tissue forming (adhesions), which can cause a blockage in your bowel in rare cases an abscess forming where your appendix was removed appendicitis coming back in the small part of your appendix that was not removed (stump appendicitis) Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You've recently had an appendectomy and you have: soreness or redness around your wound that's getting worse (redness may be less obvious on brown or black skin) bleeding or pus from your wound a high temperature These could be signs of an infection. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Risks of a burst appendix A burst appendix (also called a perforated or ruptured appendix) is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as: an infection of the inner lining of your abdomen ( peritonitis ) a life-threatening reaction to infection ( sepsis ) a painful build-up of pus (abscess) a blockage in your bowel problems in pregnancy These complications will need to be treated urgently with surgery and antibiotics. Causes of appendicitis The appendix is a small pouch that's joined to your bowel in the lower right side of your abdomen (tummy). Appendicitis happens when your appendix becomes infected and swollen. This is often caused by something getting stuck in your appendix, such as a small piece of undigested food or hard poo. Appendicitis is common. It can happen at any age, but it's most common in children over 10 years old and young adults. It's rare in babies under 12 months old. Video: what is appendicitis?

    "text": "Overview - Arthritis Contents Overview Living with arthritis Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. In the UK, millions of people have arthritis or other, similar conditions that affect the joints. Arthritis affects people of all ages, including children. Types of arthritis Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the 2 most common types of arthritis. Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK. It most often develops in people in their mid-40s or older. It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. But it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints are those in the: hands spine knees hips Find out more about osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis. It often starts when a person is between 30 and 50 years old. Women are more likely to be affected than men. In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling. The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down. People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body. Find out more about rheumatoid arthritis Other types of arthritis and related conditions ankylosing spondylitis – a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints cervical spondylosis – also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness fibromyalgia – causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons lupus – an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues gout – a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe), but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness and swelling psoriatic arthritis – an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with psoriasis enteropathic arthritis – a form of chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the 2 main types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease . The most common areas affected by inflammation are the lower limb joints and the spine reactive arthritis – this can cause pain and swelling of the joints, sore eyes and extreme tiredness. It develops shortly after an infection of the gut, bowel or throat secondary arthritis – a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards polymyalgia rheumatica – a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause joint inflammation Symptoms of arthritis There are lots of different types of arthritis. The symptoms you experience will vary depending on the type you have. This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have: joint pain, tenderness and stiffness inflammation in and around the joints restricted movement of the joints warm red skin over the affected joint weakness and muscle wasting Arthritis and children Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children. Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and inflammation in 1 or more joints for at least 6 weeks. Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life. Oligo-articular JIA (oligoarthritis) Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects up to 4 joints in the body, most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists. Oligo-articular JIA often goes away without causing long-term joint damage. But there's a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an eyecare specialist called an ophthalmologist are recommended. Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis) Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, is the second most common type of JIA and affects 5 or more joints. It can affect a child of any age and may come on suddenly or develop gradually. The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis . A child with the condition may also feel unwell and may occasionally have a high temperature of 38C or above. Systemic onset JIA Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, a lack of energy and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed. Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age. Enthesitis-related arthritis Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that often affects the joints of the leg and spine, causing inflammation where the tendons attach to the bone. It can cause stiffness in the neck and lower back in the teenage years. It's also linked to a painful eye condition called acute uveitis . Find out more Versus Arthritis: juvenile idiopathic arthritis Treating arthritis There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow it down. Osteoarthritis treatments include lifestyle changes, medicines and surgery. Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation. This helps prevent joint damage. Treatments include medicine, physiotherapy and surgery. Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have arthritis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS treatment for arthritis near you Further information, help and support Versus Arthritis provides help and support for people in the UK with arthritis, plus their families and friends.

It cannot be cured, but treatment may improve the symptoms. You may be able to claim compensation if you get asbestosis. Symptoms of asbestosis Symptoms of asbestosis include: shortness of breath persistent cough wheezing extreme tiredness (fatigue) pain in your chest or shoulder in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertips It can take 20 to 30 years after being exposed to asbestos before symptoms appear. There are sometimes no symptoms. Causes of asbestosis Asbestosis is caused by exposure to asbestos. You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, particularly from the 1950s to the 1990s. You could be exposed to asbestos today if your job involves working in certain roles in old buildings. Examples include: heating and ventilation engineers demolition workers plumbers construction workers electricians Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of asbestosis and think you've been exposed to asbestos Tests for asbestosis A GP will listen to your lungs and ask about your work history. They may refer you to a specialist in lung diseases for more tests if they think you might have asbestosis. Tests may include: a chest X-ray a CT scan of the lungs lung function tests to see how well your lungs are working Treatment for asbestosis There's no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, as it's not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs. But some treatments can help, including: pulmonary rehabilitation – a programme of exercises and education to help manage your symptoms oxygen therapy – breathing in oxygen-rich air from a machine or tank to help improve breathlessness if your blood oxygen levels are low using an inhaler to ease breathing (if your symptoms are mild) Things you can do to help with asbestosis If you have asbestosis, there are things you can do to help ease the symptoms and lower your chances of getting infections. Do try to quit smoking if you smoke – your symptoms may get worse if you smoke, and it increases the risk of lung cancer get the flu vaccination and the pneumococcal vaccination – this reduces your chance of getting an infection that affects your lungs Information: Government compensation scheme for asbestosis Find out if you're eligible to claim compensation through the industrial injuries disablement benefit on GOV.UK .

How you get aspergillosis Aspergillosis is usually caused by breathing in tiny bits of mould. The mould is found in lots of places, including: soil, compost and rotting leaves plants, trees and crops dust bedding damp buildings air conditioning systems You cannot catch aspergillosis from someone else or from animals. Information: Aspergillosis is rare in healthy people. Most people who breathe in the mould do not get ill. You're usually only at risk of aspergillosis if you have: a lung condition, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a weakened immune system (for example, if you've had an organ transplant or are having chemotherapy) had tuberculosis (TB) in the past had severe flu or COVID-19 and needed help breathing with artificial ventilation Symptoms of aspergillosis Symptoms of aspergillosis include: shortness of breath a cough – you may cough up blood or lumps of mucus wheezing a high temperature losing weight without trying feeling tired If you already have a lung condition, your symptoms may get worse. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have a cough for more than 3 weeks you have a lung condition that's getting worse or harder to control with your usual treatment you have a weakened immune system and symptoms of aspergillosis Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you cough up blood You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at your appointment It can be difficult to diagnose aspergillosis and may take time. A GP will check your symptoms are not being caused by something else, like a chest infection. If they're not sure what's causing your symptoms, they may refer you to a specialist for tests such as: X-rays and scans blood tests or tests on a sample of mucus allergy tests a bronchoscopy (where a thin, flexible tube with a camera at the end is used to look inside your lungs) Treatment for aspergillosis Treatment for aspergillosis depends on the type you have and usually aims to help control the symptoms. If it's not treated or well controlled, there's a risk it could damage your lungs. Treatments for common types of aspergillosis Common types Treatment Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or ABPA (an allergy to aspergillus mould) Steroid tablets and antifungal tablets Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis or CPA (a long-term lung infection) Long-term (possibly lifelong) treatment with antifungal tablets Aspergilloma (a ball of mould in the lungs, often linked to CPA) Surgery to remove the ball if it's causing symptoms, often after antifungal treatment Invasive pulmonary aspergillus or IPA (a life-threatening infection in people with a weakened immune system) Antifungal medicine given directly into a vein in hospital Preventing aspergillosis It's almost impossible to completely avoid aspergillus mould. But there are things you can do to lower your chances of getting aspergillosis if you have a lung condition or weakened immune system. Do try to avoid places where aspergillus mould is often found, such as compost heaps and piles of dead leaves open your windows several times a day to air your rooms, especially if you're cooking or using a shower wear a face mask in dusty places or when you're gardening consider using a dehumidifier and an air purifier with a HEPA filter at home keep your house heated at between 18 and 21C in cold weather Don’t do not dry your laundry in your bedroom or living areas, if possible – ideally dry it outside or in a tumble dryer do not open your windows if there's construction work or digging outside Information: Find out more Aspergillosis Patient and Carer Support Page last reviewed: 19 April 2024 Next review due: 19 April 2027"

    "text": "Asthma Asthma is a common condition that affects your breathing. It cannot currently be cured, but if it's well treated you should not have problems with symptoms. Symptoms of asthma The main symptoms of asthma are problems with breathing, such as: wheezing coughing shortness of breath your chest feeling tight Asthma symptoms can be mild or severe. They usually come and go. They may be worse at night and early in the morning. An asthma attack is when you have severe symptoms and it's difficult to breathe, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms can be triggered by different things including exercise, high levels of air pollution, cold air, or contact with something you're allergic to, such as pollen, dust, mould or animals. Asthma usually starts in children, but it can happen at any age. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child have asthma symptoms you or your child have asthma and treatments are not helping, you're needing to use your inhaler more often, or you need advice about using your inhaler you or your child have asthma and your symptoms are not improving or are stopping you doing your usual activities or waking you up at night How to treat an asthma attack If you're having an asthma attack, sit up straight, to help your breathing. Try to stay calm. Use your asthma reliever inhaler if you have one: If you have a blue reliever inhaler, take 1 puff every 30 to 60 seconds until you feel better, up to a maximum of 10 puffs. Shake the inhaler between each puff and use a spacer with the inhaler if you have one. If you have an AIR or MART inhaler (used for both preventing and treating symptoms), take 1 puff every 1 to 3 minutes until you feel better, up to a maximum of 6 puffs. If your personal asthma action plan has a different maximum dose for treating an asthma attack, follow the instructions in your plan. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: You or someone else is having an asthma attack and: start to feel worse at any time do not feel better after taking the maximum dose using an asthma reliever inhaler do not have an asthma inhaler If symptoms are no better after 10 minutes and an ambulance has not arrived, use an asthma inhaler again if you have one, taking up to the same maximum dose. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment if: you've had an asthma attack and have recovered Even if you feel better, it's important to see a GP within 2 days to discuss your treatment and get advice to help prevent another asthma attack. How asthma is diagnosed If you or your child have symptoms of asthma a GP or nurse will ask you some questions and listen to your chest. You may need a simple breathing test to check for signs of asthma, and sometimes a blood test. You may also be given a handheld device called a peak flow meter to use at home for a few weeks, to check how well your lungs are working. Asthma can take some time to diagnose because the symptoms often vary over time and breathing problems can have different causes. If it's likely you have asthma, you may be offered asthma medicines to see if they help your symptoms. Treatment for asthma If you have asthma you'll be supported by a care team including a GP or nurse, and sometimes a specialist hospital doctor. Your care team will explain how and when to use your medicines, how to monitor your asthma, ways to avoid triggers and reduce your symptoms, and what to do if your symptoms get worse. This will be recorded in your asthma action plan, which you'll need to take to all your asthma appointments. You'll be given a printed or digital copy, or both. You should have check-ups at least once a year to see how well your treatment is working. These will include checking that you're using your inhalers correctly and your asthma action plan is up to date. Asthma inhalers The main treatment for asthma is medicines you breathe in using an inhaler. For most people they work well to reduce or prevent asthma symptoms. Depending on how severe your symptoms are, you may be offered either: an inhaler to use only when you get symptoms – this is called an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) inhaler an inhaler to use every day to help prevent symptoms, as well as when you get symptoms – this is called a maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) inhaler 2 separate inhalers – a preventer inhaler to use every day to help prevent symptoms, and a blue reliever inhaler to use when you get symptoms (you should not be given a blue reliever inhaler to use on its own) Important: Using your inhaler It's important to use your inhaler correctly so that your medicine works properly. There are different types, including dry powder inhalers, pMDIs and soft mist inhalers. A doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how to use yours. Disposing of your inhalers Return your empty, unwanted or expired inhalers to your local pharmacy. When you put an inhaler in the bin, gases can leak out and contribute to climate change. Your local pharmacy can dispose of them safely. Other treatments for asthma If inhalers are not enough to stop your symptoms, your care team may also recommend a stronger inhaler or tablets that make breathing easier, such as montelukast . If you have severe asthma that's not controlled by inhalers and tablets, you may be offered other treatments, such as medicines that you inject, called biological therapies. Your care team will discuss with you which treatment is right for you, including any possible side effects. Hospital treatment for an asthma attack If you have a severe asthma attack that does not get better, you may need to be treated in hospital. Hospital treatments may include: oxygen through a mask using a nebuliser to breathe in high doses of medicine steroid tablets or injections Information: Find out more Asthma and Lung UK: asthma treatments Asthma and Lung UK: videos showing how to use your inhaler NHS medicines A to Z: find your medicine Things you can do to help with asthma If you have asthma there are things you can do to help prevent symptoms and reduce the risk of asthma attacks. Do always have your inhaler with you use your inhalers as recommended by your care team try to avoid things that trigger your asthma symptoms, such as air pollution, smoke, pollen or animals exercise regularly – get advice from your doctor or nurse about exercising safely if exercise triggers your asthma symptoms keep to a healthy weight have vaccinations such as the flu vaccine – viruses such as flu can make asthma symptoms worse Don’t do not smoke – get help to quit smoking if you need it do not take medicines for other conditions without checking with a pharmacist or doctor – some medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen and beta blockers can trigger asthma symptoms in some people Information: Find out more Asthma and Lung UK: managing asthma How asthma affects your life Asthma is often a life-long condition, although asthma in young children sometimes goes away by the time they're teenagers or adults. Asthma affects everyone differently. How it affects you depends on your symptoms, what they're triggered by, and how well your treatment works. For most people, inhalers work well to prevent or reduce symptoms if they're used correctly, and asthma has only a small impact on their daily life. But some people have more severe symptoms that are harder to control, and they need other treatment. An asthma attack can be life-threatening. But getting the right asthma treatment reduces the risk. Information: Asthma and pregnancy If you're pregnant, tell your doctor or midwife about your asthma. It's important to manage asthma in pregnancy to keep you and your baby well. Find out more about asthma and pregnancy Causes of asthma Asthma symptoms happen when your airways become swollen. This makes them narrower, causing breathing problems. In people who have asthma, symptoms can be triggered by different things, such as allergies, exercise, smoke, cold air or infections. It's not fully understood what causes asthma. You may be more likely to get asthma if: you have allergies such as eczema, hay fever or food allergies other people in your family have asthma, hay fever, eczema or allergies you were born prematurely or had a low birth weight you were exposed to things like high levels of air pollution or cigarette smoke as a child you had illnesses as a child that affected your breathing, such as bronchiolitis or croup you're overweight Asthma can also be caused by breathing in substances such as certain chemicals at work. Help and support for asthma As well as support from your healthcare team, you may find it helpful to get support from other people with asthma, either at a local support group or online. There are also national charities that can offer support and information about asthma. Asthma and Lung UK Information and support for anyone affected by lung conditions including asthma.

    "text": "Overview - Ataxia Contents Overview Types Causes Diagnosis Treatment Ataxia is a term for a group of disorders that affect co-ordination, balance and speech. Any part of the body can be affected, but people with ataxia often have difficulties with: balance and walking speaking swallowing tasks that require a high degree of control, such as writing and eating vision The exact symptoms and their severity vary depending on the type of ataxia a person has. Types of ataxia There are many different types of ataxia, which can be divided into three broad categories: acquired ataxia – where symptoms develop as the result of trauma, a stroke , multiple sclerosis (MS) , a brain tumour , nutritional deficiencies, or other problems that damage the brain or nervous system hereditary ataxia – where symptoms develop slowly over many years and are caused by faulty genes that a person inherits from their parents; the most common type is Friedreich's ataxia idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA) – where the brain is progressively damaged over time for reasons that are unclear Read more about the main types of ataxia . What causes ataxia? Ataxia usually results from damage to a part of the brain called the cerebellum, but it can also be caused by damage to other parts of the nervous system. This damage can be part of an underlying condition such as MS, or can be caused by a head injury , lack of oxygen to the brain, or long-term, excessive alcohol consumption. Hereditary ataxia is caused by a faulty gene passed on by family members, who may or may not be affected. Read more about the causes of ataxia . How ataxia is treated In most cases, there's no cure for ataxia and supportive treatment to control the symptoms is necessary. This may include: speech and language therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems physiotherapy to help with movement problems occupational therapy to help you cope with the day-to-day problems medication to control muscle, bladder, heart and eye problems In a few cases, it's possible to improve ataxia or stop it getting worse by treating the underlying cause. Read more about treating ataxia . Outlook The outlook for ataxia can vary considerably and largely depends on the type of ataxia you have. Some types may remain relatively stable or even improve with time, but most will get progressively worse over many years. Life expectancy is generally shorter than normal for people with hereditary ataxia, although some people can live well into their 50s, 60s or beyond. In more severe cases, the condition can be fatal in childhood or early adulthood. For acquired ataxia, the outlook depends on the underlying cause. Some cases may improve or stay the same, while other cases may get gradually worse over time and reduce life expectancy. Page last reviewed: 16 April 2021 Next review due: 16 April 2024 Next : Types"

Anyone can get it, but you may be more likely to get it if: you're aged 55 or older you're a man you're living with obesity or overweight you smoke you take certain medicines, such as levothyroxine , lithium or some asthma medicines like salbutamol you do endurance sports like long-distance running, cycling or skiing Atrial fibrillation can also be caused by another condition such as: high blood pressure heart conditions like heart failure , mitral valve problems or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome a heart attack chronic kidney disease an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) diabetes sleep apnoea How atrial fibrillation affects your life There is currently no cure for atrial fibrillation, but treatment should help manage the symptoms and lower the risk of complications like blood clots , stroke and heart failure . You should be able to carry on doing most things as usual, including exercise. But avoid intense exercise and try not to exercise when you're having symptoms of atrial fibrillation. Check with your doctor if you're not sure what exercise you can do. If you drive you may need to tell the DVLA that you have atrial fibrillation. Your doctor will be able to tell you if this applies to you. There might also be other practical things you need to think about if you have a heart condition, like travelling abroad with medicine, and changes to health or travel insurance. Help and support for atrial fibrillation While atrial fibrillation can usually be managed, living with a heart condition can be worrying. You may find it helpful to get support from other people with atrial fibrillation, either at a local support group or online. There are also national charities that can offer information, help and support. British Heart Foundation Information and support for anyone affected by a heart condition.

There are things you can do that can help. Symptoms of auditory processing disorder (APD) Auditory processing disorder (APD) often starts in childhood, but some people develop it later. If you or your child have APD, you may find it difficult to understand: people speaking in noisy places people with strong accents or fast talkers similar sounding words spoken instructions APD is not a hearing problem. People with the condition usually have normal hearing. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child find it hard to hear or understand speech The GP may refer you to a hearing specialist. Tests for auditory processing disorder (APD) To test for auditory processing disorder (APD) you or your child may be asked to: listen to speech with background noise spot small changes in sounds fill in missing parts of words Other tests may include: having electrodes on your head to measure how your brain reacts to sound speech and language tests memory, problem-solving and concentration tests Testing for APD is not usually done on children under 7 years old. Treating auditory processing disorder (APD) There's no cure for auditory processing disorder (APD) but there are things that can help. Treatment usually involves activities to improve listening and concentration. This is called auditory training. You can do it with a hearing specialist or in your own time online. To reduce background noise, schoolchildren with APD may be advised to wear a wireless earpiece that connects to a tiny microphone worn by their teacher. Things you can do to help with auditory processing disorder (APD) There are things that you and other people can do to help with your or your child's auditory processing disorder (APD). Do talk face to face use pictures and text repeat or rephrase things if necessary use carpet and soft furnishings to reduce room noise Don’t do not cover your mouth when talking do not talk in long complicated sentences do not speak too fast or too slow do not have background noise, like TV and radio Information: APD Support UK provides information and online support groups for parents and adults with APD Causes of auditory processing disorder (APD) It's not always clear what causes auditory processing disorder (APD).

    "text": "Overview - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Complications Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children affected by ADPKD are born with the condition, it rarely causes any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this does not occur until a person is between 30 and 40 years of age. Less commonly, children or older people may have noticeable symptoms as a result of ADPKD. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including: tummy (abdominal) pain high blood pressure (hypertension) blood in the urine (haematuria) , which may not always be noticeable to the naked eye potentially serious upper urinary tract infections (UTIs) kidney stones Kidney function may gradually deteriorate until so much is lost that kidney failure occurs. Read more about the symptoms of ADPKD and diagnosing ADPKD . What causes ADPKD ADPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts the normal development of some of the cells in the kidneys and causes cysts to grow. Faults in 1 of 2 different genes are known to cause ADPKD. The affected genes are: PKD1, which accounts for around 78% of cases PKD2, which accounts for around 15% of cases Both types of ADPKD have the same symptoms, but they tend to be more severe in PKD1. A child has a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of developing ADPKD if one of their parents has the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rarer type of kidney disease that can only be inherited if both parents carry the faulty gene. In this type problems usually start much earlier, during childhood. Non-inherited ADPKD In up to 1 in 4 (25%) cases, a person develops ADPKD without having a known family history of the condition. This could be because the condition was never diagnosed in a relative, or a relative with the condition may have died before their symptoms were recognised. In around 1 in 10 cases of ADPKD, the mutation develops for the first time in the affected person. It's not known what causes this to happen. The affected person can pass the faulty gene on to their children in the same way as someone who's inherited it from a parent. Who's affected ADPKD is the most common inherited condition to affect the kidneys, although it's still relatively uncommon. It's estimated up to 1 in every 1000 to 2500 people in the UK has ADPKD. This means there could be between 30,000 and 70,000 people in the UK with the condition. Treating ADPKD There's currently no cure for ADPKD, however: a healthy lifestyle may help to protect your kidney function various treatments are available to manage problems caused by the condition Most problems, such as high blood pressure, pain and UTIs, can be treated with medication, although you may need to have an operation to remove any large kidney stones that develop. If the condition reaches a point where the kidneys are not able to function properly, there are 2 main treatment options: dialysis , where a machine is used to replicate kidney functions a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure A medication called tolvaptan can be used to slow down the formation of cysts and protect kidney function. Find out more about treating ADPKD Outlook The outlook for ADPKD is highly variable. Some people experience kidney failure soon after the condition is diagnosed, whereas others may live the rest of their life with their kidneys working relatively well. On average, around half of people with ADPKD require treatment for kidney failure by the time they're 60. As well as kidney failure, ADPKD can also cause a number of other potentially serious problems, such as heart attacks and strokes caused by high blood pressure, or bleeding on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) caused by a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain (brain aneurysm) . Find out more about the complications of ADPKD Information about you If you have ADPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register The kidneys The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the back of the body, just underneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood and pass them out of the body in urine. The kidneys also play an important role in: helping to maintain blood pressure at a healthy level keeping salt and water in balance making hormones needed for the production of blood and bone Page last reviewed: 23 February 2023 Next review due: 23 February 2026 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Overview - Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare inherited childhood condition where the development of the kidneys and liver is abnormal. Over time, these organs may fail. The condition often causes serious problems soon after birth, although less severe cases may not become obvious until a child is older. ARPKD can cause a wide range of problems, including: underdeveloped lungs, which can cause severe breathing difficulties soon after birth high blood pressure (hypertension) excessive peeing and thirst problems with blood flow through the liver, which can lead to serious internal bleeding a progressive loss of kidney function, known as chronic kidney disease (CKD) When these problems develop and how severe they are can vary considerably, even between family members with the condition. Read more about the symptoms of ARPKD and diagnosing ARPKD . Even though ARPKD is rare, it's one of the most common kidney problems to affect young children. It's estimated around 1 in 20,000 babies is born with the condition. Both boys and girls are affected equally. The kidneys The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just beneath the rib cage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood before passing them out of the body as urine. The kidneys also help maintain blood pressure at a healthy level. What causes ARPKD? ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver. In particular, the growth and development of the small tubes that make up the kidneys is affected, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to develop within them. Over time, the cysts cause the kidneys to become enlarged and scarred (fibrosis), resulting in the deterioration of overall kidney function. Similar problems also affect the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow a digestive fluid called bile to flow out of the liver. The bile ducts may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. The liver can also become scarred over time. ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents. If both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have developing ARPKD. The way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) , which usually does not cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood. Sometimes ADPKD can happen when only one parent has passed on a faulty gene, but this is rare. Find out more about the causes of ARPKD Treating ARPKD There's currently no cure for ARPKD, but various treatments can help manage the wide range of problems it can cause. Treatment for ARPKD may include: breathing assistance with a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs (a ventilator) for children with severe breathing difficulties medication to treat high blood pressure procedures to stop any internal bleeding that may occur medications to control problems associated with the loss of kidney function, such as iron supplements for anaemia If kidney failure does occur, there are 2 main treatment options: dialysis , where a machine is used to replicate many functions of the kidney a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure Find out more about how ARPKD is treated Outlook The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary considerably depending on the severity of the condition. If routine scans pick up kidney problems during pregnancy, the baby will usually have a poorer outlook than a child who's diagnosed at a later stage. But in general, ARPKD is a severe condition and around 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties during the first 4 weeks after birth. About 9 out of 10 babies with ARPKD who survive the first month of life will live until they're at least 5 years old. It's difficult to predict exactly how long a child with ARPKD will live because there's very little data showing long-term survival rates. But with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bird-flu/",
    "text": "Bird flu Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. In rare cases, it can affect humans. There are lots of different strains of bird flu virus. Most of them don't infect humans. But there are 4 strains that have caused concern in recent years: H5N1 (since 1997) H7N9 (since 2013) H5N6 (since 2014) H5N8 (since 2016) Although H5N1, H7N9 and H5N6 don't infect people easily and aren't usually spread from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. In February 2021 H5N8 was found to have infected a small number of people for the first time, in Russia. Bird flu in the UK Plans are in place to manage any suspected cases of bird flu in the UK. H5N8 and H5N1 bird flu have been found in some poultry, other captive birds and wild birds in the UK. H5N6 has also been found in some wild birds in the UK, but this is a different strain to the H5N6 virus that has infected some people in China. You can read the latest bird flu updates on GOV.UK . How bird flu spreads to humans Bird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird (dead or alive). This includes: touching infected birds touching droppings or bedding killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking Markets where live birds are sold can also be a source of bird flu. Avoid visiting these markets if you're travelling to countries that have had an outbreak of bird flu. You can check health advice for the country you're visiting on the TravelHealthPro website . You can't catch bird flu through eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak of bird flu. Things you can do to prevent bird flu If you're visiting a foreign country that's had an outbreak you should: wash your hands often with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling food, in particular raw poultry use different utensils for cooked and raw meat make sure meat is cooked until steaming hot avoid contact with live birds and poultry What not to do: do not go near or touch bird droppings or sick or dead birds do not go to live animal markets or poultry farms do not bring any live birds or poultry back to the UK, including feathers do not eat undercooked or raw poultry or duck do not eat raw eggs There is no bird flu vaccine The seasonal flu vaccine doesn't protect against bird flu. Symptoms of bird flu in humans The main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include: a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery aching muscles headache a cough or shortness of breath Other early symptoms may include: diarrhoea sickness stomach pain chest pain bleeding from the nose and gums conjunctivitis It usually takes 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after you've been infected. Within days of symptoms appearing, it's possible to develop more severe complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . Getting treatment quickly, using antiviral medicine, may prevent complications and reduce the risk of developing severe illness. When to seek medical advice Use NHS 111 online ( 111.nhs.uk ) or call NHS 111 if you experience any symptoms of bird flu and have visited an area affected by bird flu in the past 10 days. Your symptoms can be checked over the phone. If you're abroad Get medical help straight away if you get the symptoms of bird flu. Contact your travel insurance company if you need advice about where to get help. What a doctor can do Tell the doctor if you have: recently travelled to an area affected by bird flu and if you've been close (within 1 metre) to live or dead birds had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with anyone who has a severe respiratory illness had contact with anyone who died unexpectedly and was from an area that had an outbreak These tests can be done to confirm bird flu: a nose and throat swab to see if they contain the virus if you're coughing up phlegm this may be tested for the virus If the tests are normal, it's unlikely you have bird flu. Treatment for bird flu If it's thought you might have symptoms of bird flu you'll be advised to stay at home, or you'll be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients. You may be given an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). Antiviral medicines help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff. Reporting suspected cases of bird flu in birds If you suspect bird flu in poultry or other captive birds, you must report it immediately by calling: 03000 200 301 if you're in England 03003 038 268 if you're in Wales APHA Field Services if you're in Scotland Bird flu is a notifiable disease in poultry and other captive birds. If you do not report it, you’re breaking the law. Read more about notifiable diseases in animals from GOV.UK . Signs that a bird may be infected with bird flu include: sudden death swollen head closed and runny eyes Reporting dead wild birds can also help the authorities keep track of the spread of the disease.

There are things you can do to help ease the pain. Causes of back pain Back pain can have many causes. It's not always obvious what causes it, and it often gets better on its own. A common cause of back pain is an injury like a pulled muscle ( strain ). Sometimes, medical conditions like a slipped disc , sciatica (a trapped nerve) or ankylosing spondylitis can cause back pain. Very rarely, back pain can be a sign of a serious problem such as a broken bone, cancer or an infection. How to ease back pain yourself Back pain often improves on its own within a few weeks. There are things you can do to help speed up your recovery. Do stay active and try to continue with your daily activities take anti-inflammatory medicine like ibuprofen – paracetamol on its own is not recommended for back pain but it may be used with another painkiller use an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel to reduce pain and swelling use a heat pack (or hot water bottle) wrapped in a tea towel to relieve joint stiffness or muscle spasms try doing some exercises and stretches for back pain Don’t do not stay in bed for long periods of time Exercises and stretches for back pain There are specific exercises and stretches you can do to help with back pain.

    "text": "Bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge. BV is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can increase your risk of getting an STI such as chlamydia. Check if you have bacterial vaginosis Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis include: an unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell, particularly after sex a change to the colour and consistency of your discharge, such as becoming greyish-white and thin and watery Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms. Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching. If you're unsure it's BV, check for other causes of unusual vaginal discharge . Non-urgent advice: See a GP or go to a sexual health clinic if: you think you have bacterial vaginosis The condition is not usually serious, but if you have it you may need to be treated with antibiotics. It's also important to seek treatment if you're pregnant as there's a small chance it can cause complications with pregnancy. Information: Sexual health clinics can help with bacterial vaginosis Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urinary system. Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment. They'll often get test results quicker than GP surgeries. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at your appointment If you have symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, a GP or sexual health clinic will want to confirm it is bacterial vaginosis and rule out an STI. You'll be asked about your symptoms, and a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina. A cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge inside your vagina to test for bacterial vaginosis and other infections. Treatment for bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis is usually treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams. These are prescribed by a GP or sexual health clinic. If you have a same-sex partner, they may also need treatment. Recurring bacterial vaginosis It's common for bacterial vaginosis to come back, usually within a few months. If it comes back, you'll usually be given more antibiotics to treat it. If you keep getting it (you get it more than 4 times in a year), you may be given an antibiotic gel that you put in your vagina. You may need to use this for a few months to help stop bacterial vaginosis coming back. A GP or sexual health clinic will recommend how long you need to treat it. They can also help identify if something is triggering your bacterial vaginosis, such as sex or your period. Things you can do yourself There are things you can do to help relieve symptoms and prevent bacterial vaginosis returning. Do use water and plain soap to wash your genital area have showers instead of baths Don’t do not use perfumed soaps, bubble bath, shampoo or shower gel in the bath do not use vaginal deodorants, washes or douches do not put antiseptic liquids in the bath do not use strong detergents to wash your underwear do not smoke What causes bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina. What causes this to happen is not fully known, but you're more likely to get it if: you're sexually active (but women who have not had sex can also get bacterial vaginosis) you have had a change of partner you have an IUD (contraception device) you use perfumed products in or around your vagina Bacterial vaginosis is not an STI, even though it can be triggered by sex. A woman can pass it to another woman during sex. You're more likely to get an STI if you have bacterial vaginosis. This may be because it makes your vagina less acidic and reduces your natural defences against infection. Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy If you develop bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, there's a small chance of complications, such as premature birth or miscarriage. But bacterial vaginosis causes no problems in the majority of pregnancies. Speak to a GP or your midwife if you're pregnant and your vaginal discharge changes.

    "text": "Overview - Baker's cyst Contents Overview Treatment A Baker's cyst, also called a popliteal cyst, is a fluid-filled swelling that develops at the back of the knee. A Baker's cyst on a leg Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/429776/view It's caused when the tissue behind the knee joint becomes swollen and inflamed. The swelling and inflammation can cause: pain in the knee and calf a build-up of fluid around the knee occasional locking or clicking in the knee joint However, sometimes a Baker's cyst may not cause any symptoms other than the fluid-filled swelling at the back of the knee. A Baker's cyst can sometimes burst (rupture), resulting in fluid leaking down into your calf. This can cause sharp pain, swelling and redness in your calf, but redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin. What causes a Baker's cyst? Knee damage caused by a sports injury or a blow to the knee can lead to a Baker's cyst developing. A Baker's cyst can also sometimes occur if you have a health condition such as: osteoarthritis – usually caused by age-related \"wear and tear\" of joints; it particularly affects the knees, hips, hands and big toe inflammatory arthritis – including rheumatoid arthritis , which is a less common type of arthritis and is caused by the immune system attacking the joints gout – a type of arthritis that usually affects the big toe and is caused by a build-up of the waste product uric acid in the blood Baker's cysts usually develop in people aged 30 to 70, although they can affect people of any age, including children. When to see your GP See your GP if you have a lump behind your knee that's causing problems and does not clear up on its own. They'll usually be able to diagnose a Baker's cyst by examining the back of your knee and asking about your symptoms. Your GP will ask you whether you have any associated health conditions, such as arthritis . Tests may be recommended to rule out other more serious conditions, such as a tumour, an aneurysm (bulge in a section of a blood vessel) or DVT (deep vein thrombosis) (a blood clot in one of the deep veins of the body). You may need an ultrasound scan or a MRI scan . Treating a Baker's cyst Treatment will not usually be necessary if you have a Baker's cyst that is not causing any symptoms. Painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be used to reduce the swelling and relieve any pain. A knee support or an ice pack may also help. A bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well as an ice pack. If you have an underlying condition that's causing your cyst, it's important that the condition is properly managed. The cyst may disappear when the condition causing it has been treated. In some cases, it may be possible to drain the cyst. Surgery may also be needed to repair any significant damage around the knee joint. Read more about treating a Baker's cyst .

Symptoms of balanitis With balanitis, the head of your penis is usually swollen, itchy and sore. It usually looks red, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin. Other symptoms can include: pain when peeing a thick discharge that comes from under your foreskin bleeding around your foreskin an unpleasant smell difficulty pulling back your foreskin – though in young children it's normal to have a tight foreskin Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child have symptoms of balanitis, such as the head of your penis being swollen, itchy, sore or red you or your child have balanitis and treatment has not worked Adults can also go to a sexual health clinic for assessment. Information: Sexual health clinics can help with balanitis Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals. Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment. They'll often get test results quicker than GP surgeries. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at your appointment If you have symptoms of balanitis, a doctor or nurse will look at your penis and ask you a few questions. If your symptoms are severe, they may suggest a blood test to check for conditions that can lead to balanitis, such as diabetes. They may also wipe a cotton bud over the head of your penis to test for infections. Treatment for balanitis Treatment for balanitis depends on what's causing it. A GP may prescribe: a mild steroid cream or ointment an antifungal cream or ointment antibiotics If you or your child keeps getting balanitis and medicine has not helped, circumcision (surgery to remove the foreskin) may be considered. Things you can do to help with balanitis If you have balanitis Do wash your penis every day using just water or an emollient (moisturising treatment) gently pull back your foreskin and wash the area with warm water dry gently after washing if you use condoms, choose condoms for sensitive skin wash your hands before peeing or touching your penis Don’t do not use soap or shower gel If your child has balanitis Do gently wash your child's penis every day use warm water and then dry it gently if they wear nappies, change your child's nappies often Don’t do not use soap, bubble bath or baby wipes do not pull your child's foreskin back if it's fixed in place Causes of balanitis Causes of balanitis include: not washing your penis properly some young boys have a very tight foreskin (phimosis) , which means they cannot pull it back to clean under it thrush a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia – if a STI is suspected you may be referred to a sexual health clinic substances such as soap, shower gels or condoms may irritate the skin diabetes – high levels of sugar in your pee can cause thrush Page last reviewed: 30 May 2023 Next review due: 30 May 2026"

    "text": "Bartholin's cyst A Bartholin’s cyst is a lump near the opening of the vagina. They do not always need treatment, but always get any lumps checked by a GP. Bartholin's cysts usually affect women aged between 20 and 50 years. They can affect anyone with a vagina. Check if it's a Bartholin's cyst The main symptom of a Bartholin’s cyst is a soft lump on 1 side near the opening of your vagina. It can be small and painless and may not cause any symptoms. A Bartholin’s cyst can range in size, from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball. Other symptoms can include: discomfort or pain in the area surrounding your vagina (vulva) when you walk, sit down, or have sex 1 side of your vaginal lips looking larger or swollen If the cyst becomes infected, it may turn into an abscess. Symptoms include: smelly discharge from the abscess feeling unwell, or having a high temperature intense pain around the abscess A Bartholin’s cyst can sometimes be found during routine examinations like cervical screening (smear test). See what a Bartholin's cyst looks like A Bartholin's cyst inside the opening of the vagina. Credit: RICHARD USATINE MD / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY: https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1319217/view Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have a lump in or around your vagina Urgent advice: Get an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if: You have a lump in or around your vagina and: it gets bigger and more painful within hours or days there is pus in the lump you feel unwell or have a high temperature the lump becomes tender, swollen, hot and red – redness may be harder to see on black or brown skin These could be signs of an infected Bartholin’s cyst (abscess). You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at the GP appointment The GP will look at the lump to check if it’s a Bartholin’s cyst. Let them know if you'd like someone else to be in the room with you (a chaperone) – this could be someone you know, a nurse or a trained member of staff. If the GP is not sure what’s causing the lump, they may refer you for further tests. Things you can do to treat a Bartholin's cyst If you've been diagnosed with a Bartholin's cyst it will often go away by itself without treatment. But there are things you can do to help relieve discomfort or pain. Do sit in a bath with warm water a few times a day, for 3 to 4 days dip a cloth or cotton wool in warm water and hold it gently on the cyst take ibuprofen or paracetamo l to help with pain Don’t do not try to squeeze or drain the fluid from a Bartholin’s cyst yourself, as this can cause infection Information: What to do if a Bartholin's cyst bursts If a Bartholin’s cyst bursts on its own, this is OK and should ease the pain. Keep the area clean and dry to help stop infection. Treatment for a Bartholin’s cyst If you have an infected Bartholin's cyst, you’ll be offered antibiotics . If antibiotics do not work, or the cyst keeps coming back, you may need a surgical procedure to drain it. Draining a Bartholin's cyst may be done under local anaesthetic where you'll be awake during the procedure, or with a general anaesthetic where you'll be asleep. The procedure involves making a cut in the cyst. The doctor may leave a small opening so fluid can drain out, or insert a small, thin tube (catheter) into the cyst. You’ll usually have the catheter in for around 4 weeks before it is removed. During the procedure, the doctor may take some fluid from the lump to test for infection. What causes a Bartholin’s cyst A Bartholin’s cyst happens when small glands in the vagina become blocked. It's often not known why the glands become blocked. If a Bartholin’s cyst becomes infected, this can cause an abscess. A Bartholin’s abscess may be caused by infections, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia . Page last reviewed: 23 April 2025 Next review due: 23 April 2028"

A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is also possible but rare. How you can treat bedbug bites Bedbug bites usually clear up on their own in a week or so. Things you can do include: putting something cool, like a clean, damp cloth, on the affected area to help with the itching and any swelling keeping the affected area clean not scratching the bites to avoid getting an infection A pharmacist can help with bedbug bites You can ask a pharmacist about: mild steroid cream like hydrocortisone cream to ease bedbug bites (children under 10 and pregnant women should get advice from a doctor before using hydrocortisone cream) antihistamines – these may help if the bites are very itchy and you're unable to sleep Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: bedbug bites are still very painful, swollen or itchy after trying treatments from a pharmacist the pain or swelling around the bites is spreading You may have an infection and need treatment with antibiotics. How to get rid of bedbugs If you think you have bedbugs, you should contact your local council or pest control service. It's very difficult to get rid of bedbugs yourself because they can be hard to find and may be resistant to some insecticides. There are some things you can try yourself, but these are unlikely to get rid of bedbugs completely. Do wash affected bedding and clothing on a hot wash (60C) and tumble dry on a hot setting for at least 30 minutes put affected clothing and bedding in a plastic bag and put it in the freezer for 3 or 4 days clean and vacuum regularly – bedbugs are found in both clean and dirty places, but regular cleaning will help you spot them early Don’t do not keep clutter around your bed do not bring secondhand furniture indoors without carefully checking it first do not take luggage or clothing indoors without checking it carefully if you have come from somewhere where you know there were bedbugs Information: Find your local council You can find your local council on GOV.UK .

    "title": "Overview-Behçet's disease",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/behcets-disease/",
    "text": "Overview - Behçet's disease Contents Overview Symptoms Treatment Behçet's disease, or Behçet's syndrome, is a rare and poorly understood condition that results in inflammation of the blood vessels and tissues. Confirming a diagnosis of Behçet's disease can be difficult because the symptoms are so wide-ranging and general (they can be shared with a number of other conditions). Symptoms of Behçet's disease The main symptoms of Behçet's disease include: genital and mouth ulcers red, painful eyes and blurred vision acne -like spots headaches painful, stiff and swollen joints In severe cases, there's also a risk of serious and potentially life-threatening problems, such as permanent vision loss and strokes . Most people with the condition experience episodes where their symptoms are severe (flare-ups or relapses), followed by periods where the symptoms disappear (remission). Symptom's often start in adults in their 20s and 30s, but can also start in childhood. Over time, some of the symptoms can settle down and become less troublesome, although they may never resolve completely. Read about the symptoms of Behçet's disease Diagnosing Behçet's disease There's no definitive test that can be used to diagnose Behçet's disease. Several tests may be necessary to check for signs of the condition, or to help rule out other causes, including: blood tests urine tests scans, such as X-rays , a CT scan or an MRI scan a skin biopsy a pathergy test – which involves pricking your skin with a needle to see if a particular red spot appears within the next day or two; people with Behçet's disease often have particularly sensitive skin Current guidelines state a diagnosis of Behçet's disease can usually be confidently made if you've experienced at least 3 episodes of mouth ulcers over the past 12 months and you have at least 2 of the following symptoms: genital ulcers eye inflammation skin lesions (any unusual growths or abnormalities that develop on the skin) pathergy (hypersensitive skin) Other potential causes also need to be ruled out before the diagnosis is made. Causes of Behçet's disease The cause of Behçet's disease is unknown, although most experts believe it's an autoinflammatory condition. An autoinflammatory condition is where there are repeated episodes of inflammation in the body. In Behçet's disease, this involves inflammation of the blood vessels. This is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system. It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, but 2 things are thought to play a role: genes – Behçet's disease tends to be much more common in certain ethnic groups where the genes that are linked to the condition may be more common environmental factors – although a specific environmental factor has not been identified, rates of Behçet's disease are lower in people from an at-risk ethnic group who live outside their native country Behçet's disease is more common in the Far East, the Middle East and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey and Israel. People of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Asian origin are thought to be most likely to develop the condition, although it can affect all ethnic groups. Treating Behçet's disease There's no cure for Behçet's disease, but it's often possible to control the symptoms with medicines that reduce inflammation in the affected parts of the body. These medicines include: steroids – powerful anti-inflammatory medicines immunosuppressants – medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system biological therapies – medicines that target the biological processes involved in the process of inflammation Your healthcare team will create a specific treatment plan for you depending on your symptoms. Find out more about treating Behçet's disease Specialist Behçet's disease centres There are 3 NHS Centres of Excellence that have been set up to help diagnose and treat people with Behçet's disease in England. These are located in London, Birmingham and Liverpool. You may be referred to one of these centres so a diagnosis can be confirmed. Staff at these centres may also liaise with specialists at other centres to help with a person's management and treatment, even if they're not seen directly. You can find out more about these centres on the Behçet's Syndrome Centres of Excellence website . If you have Behçet's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Further information about Behçet's disease A natural response to receiving a diagnosis of a complex condition such as Behçet's disease is to find out as much as possible about the condition. However, in the UK this may be difficult because Behçet's disease is so rare that many healthcare professionals know little about it. A good place to start to learn more about Behçet's disease is from Behçet's UK – the UK's main patient support group for people with Behçet's disease. Its website has a range of information about different aspects of Behçet's disease, a members' forum, blogs and links to other useful resources.

    "text": "Non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours A brain tumour is where cells in the brain grow in an uncontrolled way. Non-cancerous tumours (also called low-grade or benign tumours) usually grow slowly and are less likely to spread than cancerous tumours. Information: There is separate information about cancerous (malignant) brain tumours . Symptoms of a brain tumour The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on which part of the brain is affected. As non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly, the symptoms usually come on gradually and may get worse slowly over months or years. Symptoms of a brain tumour can include: headaches that get worse over time or do not go away – although it's unusual for a headache to be the only symptom seizures (fits) feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) feeling sleepy or dizzy changes in your eyesight, such as blurred or double vision changes in behaviour or personality, such as confusion or problems with memory and concentration problems with speech, movement and balance Brain tumours can affect people of any age. They're more common in older adults, but some types can affect young adults or children. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you keep getting headaches, they do not go away or they're getting worse you have headaches that wake you up at night or are worse in the morning you have any other symptoms of a brain tumour that do not go away Get help from 111 online or call 111. Call 111 for a child under 5 years old. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you have a headache that came on suddenly and is extremely painful someone has a seizure (fit) for the first time Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. What happens at your GP appointment If you have symptoms of a brain tumour or another problem affecting the brain, a GP may do some simple tests to check things like your eyesight, balance and memory. If there are signs of a possible problem, they may refer you for a brain scan or to a brain specialist (neurologist) for more tests. Being referred for tests does not mean anything is seriously wrong. Tests to check for a brain tumour The main test to check for a tumour is a brain scan (usually an MRI scan ). This can show if you have a possible tumour, but you'll usually need more tests to confirm it. Most people have a procedure to remove a small sample of cells for testing. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy can show what type of tumour you have and how fast it's likely to grow (called the \"grade\"). Brain tumours are given a grade from 1 to 4. Grades 1 and 2 are generally considered to be non-cancerous (low-grade or benign) because they grow more slowly. Important: Driving You must tell the DVLA if you have a brain tumour. You may not be allowed to drive until after the tumour has been treated. This depends on the type of tumour you have, where it is in the brain and what symptoms you have. Find out how to tell the DVLA you have a brain tumour on GOV.UK Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: getting diagnosed with a brain tumour Cancer Research UK: brain tumours and driving Types of non-cancerous brain tumour There are many different types of non-cancerous brain tumour. Each type affects a different part of the brain. Some types of brain tumour can be either non-cancerous or cancerous. Some types are only non-cancerous. Common types of non-cancerous brain tumour Type Area affected Meningioma The thin layer of tissue covering the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Glioma The cells that support and protect the nerve cells in the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Acoustic neuroma The nerve connecting the brain to the inner ear Pituitary adenoma A pea-sized gland in the brain that produces hormones (pituitary gland) Information: Find out more The Brain Tumour Charity: adult brain tumour types The Brain Tumour Charity: child brain tumour types Treatment for non-cancerous brain tumours Non-cancerous brain tumours are usually treatable. Your treatment depends on the type of tumour it is, where it is in your brain and any symptoms you have. You may not need treatment straight away because non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly. You might just have regular check-ups and scans to monitor it. If treatment is needed, the main treatment is surgery to remove the tumour. This usually involves cutting out a small piece of skull so the surgeon can remove the tumour. The piece is then fixed back in place and the cut in your skin is closed with stitches. Some people may need other treatments, such as: radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill the tumour cells) chemotherapy (where medicines are used to kill the tumour cells) treatment for any symptoms caused by the tumour (for example, medicines for nausea, seizures or pain) Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: treatment for brain tumours The Brain Tumour Charity: neurosurgery for brain tumours Recovering from a non-cancerous brain tumour Most non-cancerous brain tumours can be successfully treated, but it can take a while to recover from the effects of a tumour and any treatment you had. Side effects of a brain tumour, or treatment for a brain tumour, may include: extreme tiredness (fatigue) problems with your concentration or memory problems with your speech, vision or movement changes to your mood or personality For some people, side effects may start months or years after treatment finishes. You may need treatment and support to help you recover, such as: exercises and help with movement from a physiotherapist help with speech and communication problems from a speech and language therapist changes to your home and advice about making everyday tasks easier from an occupational therapist help with your mental health from a counsellor or psychologist There's also a small chance a tumour could come back or could become cancerous, so you'll have regular check-ups and scans for at least a few years after treatment.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/enlarged-prostate/",
    "text": "Enlarged prostate An enlarged prostate (sometimes called benign prostate enlargement) is when your prostate gets bigger. It's common and is not usually serious, but there are treatments that can help if you need them. An enlarged prostate is most common in men over 50 years old. It can affect anyone with a prostate. What the prostate is The prostate is a small gland below the bladder that makes semen and controls the flow of pee from your bladder to your penis. If it gets bigger (enlarged) it can put pressure on the tube that carries pee from your bladder (urethra), causing problems with peeing. Credit: Multimedia Team - nhs.uk Symptoms of an enlarged prostate The main symptoms of an enlarged prostate are problems with peeing, such as: difficulty starting to pee, or having to push or strain to pee a weak flow of pee, stopping and starting, and taking longer than usual to empty your bladder feeling like you cannot fully empty your bladder dribbling pee after you finish peeing needing to pee more often or urgently, including getting up to pee during the night The symptoms usually develop slowly, and may gradually get worse as you get older. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have difficulty peeing or need to pee more frequently Try not to be embarrassed. The GP will be used to talking about these symptoms. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have blood in your pee – your pee may look pink, red or brown you have pain when peeing you cannot pee at all You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Important It's important to get these symptoms checked by a GP because they can sometimes be caused by other more serious conditions, such as prostate cancer . If they're caused by cancer, finding it early may mean it's easier to treat. How an enlarged prostate is diagnosed If a GP thinks you could have an enlarged prostate they'll ask about your symptoms, such as how often you pee. They may ask to examine your tummy (abdomen) and penis, and feel inside your bottom with their finger to check the size of your prostate ( rectal examination ). They'll usually ask you to keep a record for at least 3 days of how much you drink, and how often and how much you pee. Tests the GP might do include: testing a sample of your pee a blood test called a PSA test They may refer you to a specialist in hospital for more tests, such as: a urine flow test, where you pee into a machine that measures how you pee an ultrasound scan of your bladder a procedure to look inside your bladder with a camera ( cystoscopy ) Treatment for an enlarged prostate An enlarged prostate does not always need treatment. It depends on your symptoms and how they're affecting you. If your symptoms are not causing many problems, doctors will usually recommend trying lifestyle changes first. If your symptoms get worse you may need medicines or surgery. Medicines for an enlarged prostate If you have moderate or severe symptoms you may be offered medicines for an enlarged prostate, including: medicines that help you to pee, such as tamsulosin , doxazosin or alfuzosin medicines that help with needing to pee more often or more urgently, such as oxybutynin or tolterodine medicines that help stop your prostate growing, by reducing hormone levels, if you're at high risk of your condition getting worse, such as finasteride or dutasteride These medicines can cause side effects. Your doctor will explain the benefits and possible side effects and help you decide if they are right for you. You'll have regular check-ups to see how well the medicine is working. Surgery for an enlarged prostate You might be offered surgery if medicines have not helped, or your symptoms are severe. The most common surgery you may be offered for an enlarged prostate is called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) . This involves removing part of your prostate through a thin tube that's passed up your penis to your prostate. Sometimes you may be offered a different procedure, but they may not be suitable for everyone. They include: removing or destroying part of your prostate using lasers, an electrical current, steam or a jet of water holding part of your prostate open and widening your urethra, using a small implant making small cuts in your prostate around the opening to the bladder removing part of your prostate using surgery The surgeon will explain your options, the risks and benefits of the procedure, and what will happen. Treatments and support for living with an enlarged prostate Treatment and support is also available to help with symptoms of an enlarged prostate. This can include: products such as pads, pants or sheaths to help with leaks or dribbling pee a urinary catheter – a flexible tube that's put into your bladder to drain pee, if you cannot empty your bladder help with bladder training, where you try holding on for a short time when you need to pee, and gradually increase the time over a few weeks pelvic floor muscle training – exercises to strengthen muscles that help control your bladder Information: Find out more NHS England: decision support tool – making a decision about enlarged prostate Prostate Cancer UK: how is an enlarged prostate treated? NHS medicines A to Z: find your medicine Things you can do to help with enlarged prostate symptoms There are things you can do that may help with symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Do cut down on alcohol and caffeine, as they can make you pee more reduce how much fluid you drink before bed or before going out – but make sure you drink enough during the rest of the day make sure you eat enough fibre to help prevent constipation , which can put pressure on your bladder keep to a healthy weight , as being overweight can make symptoms worse wait a few moments after you pee and then try peeing again, to help you empty your bladder try putting your fingertips 3 finger widths behind your scrotum after you finish peeing, and gently pressing while moving your fingers forwards and upwards towards the base of your penis, to help push the last few drops out check with a doctor or pharmacist whether any medicines you take for other conditions could be making your symptoms worse Don’t do not strain or push when peeing – try to relax when you pee do not cut down too much on fluids, as this can cause problems such as urinary tract infections Causes of an enlarged prostate It's thought that an enlarged prostate may be caused by changes in your hormone levels as you get older. An enlarged prostate is very common. You may be more likely to get it if you're over 50, and if others in your family have an enlarged prostate. An enlarged prostate is not caused by prostate cancer, and does not increase your risk of getting prostate cancer.

    "title": "Schistosomiasis (bilharzia)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/schistosomiasis/",
    "text": "Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is an infection caused by a parasitic worm that lives in fresh water in subtropical and tropical regions. The parasite is most commonly found throughout Africa, but also lives in parts of South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia. Travel Health Pro has a map of where schistosomiasis is found You often don't have any symptoms when you first become infected with schistosomiasis, but the parasite can remain in the body for many years and cause damage to organs such as the bladder, kidneys and liver. The infection can be easily treated with a short course of medicine, so see your GP if you think you might have it. How you get schistosomiasis The worms that cause schistosomiasis live in fresh water, such as: ponds lakes rivers reservoirs canals Showers that take unfiltered water directly from lakes or rivers may also spread the infection, but the worms aren't found in the sea, chlorinated swimming pools or properly treated water supplies. You can become infected if you come into contact with contaminated water – for example, when paddling, swimming or washing – and the tiny worms burrow into your skin. Once in your body, the worms move through your blood to areas such as the liver and bowel. After a few weeks, the worms start to lay eggs. Some eggs remain inside the body and are attacked by the immune system, while some are passed out in the person's pee or poo. Without treatment, the worms can keep laying eggs for several years. If the eggs pass out of the body into water, they release tiny larvae that need to grow inside freshwater snails for a few weeks before they're able to infect another person. This means it's not possible to catch the infection from someone else who has it. Symptoms of schistosomiasis Many people with schistosomiasis don't have any symptoms, or don't experience any for several months or even years. You probably won't notice that you've been infected, although occasionally people get small, itchy red bumps on their skin for a few days where the worms burrowed in. After a few weeks, some people develop: a high temperature (fever) an itchy, red, blotchy and raised rash a cough diarrhoea muscle and joint pain tummy pain a general sense of feeling unwell These symptoms, known as acute schistosomiasis, often get better by themselves within a few weeks. But it's still important to get treated because the parasite can remain in your body and lead to long-term problems. Long-term problems caused by schistosomiasis Some people with schistosomiasis, regardless of whether they had any initial symptoms or not, eventually develop more serious problems in parts of the body the eggs have travelled to. This is known as chronic schistosomiasis. Chronic schistosomiasis can include a range of symptoms and problems, depending on the exact area that's infected. For example, an infection in the: digestive system can cause anaemia , tummy pain and swelling, diarrhoea and blood in your poo urinary system can cause irritation of the bladder ( cystitis ), pain when peeing, a frequent need to pee, and blood in your pee heart and lungs can cause a persistent cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing up blood nervous system or brain can cause seizures (fits), headaches , weakness and numbness in your legs, and dizziness Without treatment, affected organs can become permanently damaged. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP if you develop the symptoms above and you've travelled in parts of the world where schistosomiasis is found, or if you're concerned that you may have been exposed to the parasites while travelling. Tell your GP about your travel history and whether you think you may have been exposed to potentially contaminated water. If your GP suspects schistosomiasis, they may refer you to an expert in tropical diseases. The diagnosis is usually made by finding eggs in a sample of your pee or poo. You may also be diagnosed by a blood test. Treatments for schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis can usually be treated successfully with a short course of a medication called praziquantel, which kills the worms. Praziquantel is most effective once the worms have grown a bit, so treatment may need to be repeated a few weeks after your first dose. Steroid medication can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of acute schistosomiasis, or symptoms caused by damage to the brain or nervous system. Preventing schistosomiasis There's no vaccine for schistosomiasis, so it's important to be aware of the risks and take precautions to avoid exposure to contaminated water. You can check whether the area you're visiting is known to have a problem with schistosomiasis using Travel Health Pro's country information section . If you're visiting one of these areas: avoid paddling, swimming and washing in fresh water – only swim in the sea or chlorinated swimming pools boil or filter water before drinking – as the parasites could burrow into your lips or mouth if you drink contaminated water avoid medicines sold locally that are advertised to treat or prevent schistosomiasis – these are often either fake, sub-standard, ineffective or not given at the correct dosage don't rely on assurances from hotels, tourist boards or similar that a particular stretch of water is safe – try to find out from an official or reliable source Quickly drying yourself with a towel after getting out of the water is not a reliable way of preventing infection, although it's a good idea to dry yourself as soon as possible if you're accidentally exposed to potentially contaminated water.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bird-flu/",
    "text": "Bird flu Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. In rare cases, it can affect humans. There are lots of different strains of bird flu virus. Most of them don't infect humans. But there are 4 strains that have caused concern in recent years: H5N1 (since 1997) H7N9 (since 2013) H5N6 (since 2014) H5N8 (since 2016) Although H5N1, H7N9 and H5N6 don't infect people easily and aren't usually spread from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. In February 2021 H5N8 was found to have infected a small number of people for the first time, in Russia. Bird flu in the UK Plans are in place to manage any suspected cases of bird flu in the UK. H5N8 and H5N1 bird flu have been found in some poultry, other captive birds and wild birds in the UK. H5N6 has also been found in some wild birds in the UK, but this is a different strain to the H5N6 virus that has infected some people in China. You can read the latest bird flu updates on GOV.UK . How bird flu spreads to humans Bird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird (dead or alive). This includes: touching infected birds touching droppings or bedding killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking Markets where live birds are sold can also be a source of bird flu. Avoid visiting these markets if you're travelling to countries that have had an outbreak of bird flu. You can check health advice for the country you're visiting on the TravelHealthPro website . You can't catch bird flu through eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak of bird flu. Things you can do to prevent bird flu If you're visiting a foreign country that's had an outbreak you should: wash your hands often with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling food, in particular raw poultry use different utensils for cooked and raw meat make sure meat is cooked until steaming hot avoid contact with live birds and poultry What not to do: do not go near or touch bird droppings or sick or dead birds do not go to live animal markets or poultry farms do not bring any live birds or poultry back to the UK, including feathers do not eat undercooked or raw poultry or duck do not eat raw eggs There is no bird flu vaccine The seasonal flu vaccine doesn't protect against bird flu. Symptoms of bird flu in humans The main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include: a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery aching muscles headache a cough or shortness of breath Other early symptoms may include: diarrhoea sickness stomach pain chest pain bleeding from the nose and gums conjunctivitis It usually takes 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after you've been infected. Within days of symptoms appearing, it's possible to develop more severe complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . Getting treatment quickly, using antiviral medicine, may prevent complications and reduce the risk of developing severe illness. When to seek medical advice Use NHS 111 online ( 111.nhs.uk ) or call NHS 111 if you experience any symptoms of bird flu and have visited an area affected by bird flu in the past 10 days. Your symptoms can be checked over the phone. If you're abroad Get medical help straight away if you get the symptoms of bird flu. Contact your travel insurance company if you need advice about where to get help. What a doctor can do Tell the doctor if you have: recently travelled to an area affected by bird flu and if you've been close (within 1 metre) to live or dead birds had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with anyone who has a severe respiratory illness had contact with anyone who died unexpectedly and was from an area that had an outbreak These tests can be done to confirm bird flu: a nose and throat swab to see if they contain the virus if you're coughing up phlegm this may be tested for the virus If the tests are normal, it's unlikely you have bird flu. Treatment for bird flu If it's thought you might have symptoms of bird flu you'll be advised to stay at home, or you'll be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients. You may be given an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). Antiviral medicines help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff. Reporting suspected cases of bird flu in birds If you suspect bird flu in poultry or other captive birds, you must report it immediately by calling: 03000 200 301 if you're in England 03003 038 268 if you're in Wales APHA Field Services if you're in Scotland Bird flu is a notifiable disease in poultry and other captive birds. If you do not report it, you’re breaking the law. Read more about notifiable diseases in animals from GOV.UK . Signs that a bird may be infected with bird flu include: sudden death swollen head closed and runny eyes Reporting dead wild birds can also help the authorities keep track of the spread of the disease.

    "text": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis) Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a poorly understood condition where you have pelvic pain and problems peeing. It's sometimes called interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome. It's difficult to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis) as there is no single test that confirms the condition. Symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) The main symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) include: intense pelvic pain (felt over your lower tummy) sudden strong urges to pee needing to pee more often than usual pain in your lower tummy when your bladder is filling up, which is relieved when you pee waking up several times during the night to pee Other symptoms can include finding it difficult to pee, urinary incontinence and blood in your urine (haematuria). These symptoms can sometimes be caused by other conditions, such as cancer of the bladder. This is why you'll need a range of tests to rule out other possible causes before BPS (interstitial cystitis) can be diagnosed. Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you have blood in your urine and pain in your lower tummy. Blood in your pee may be bright pink, red or dark brown. Who gets BPS (interstitial cystitis) Although BPS (interstitial cystitis) can affect people of all ages, it's much more common in women than men, usually over the age of 30. The symptoms will often come and go over time. There may be times lasting days, weeks or months where your symptoms improve, followed by flare-ups when they're worse. You might also find the pain is worse during your period or after having certain foods or drinks. It can have a big impact on your everyday life, including work, mental health and relationships. But when a diagnosis is confirmed there are different treatments that can help. What causes interstitial cystitis? The exact cause of BPS (interstitial cystitis) is not clear. However, there are several ideas about what might cause it. These include: damage to the bladder lining, which may mean pee can irritate the bladder and surrounding nerves a problem with the pelvic floor muscles used to control peeing your immune system causing an inflammatory reaction Some people who have been diagnosed with BPS (interstitial cystitis), may have a long-term (chronic) urinary infection (UTI) in the bladder, which has not been picked up by current urine tests. BPS (interstitial cystitis) may also be associated with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia , myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . When to see a GP See a GP if: you have pelvic pain that does not go away you notice a change in your usual peeing pattern and it is affecting your daily life Ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have blood in your pee. What happens when you see a GP BPS (interstitial cystitis) can have similar symptoms to long-term or frequent UTIs, so the GP may give you a urine test to check for a UTI. Standard urine tests used in GP surgeries and hospitals may not pick up all infections of the bladder. You may be prescribed antibiotics to see if they help. A GP may also suggest simple treatments such as: keeping a food diary and avoiding foods and drinks that make your symptoms worse stopping smoking – chemicals in tobacco can irritate your bladder When to ask a GP for referral to a hospital specialist Treatments from the GP may not always work. If your symptoms keep coming back or do not go away, ask the GP to refer you to a urologist specialising in female urology or a urogynaecologist. Men may be referred to a urologist. How is BPS (interstitial cystitis) diagnosed? There is no single test to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis). You may have several tests to exclude other causes of your symptoms before a diagnosis can be confirmed. The tests offered may include: cystoscopy – a procedure to look inside your bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope urine tests ultrasound , MRI scan or CT scan of the urinary tract and sometimes of the kidneys too urodynamics – a range of tests to check the function of your bladder and urethra vaginal swabs Ask your doctor to explain what tests you are being offered and what they're for. Treatments for BPS (interstitial cystitis) When you have been diagnosed by a specialist as having BPS (interstitial cystitis), there are several treatments that may help. No single treatment works for everyone, and there is no conclusive evidence they work. You may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the treatments offered to you and why. Medicines Tablets or capsules may be used to treat people with BPS (interstitial cystitis). These include: over-the-counter painkillers – such as paracetamol and ibuprofen medicines for nerve pain – such as amitriptyline , gabapentin and pregabalin tolterodine , solifenacin or mirabegron – these can reduce the urgency to pee a prescription medicine that may help by blocking the effect of a substance called histamine in the bladder pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) – this may reduce pain (this can only be prescribed by a specialist as it's only suitable for some people) Bladder instillations Some medicines can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter . These are known as intravesical medicines or bladder instillations. Examples of intravesical medicines include: lignocaine - a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder, a mixture of compounds including steroids, sodium bicarbonate and heparin are used hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate – this may help restore the bladder lining antibiotics alone or combined with a local anaesthetic and steroid – this can calm inflammation and reduce infection As with oral medicines, the evidence is not conclusive for bladder instillations. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the different options. Supportive therapies and treatments Some people may also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful: physiotherapy – a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist can help you relax your muscles to ease pain. acupuncture – may help with pain relief talking therapies and counselling – to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your life transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your body pain management – ask the GP to refer you to a pain specialist Surgery and procedures Surgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments do not work. Procedures that may be carried out include: cauterisation – ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laser bladder distension – the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve symptoms botulinum toxin injections (such as Botox) – injected directly into your bladder wall to temporarily relieve symptoms of frequent peeing and pain. neuromodulation – an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to pee In very rare cases, and only as a last resort, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy). If this is done, your surgeon may need to create an alternative way for pee to leave your body. Things you can do to help BPS (interstitial cystitis) Things that may help improve your symptoms include: reducing stress – try exercise, warm baths and mindfulness-based meditation techniques making sure you are hydrated regularly throughout the day keeping a food diary – if you notice certain foods or drinks (like citrus fruits and alcohol) make symptoms worse, avoid them, but ask for medical advice first stopping smoking – the chemicals in cigarettes can irritate your bladder Information: More information and support Bladder Health UK has information and forums on BPS (interstitial cystitis), as well as other bladder conditions Page last reviewed: 18 February 2022 Next review due: 18 February 2025"

    "text": "Overview - Bladder stones Contents Overview Causes Treatment Bladder stones are hard lumps of minerals that can form inside the bladder when it's not completely empty of urine. They may not cause any symptoms if they're small enough to be passed out of the bladder when you pee. But most people with bladder stones do experience symptoms because the stones either irritate the wall of the bladder or block the flow of urine. Typical symptoms of bladder stones include: lower abdominal pain, which can often be severe (men may also have pain in or around their penis) pain or difficulty when peeing peeing more frequently (particularly at night) cloudy or dark-coloured urine blood in the urine Most cases of bladder stones affect men aged 50 or older because of the link with prostate enlargement. But both men and women can get bladder stones. It's rare for bladder stones to affect children. In children, they can lead to bedwetting , and some boys may experience priapism , a persistent and often painful erection that can last for hours. When to see your GP See your GP if you experience any of the above symptoms, particularly if you have persistent abdominal pain, need to pee more frequently, or have blood in your urine. These symptoms may not necessarily be caused by bladder stones, but need to be investigated further. If your GP suspects you have a stone in your bladder, you'll be referred to hospital for testing. A blood and a urine test will probably be carried out first. A blood test will detect if there's an infection inside your bladder. The next stage is to take an X-ray of your bladder. Not all types of bladder stones show up clearly on X-rays, so a negative X-ray result doesn't always mean that you don't have bladder stones. An ultrasound scan may be used instead of an X-ray. Bladder stones can also be identified using a cystoscopy . This is where a thin fibreoptic tube with a light and a camera at one end (a cystoscope) is inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) and moved up into the bladder. The camera relays images to a screen, where they can be seen by the urologist (specialist in treating bladder conditions). What causes bladder stones? Bladder stones usually form when you can't completely empty your bladder of urine. A common reason for this in men is having an enlarged prostate gland that blocks the flow of urine. If urine sits in the bladder for a long time, chemicals in the urine form crystals, which harden into bladder stones. Read more about the causes of bladder stones and who's at risk. Treating bladder stones Surgery is usually needed to remove the stones from the bladder. The most common procedure is a cystolitholapaxy, where a thin tube (cystoscope) with a camera at the end is used to find the bladder stones. The cystoscope will then use stone-crushing devices, lasers or ultrasound to break up the stones before they're removed. Where possible, it's important to treat the underlying causes of bladder stones to prevent new stones developing in the future. Read more about treating bladder stones . Preventing bladder stones If you have had bladder stones, they can come back. There are things you can do to try to prevent this happening. You can try to: increase your daily fluid intake to 2 to 3 litres to lower the concentration of your urine regularly empty your bladder without delaying urinate again 10 to 20 seconds after your first attempt (if you're unable to empty your bladder completely first time); this is called double voiding and helps empty the bladder more efficiently avoid constipation (regular laxatives may be recommended) The bladder and kidneys The kidneys filter waste products out of the blood, which are mixed with water to create urine. Urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder, where it's stored. When the bladder is full and you're ready to pee, urine passes out of your body through a tube called the urethra.

    "text": "Blindness and vision loss In the UK, more than 2 million people are living with sight loss. Of these, around 340,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted. Being told you have a visual impairment that can't be treated can be difficult to come to terms with. Some people go through a process similar to bereavement, where they experience a range of emotions including shock, anger, and denial, before eventually coming to accept their condition. Specialist referral If you're blind or partially sighted, you may be referred to a specialist low-vision clinic, which is often located within a hospital. Staff at the clinic can help you understand your condition and come to terms with your diagnosis. They can also advise you about practical things, such as lighting and vision aids, and let you know about further sources of help and support. Ask your local hospital if they have an Eye Clinic Liaison Officer (ECLO), whose role involves providing support to people with vision loss in eye clinics. Support groups If you're blind or partially sighted, you may find it helpful to contact a support group for people with vision loss. Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) The RNIB is the UK's leading charity for people with vision loss. The RNIB website offers useful information, such as coming to terms with sight loss . The RNIB's helpline is open Monday to Friday from 8am to 8pm and Saturday from 9am to 1pm. The number is 0303 123 9999, with calls costing no more than a standard rate call to an 01 or 02 number. You can also email helpline staff ( helpline@rnib.org.uk ). The RNIB's website is specially designed for people with sight loss and provides a wide range of useful information and resources, including an online community and RNIB online shop . Other national charities Other national charities that specialise in vision loss and you may find useful include: The Macular Society – helpline: 0300 303 0111 Glaucoma UK – helpline: 01233 648170 or email helpline@glaucoma.uk Retina UK – helpline: 0300 111 4000 or email: helpline@retinauk.org.uk Diabetes UK – 0345 123 2399 or email: info@diabetes.org.uk Blind Veterans UK – 0800 389 7979 Royal Society for Blind Children SeeAbility Thomas Pocklington Trust Local organisations There are also many local voluntary organisations around the country that help and support people with vision problems. You can find local support organisations on the RNIB's Sightline Directory . Registering as blind or partially sighted If your vision has deteriorated to a certain level, you may choose to register as visually impaired. Depending on the severity of your vision loss you'll either be registered as sight impaired (previously \"partially sighted\") or severely sight impaired (previously \"blind\"). Your eye specialist (ophthalmologist) will measure your ability to see detail at a distance (visual acuity) and how much you can see from the side of your eye when looking straight ahead (your field of vision). These measurements will help your ophthalmologist determine whether you're eligible to be certified as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. If you are, they will complete an official certificate with the results of your eye examination. In England and Wales this certificate is called the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI), in Scotland it's called the CVI (Scotland) form, and in Northern Ireland it's called an A655. Your ophthalmologist will send a copy of the certificate to you, a copy to your GP and a copy to your local social services department. Upon receiving the certificate, your local social services team will contact you to ask whether you want to be added to its register of visually impaired people. If you say \"yes\" then you become registered. After you're registered, social services will contact you again to arrange for an assessment to be carried out. The aim is to assess your needs and find out what help you require to remain independent, such as help with cleaning and cooking, or help with mobility and transport. Registering as visually impaired isn't compulsory, but it can help you to get a range of benefits, including: benefits to help with any costs relating to your disability or illness a reduction in the TV licence fee help with NHS costs help with Council Tax and tax allowances reduced fees on public transport parking concessions Find out more: RNIB: registering as sight impaired GOV.UK: registering vision impairment as a disability Changes to your home Most visually impaired people can continue to live at home. However, you'll probably need to make some changes to your home, particularly if you live on your own. Below is a list of some important pieces of equipment you may find useful. Big-button telephone – both landline and mobile phones are available from the RNIB online shop . Computer, smartphone or tablet – the internet can provide a real sense of connection to friends and family as well as other people with a visual impairment. It's also a practical way of finding out information and obtaining goods and services. Big-button keyboards, screen display software and text readers are available from the RNIB. Community alarm – this small, wearable device has an alarm button which, if pressed, sends an alarm signal to a response centre, which will alert a nominated friend or carer. Your local authority should be able to provide you with further information. Bright lighting – bright light bulbs and adjustable lights are essential for your home, particularly in the kitchen and the stairs (areas where you're most likely to have an accident). Lighting in and around the home: A guide to better lighting for people with visual impairment by the Thomas Pocklington Trust , contains more information on the importance of lighting. The way your house is painted can also make it easier to find your way around. Using a two-tone contrast approach, such as black and white, can make it easier to tell the difference between nearby objects, such as a door and its handle or the stairs and its handrail. Read more from the RNIB about adapting your home Reading and writing There are several options available if you're having problems reading standard text in books, newspapers and magazines. One of the simplest options is to use a magnifying device that can make print appear bigger to help you read. These can be obtained from a number of places including hospital low-vision services, optometrists, local voluntary organisations, and the RNIB. The RNIB also has a collection of large-print publications you can borrow, as do most libraries. You could also use an e-reader to help you read. E-readers are handheld devices that allow you to download books and subscribe to newspapers and magazines on the internet. You can choose a setting that allows you to display text at a larger size. Or you can use text-to-speech software. The RNIB has more information on text-to-speech in eBooks If you're unable to read at all you could listen to audio recordings. You can sign up to the: RNIB's Newsagent scheme, which provides more than 200 magazine and newspaper titles in different formats, such as online or on CD. RNIB Talking Books Service , where you can download audio books to listen to on your smartphone, tablet or computer or on a device known as a DAISY player. You can also get books on CD or USB stick, delivered to your door. You can also install screen-reading software on your computer that will read out emails, documents and text on the internet. The RNIB has more information about using screen-reading software There are also voice recognition programmes where you speak into a microphone and the software translates what you say into writing. These programmes can also be used to issue commands, such as closing down the internet and moving from one website to another. Braille Some people with severe sight loss, particularly those who've had the problem from a young age, choose to learn Braille. Braille is a writing system where raised dots are used as a substitute for written letters. As well as Braille versions of books and magazines, you can buy Braille display units, which can be attached to computers that allow you to read the text displayed on a computer screen. Braille computer keyboards are also available. The RNIB website has more information about reading and Braille Getting around There are several different methods you can use to get around independently if you have a problem with your vision. Long cane You may find a long cane useful when travelling. These canes are usually foldable and can help you get around by detecting objects in your path. The cane will also make drivers and other pedestrians aware that you have sight loss. To get the most from a long cane, it's a good idea to attend a training course that will teach you how to use it. The charity Guide Dogs has more information about getting around safely with a long cane Guide dogs Guide Dogs has been providing guide dogs for people with vision loss for many years. Guide dogs can help you get around, and provide both a sense of independence and companionship. If you apply for a guide dog, Guide Dogs provide all the essential equipment free of charge and can also offer financial assistance if needed for things like food or vet costs. You don't need to have lost all your sight to benefit from a guide dog and you don't have to be officially registered as blind or partially sighted to apply for one. Guide Dogs has more on applying for a guide dog Guide Dogs also offer a number of other services for people with a visual impairment (even if you don't have a guide dog), such as Help for children and families and mobility training. The Guide Dogs' Sighted guiding service aims to reduce the isolation that many people with sight loss experience, helping to rebuild their confidence and regain their independence. Global positioning system (GPS) A global positioning system (GPS) is a navigational aid that uses signals from satellites to tell you where you are and help plan your journeys. GPS devices are available as standalone units that can be programmed using a Braille keyboard, which tell you your current location and give you directions to where you want to go. If you have a smartphone, there are a number of GPS apps you can download. The RNIB website has more information about using GPS Driving If you're diagnosed with a condition that affects your vision, you have a legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Failure to do so is a crime and can result in a fine of up to £1,000. GOV.UK has more on driving with a disability or a health condition If you're registered as having a sight impairment, the DVLA will assume your driving licence is no longer valid and you'll no longer be able to drive. Exceptions are occasionally made for people with mild vision impairment. If you think this applies to you, then your doctor will need to fill in a DVLA medical information questionnaire . You're only legally allowed to drive if you can read a number plate from a distance of 20 metres (65 feet), and an eye test shows your visual acuity is at least 6/12. You're allowed to wear glasses or contact lenses when reading the plate or letter chart. There are also standards relating to your visual field and driving. If you have a condition that may reduce your visual field, the DVLA may ask you to complete a visual field test to demonstrate you're safe to drive. Technology Technology to help you live well and safely with sight loss is developing all the time. You can read: the RNIB's information on technology and useful products the Guide Dogs' information on technology for visual impairment Employment If you're currently employed and have recently been diagnosed with a visual impairment, you should contact the GOV.UK: Access to Work scheme. Access to Work is a scheme run by Jobcentre Plus that provides advice and support about what equipment and adjustments may be required to enable you to do your job. They also offer a grant to contribute towards the costs of any equipment or training you may need, such as voice recognition software, a Braille keyboard and display unit and a printer that can convert text into Braille (Braille embossers). Depending on the size of the company you work for, the grant can pay for 80% to 100% of costs, up to £10,000. Find out more: RNIB: equality, rights and employment GOV.UK: Jobcentre Plus The Thomas Pocklington Trust: employment You don't have to disclose that you have a visual impairment when applying for a job, but it's usually recommended that you do. If you feel you've been turned down for a job because of your disability, and you were capable of doing the job, you can make a complaint under the Equality Act 2010 . Some people with a visual impairment decide to become self-employed, often because it allows them the flexibility to work at home for hours they choose. The RNIB website has more information and advice about equality, rights and employment Regular sight tests If you have vision loss, it's still important to have regular sight tests so your optometrist (eye specialist) can check for further changes in your eyes and give you advice about how to make the best use of your vision.

Do soak a clean cloth in warm water and hold it against the boil for 10 minutes 4 times a day clean the area around the boil with antibacterial soap if pus comes out cover the area with a dressing or gauze until it heals bathe or shower every day and wash your hands regularly take paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain wash your towels and bedding at least once a week at high temperature try to lose weight if you are very overweight and have boils between folds of your skin Don’t do not pick, squeeze or pierce a boil do not share your towel with other people until the boil has gone do not go to a swimming pool or gym until the boil has gone –⁠ you could pass the infection on to others Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you've had a boil for 2 weeks and the things you've tried are not helping you keep getting boils you have a group of boils (carbuncle) Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you have a boil and: it is on your face the skin around your boil feels hot, painful and swollen you feel hot and shivery you have a weakened immune system – this could be from taking treatments such as steroids, or having a condition like diabetes You can call 111 or get help from NHS 111 online . Treatment for boils A GP can check if you need treatment. You may need: a small procedure to drain the boil to get rid of the pus antibiotics Causes of boils You may be more likely to get boils if you have a long-term condition that affects your immune system, such as diabetes or HIV. You may also be more likely to get boils if: you're a man you've been in close contact with someone with boils you have certain skin conditions, such as eczema you take certain medicines, such as steroids you’re living with obesity or malnutrition Carbuncles are less common and mostly affect middle-aged men.

They're not usually serious, but they sometimes need to be treated with surgery. Symptoms of a bone cyst Symptoms of a bone cyst can include: pain, swelling or a lump, usually in your arm, leg or spine numbness or tingling, if the cyst affects your spine a break (fracture), sometimes from a relatively minor injury Bone cysts do not always cause symptoms. Sometimes they're found after they cause a fracture, or if you have an X-ray for another reason. Treatments for bone cysts If the bone cyst is small A bone cyst may not need treatment if it's small and not causing any problems. They often get better on their own, especially in children and teenagers. You may have regular X-rays for a few years to check your bone is healing and the cyst is not getting bigger. If the bone cyst is large or causing problems A bone cyst might need to be treated if it's: large or getting bigger – this could make the bone weaker and more likely to break (fracture) if you injure it causing problems like pain, swelling or a lump The main treatments are: draining the fluid with a needle and injecting medicine into the bone to help it heal – this may need to be done several times over a few months cutting or scraping out the cyst – the hole may be filled with small pieces of bone taken from another part of your body or from a donor, or with a bone cement mixture Treatment is done under general anaesthetic. You will not usually need to stay in hospital overnight. Recovering after treatment for a bone cyst If you have treatment for a bone cyst it normally takes at least a few months for the bone to heal. You may need to avoid activities or sports that could damage the bone until it has healed. You'll have regular X-rays for a few years to check it's getting better. It's quite common for bone cysts to come back, especially in the first couple of years after treatment. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you get a lump, pain or swelling after treatment for a bone cyst This could mean the cyst has come back or you've developed an infection from surgery. Causes of bone cysts The exact cause of bone cysts is unknown. They're not cancer and do not spread to other parts of the body. The main types of cyst are thought to have different causes: unicameral bone cysts – fluid-filled holes that may form if fluid does not drain properly from a bone as it's growing aneurysmal bone cysts – blood-filled holes that may be caused by a problem with the blood vessels in a bone (possibly due to an injury or a non-cancerous growth) Page last reviewed: 21 July 2023 Next review due: 21 July 2026"

    "title": "Botulism",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/botulism/",
    "text": "Botulism Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. These toxins attack the nervous system (nerves, brain and spinal cord) and cause paralysis (muscle weakness). Most people will make a full recovery with treatment, but the paralysis can spread to the muscles that control breathing if it is not treated quickly. This is fatal in around 5 to 10% of cases. Symptoms of botulism The time it takes to develop symptoms can vary from a few hours to several days after exposure to the Clostridium botulinum bacteria or their toxins. Depending on the exact type of botulism, some people initially have symptoms such as feeling sick, being sick (vomiting), stomach cramps, diarrhoea or constipation . Without treatment, botulism eventually causes paralysis that spreads down the body from the head to the legs. Symptoms can include: drooping eyelids blurred or double vision facial muscle weakness difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) slurred speech breathing difficulties Affected babies may also have a weak cry, find it difficult to feed, and have a floppy head, neck and limbs. When to get medical advice Botulism is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. Go to your nearest A&E department or immediately dial 999 if you or someone you know has symptoms of botulism. Treatment is more effective the earlier it's started. Causes and types of botulism Clostridium botulinum bacteria are found in soil, dust and river or sea sediments. The bacteria themselves are not harmful, but they can produce highly poisonous toxins when deprived of oxygen, such as in closed cans or bottles, stagnant soil or mud, or occasionally, the human body. There are 3 main types of botulism: food-borne botulism – when someone eats food containing the toxins because it has not been properly canned, preserved or cooked wound botulism – when a wound becomes infected with the bacteria, usually as a result of injecting illegal drugs like heroin contaminated with the bacteria into muscle rather than a vein infant botulism – when a baby swallows a resistant form of the bacteria, called a spore, in contaminated soil or food, such as honey (these spores are harmless to older children and adults because the body develops defences against them from about the age of 1) All these types of botulism are rare in the UK, but occasional cases do occur. Treatment for botulism Botulism needs to be treated in hospital. The way it's treated depends on the type of botulism, but usually involves: neutralising the toxins with injections of special antitoxins or antibodies supporting the functions of the body, such as breathing, until you recover Treatment will not immediately reverse any paralysis that's already been caused by the toxin, but will stop it getting any worse. In most people, paralysis that occurred before treatment will gradually improve over the following weeks or months. Preventing botulism Food-borne botulism As a result of high standards of food hygiene in the UK, the chances of getting food-borne botulism from food bought in this country are low. There's a slightly higher risk if you produce your own food, particularly if this involves canning. But following food hygiene procedures and canning recommendations will reduce any risk. Do not eat food from bulging or damaged cans, and avoid eating foul-smelling preserved foods, foods stored at the incorrect temperature and out-of-date foods. Infant botulism In many cases of infant botulism, the specific cause is not identified so it may not always be possible to prevent it. But you should avoid giving honey to babies under the age of 1 as it's been known to contain Clostridium botulinum spores. Wound botulism People who inject heroin can get botulism. This is often through injecting heroin, contaminated with the bacteria, into the skin or muscles. The best way to avoid getting botulism is to stop using heroin. Find out more about how to get help for heroin addiction. GOV.UK has more information about how to reduce your risk of getting botulism if you do inject heroin Page last reviewed: 03 October 2022 Next review due: 03 October 2025"

    "text": "Bowel polyps Bowel polyps are small growths on the lining of the large intestine (colon) or rectum. They're very common and not usually serious, but sometimes they can lead to bowel cancer. Bowel polyps are also called colonic or colorectal polyps. Symptoms of bowel polyps Bowel polyps do not usually cause any symptoms, so most people with polyps will not know they have them. They are often found during a colonoscopy , for example if you're being checked for another bowel condition, like bowel inflammation or cancer. Rarely, larger polyps can cause symptoms such as: a small amount of slime (mucus) or blood in your poo bleeding from your bottom a change in your normal bowel habits, such as diarrhoea or constipation losing weight without trying Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have slime (mucus) or blood in your poo for 3 weeks or more your bowel habit is different to normal you are constipated and it's not improving with treatment, or it happens regularly and lasts a long time you've lost a noticeable amount of weight without trying Try not to be embarrassed. The doctor or nurse will be used to talking about these symptoms. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you've had diarrhoea for more than 7 days your poo is black or dark red you have bloody diarrhoea You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Go to A&E or call 999 if: you're bleeding non-stop from your bottom there's a lot of blood – for example, the toilet water turns red or you see large blood clots Find your nearest A&E Bowel polyps and bowel cancer Polyps are usually harmless and do not become cancerous. But in a small number of cases a polyp can become cancerous over many years. Bowel cancer screening can help find polyps that are more likely to develop into bowel cancer. These polyps are then removed. Find out more about bowel cancer Diagnosing bowel polyps If your GP thinks your symptoms could be caused by bowel polyps, they may recommend a colonoscopy or a CT colonography. Colonoscopy A colonoscopy is where a long, thin flexible tube with a small camera at the end (a colonoscope) is passed into your bottom and guided up into your bowel to look for polyps. A colonoscopy should not be painful, but can feel uncomfortable. CT colonography A CT colonography scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a detailed image of your bowel and show any polyps. You'll be given special liquid before the scan so that your bowel can be seen clearly. Cancer Research UK has more information about CT colonography Treatment for bowel polyps Bowel polyps are usually removed while having a colonoscopy. A wire loop that is part of the colonoscope will cut off (snare) or burn off (cauterise) the polyp. This is called a polypectomy and is painless. Rarely, when there are lots of polyps or a polyp is very large, surgery may be needed to remove part of the bowel. After treatment After the polyp or polyps have been removed, they're sent to a lab to check if: the polyp has been completely removed there's any risk of it regrowing there's any cancerous changes in the polyp If there are cancerous changes in the polyp, you may need further treatment. Your specialist will advise you about this. Causes of bowel polyps The exact cause of bowel polyps is not known. It's thought they're caused by the body producing too many cells in the lining of the bowel. These extra cells then form into a bump, which is the polyp. You may be more likely to develop bowel polyps if: a member of your family has had bowel polyps or bowel cancer you're over 50 (around 1 in 4 people over 50 will have at least 1 polyp) you have inflammatory bowel disease, which includes ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease you're overweight or smoke Page last reviewed: 28 July 2023 Next review due: 28 July 2026"

    "text": "Bowen's disease Bowen's disease is a very early form of skin cancer that's easily treatable. The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin. It affects the squamous cells, which are in the outer layer of skin, and is sometimes referred to as squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The patch is usually very slow growing, but there's a small chance it could turn into a more serious type of skin cancer if left untreated. The most effective method of reducing your risk of Bowen's disease, as well as other more serious types of skin cancer, is to limit your exposure to the sun. Get more advice about sunscreen and sun safety Is Bowen's disease serious? Bowen's disease itself is not usually serious. It tends to grow very slowly over months or years, and there are several very effective treatments for it. The concern is that Bowen's disease can eventually develop into a different type of skin cancer called squamous cell skin cancer if it's left undiagnosed or neglected. It's estimated this happens in up to 1 in 20 to 1 in 30 people with untreated Bowen's disease. Squamous cell skin cancer is often treatable, but it can spread deeper into the body and is sometimes very serious. Symptoms of Bowen's disease Bowen's disease usually appears as a patch on the skin that has clear edges and does not heal. Some people have more than 1 patch. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/251721/view The patch may be: scaly or crusty flat or raised up to a few centimetres across itchy (but not all the time) red or pink on white skin, but this may be harder to see on brown and black skin The patch can appear anywhere on the skin, but is especially common on exposed areas like the lower legs, neck and head. Sometimes they can affect the groin area and, in men, the penis. If the patch bleeds, starts to turn into an open sore (ulcer) or develops a lump, it could be a sign it's turned into squamous cell skin cancer. When to get medical advice See a GP if you have a persistent red or scaly patch of skin and do not know the cause. It's important to get a proper diagnosis, as Bowen's disease can look like other conditions, such as psoriasis or eczema . If necessary, your GP will refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) to determine what the problem is. If they are not sure about the cause, they may need to remove a small sample of skin so it can be looked at more closely (a biopsy ). Causes of Bowen's disease Bowen's disease usually affects people in their 60s and 70s. The exact cause is unclear, but it's been closely linked with: long-term exposure to the sun or use of sunbeds – especially in people with fair skin having a weak immune system – for example, it's more common in people taking medicine to suppress their immune system after an organ transplant, or those with AIDS previously having radiotherapy treatment the human papillomavirus (HPV) – a common virus that often affects the genital area and can cause genital warts Bowen's disease does not run in families and it's not infectious. Treatments for Bowen's disease There are a number of treatment options for Bowen's disease. Talk to your dermatologist about which treatment is most suitable for you. The main treatments are: cryotherapy – liquid nitrogen is sprayed on to the affected skin to freeze it. The procedure may be painful and the skin may remain a bit uncomfortable for a few days. The affected skin will scab over and fall off within a few weeks. imiquimod cream or chemotherapy cream (such as 5-fluorouracil) – this is applied to the affected skin regularly for a few weeks. It may cause your skin to become red and inflamed before it gets better. curettage and cautery – the affected area of skin is scraped away under local anaesthetic , where the skin is numbed, and heat or electricity is used to stop any bleeding, leaving the area to scab over and heal after a few weeks. photodynamic therapy (PDT) – a light-sensitive cream is applied to the affected skin and a laser is directed on to the skin a few hours later to destroy the abnormal cells. The treatment session usually lasts between 8 to 45 minutes. You may need more than 1 session. surgery – the abnormal skin is cut out under local anaesthetic and stitches may be needed afterwards. In some cases, your dermatologist may just advise monitoring your skin closely – for example, if it's very slow growing and they feel the side effects of treatment will outweigh the benefits. Looking after your skin after treatment After having treatment for Bowen's disease, you may need follow-up appointments with your dermatologist or GP to see if you need any further treatment. If you had surgery, you may need to have any stitches removed at your GP surgery 5 to 14 days later or once your wound has healed. Sometimes dissolvable stitches are used that do not need to be removed. If you had a dressing on your wound, you may need to go to your GP or the hospital to have it changed. After treatment: see a GP if an existing patch starts to bleed, change in appearance or develops a lump – do not wait for your follow-up appointment see a GP if you notice any new patches on your skin make sure you protect your skin from the sun – wear protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 Get more advice on sunscreen and sun safety Page last reviewed: 06 October 2022 Next review due: 06 October 2025"

    "title": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/interstitial-cystitis/",
    "text": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis) Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a poorly understood condition where you have pelvic pain and problems peeing. It's sometimes called interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome. It's difficult to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis) as there is no single test that confirms the condition. Symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) The main symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) include: intense pelvic pain (felt over your lower tummy) sudden strong urges to pee needing to pee more often than usual pain in your lower tummy when your bladder is filling up, which is relieved when you pee waking up several times during the night to pee Other symptoms can include finding it difficult to pee, urinary incontinence and blood in your urine (haematuria). These symptoms can sometimes be caused by other conditions, such as cancer of the bladder. This is why you'll need a range of tests to rule out other possible causes before BPS (interstitial cystitis) can be diagnosed. Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you have blood in your urine and pain in your lower tummy. Blood in your pee may be bright pink, red or dark brown. Who gets BPS (interstitial cystitis) Although BPS (interstitial cystitis) can affect people of all ages, it's much more common in women than men, usually over the age of 30. The symptoms will often come and go over time. There may be times lasting days, weeks or months where your symptoms improve, followed by flare-ups when they're worse. You might also find the pain is worse during your period or after having certain foods or drinks. It can have a big impact on your everyday life, including work, mental health and relationships. But when a diagnosis is confirmed there are different treatments that can help. What causes interstitial cystitis? The exact cause of BPS (interstitial cystitis) is not clear. However, there are several ideas about what might cause it. These include: damage to the bladder lining, which may mean pee can irritate the bladder and surrounding nerves a problem with the pelvic floor muscles used to control peeing your immune system causing an inflammatory reaction Some people who have been diagnosed with BPS (interstitial cystitis), may have a long-term (chronic) urinary infection (UTI) in the bladder, which has not been picked up by current urine tests. BPS (interstitial cystitis) may also be associated with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia , myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . When to see a GP See a GP if: you have pelvic pain that does not go away you notice a change in your usual peeing pattern and it is affecting your daily life Ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have blood in your pee. What happens when you see a GP BPS (interstitial cystitis) can have similar symptoms to long-term or frequent UTIs, so the GP may give you a urine test to check for a UTI. Standard urine tests used in GP surgeries and hospitals may not pick up all infections of the bladder. You may be prescribed antibiotics to see if they help. A GP may also suggest simple treatments such as: keeping a food diary and avoiding foods and drinks that make your symptoms worse stopping smoking – chemicals in tobacco can irritate your bladder When to ask a GP for referral to a hospital specialist Treatments from the GP may not always work. If your symptoms keep coming back or do not go away, ask the GP to refer you to a urologist specialising in female urology or a urogynaecologist. Men may be referred to a urologist. How is BPS (interstitial cystitis) diagnosed? There is no single test to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis). You may have several tests to exclude other causes of your symptoms before a diagnosis can be confirmed. The tests offered may include: cystoscopy – a procedure to look inside your bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope urine tests ultrasound , MRI scan or CT scan of the urinary tract and sometimes of the kidneys too urodynamics – a range of tests to check the function of your bladder and urethra vaginal swabs Ask your doctor to explain what tests you are being offered and what they're for. Treatments for BPS (interstitial cystitis) When you have been diagnosed by a specialist as having BPS (interstitial cystitis), there are several treatments that may help. No single treatment works for everyone, and there is no conclusive evidence they work. You may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the treatments offered to you and why. Medicines Tablets or capsules may be used to treat people with BPS (interstitial cystitis). These include: over-the-counter painkillers – such as paracetamol and ibuprofen medicines for nerve pain – such as amitriptyline , gabapentin and pregabalin tolterodine , solifenacin or mirabegron – these can reduce the urgency to pee a prescription medicine that may help by blocking the effect of a substance called histamine in the bladder pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) – this may reduce pain (this can only be prescribed by a specialist as it's only suitable for some people) Bladder instillations Some medicines can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter . These are known as intravesical medicines or bladder instillations. Examples of intravesical medicines include: lignocaine - a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder, a mixture of compounds including steroids, sodium bicarbonate and heparin are used hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate – this may help restore the bladder lining antibiotics alone or combined with a local anaesthetic and steroid – this can calm inflammation and reduce infection As with oral medicines, the evidence is not conclusive for bladder instillations. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the different options. Supportive therapies and treatments Some people may also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful: physiotherapy – a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist can help you relax your muscles to ease pain. acupuncture – may help with pain relief talking therapies and counselling – to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your life transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your body pain management – ask the GP to refer you to a pain specialist Surgery and procedures Surgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments do not work. Procedures that may be carried out include: cauterisation – ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laser bladder distension – the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve symptoms botulinum toxin injections (such as Botox) – injected directly into your bladder wall to temporarily relieve symptoms of frequent peeing and pain. neuromodulation – an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to pee In very rare cases, and only as a last resort, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy). If this is done, your surgeon may need to create an alternative way for pee to leave your body. Things you can do to help BPS (interstitial cystitis) Things that may help improve your symptoms include: reducing stress – try exercise, warm baths and mindfulness-based meditation techniques making sure you are hydrated regularly throughout the day keeping a food diary – if you notice certain foods or drinks (like citrus fruits and alcohol) make symptoms worse, avoid them, but ask for medical advice first stopping smoking – the chemicals in cigarettes can irritate your bladder Information: More information and support Bladder Health UK has information and forums on BPS (interstitial cystitis), as well as other bladder conditions Page last reviewed: 18 February 2022 Next review due: 18 February 2025"

    "text": "Plagiocephaly and brachycephaly (flat head syndrome) Babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they're a few months old, usually as a result of them spending a lot of time lying on their back. This is known as flat head syndrome, and there are 2 main types: plagiocephaly – the head is flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical; the ears may be misaligned and the head looks like a parallelogram when seen from above, and sometimes the forehead and face may bulge a little on the flat side brachycephaly – the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen, and occasionally the forehead bulges out Credit: Created by NHSD (Annabel King) These problems are quite common, affecting around 1 in every 5 babies at some point. In most cases they are not a major cause for concern, as they do not have any effect on the brain and the head shape will often improve by itself over time. Your baby will not experience any pain or other symptoms, or any problems with their general development. What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly? The skull is made up of plates of bone that strengthen and join together as a child gets older. A young baby's skull is still relatively soft and can change shape if there's constant pressure on a particular part of their head. Reasons why this may happen include: sleeping on their back – the back or side of a baby's head can become flattened as a result of always sleeping on their back, but it's important they do this to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) problems in the womb – pressure can be placed on a baby's head before they're born if they're a bit squashed in the womb or there's a lack of amniotic fluid to cushion them being born prematurely – premature babies are more likely to develop a flattened head because their skull is softer when they're born, and they may prefer to rest their head on one side at first as they're not yet able to move their head themselves neck muscle tightness – this can prevent a baby turning their head a particular way, meaning one side of their head is placed under more pressure Occasionally, a flattened head can be caused by the plates of the skull joining together too early. This is known as craniosynostosis . When to get medical advice Speak to your health visitor or GP if you're concerned about the shape of your baby's head or think they may have problems turning their head. They can examine your baby's head and suggest things you can do to help. A slightly flattened head is not usually anything to worry about, but it's a good idea to get advice early on so you can take steps to stop it getting any worse. What you can do The shape of your baby's head should improve naturally over time as their skull develops and they start moving their head, rolling around and crawling. To take pressure off the flattened part of your baby's head: give your baby time on their tummy during the day – encourage them to try new positions during play time, but make sure they always sleep on their back as this is safest for them switch your baby between a sloping chair, a sling and a flat surface – this ensures there is not constant pressure on one part of their head change the position of toys and mobiles in their cot – this will encourage your baby to turn their head on to the non-flattened side alternate the side you hold your baby when feeding and carrying reduce the time your baby spends lying on a firm flat surface, such as car seats and prams – try using a sling or front carrier when practical If your baby has difficulty turning their head, physiotherapy may help loosen and strengthen their neck muscles. Corrective surgery may be needed if they have craniosynostosis. Find out more about how craniosynostosis is treated Helmets, headbands and mattresses There are specially designed helmets and headbands that some people claim can help improve the shape of a baby's skull as they grow. These devices apply pressure to \"bulging\" parts of the skull and relieve pressure from other parts, potentially allowing growth in the flatter areas. Treatment is started when the child's skull is still soft, usually at around 5 or 6 months old, and the device is worn almost continuously (up to 23 hours a day) for several months. But these helmets and headbands generally are not recommended because: there is not clear evidence to suggest they work they often cause problems such as skin irritation and rashes they're expensive, typically costing around £2,000 your baby will need to be checked every few weeks to monitor their head growth and make any necessary adjustments they may be uncomfortable and distressing for your baby Some people try special curved mattresses that are designed to distribute the weight of a baby's head over a larger area so less pressure is placed on a particular point of their skull. These are cheaper than helmets and headbands, but there's currently only limited evidence to suggest they may help. Will my child's head shape return to normal? Mild flattening of the head will usually improve if you use the simple measures described on this page, although it may be a couple of months before you start to notice an improvement. Your baby's head may not return to a completely perfect shape, but by the time they're 1 or 2 years old any flattening will be barely noticeable. More severe cases will also get better over time, although some flattening will usually remain. The appearance of your child's head should improve as they become more mobile and their hair grows. It's very rare for a child to experience problems such as teasing when they reach school age. You may consider using a helmet or headband if you're worried about your child, but it's not clear whether these always work. You should also bear in mind the inconvenience, expense and possible discomfort for you and your child. Page last reviewed: 03 August 2022 Next review due: 03 August 2025"

    "text": "Overview - Brain abscess Contents Overview Causes Treatment A brain abscess is a pus-filled swelling in the brain. It usually occurs when bacteria or fungi enter the brain tissue after an infection or severe head injury. Although the risk of developing a brain abscess is extremely low in England, it is a life-threatening condition and should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Symptoms of a brain abscess The symptoms of a brain abscess may develop quickly or slowly but can include: headache – which is often severe, located in a single section of the head and cannot be relieved with painkillers changes in mental state – such as confusion or irritability problems with nerve function – such as muscle weakness, slurred speech or paralysis on one side of the body a high temperature seizures (fits) feeling sick being sick stiff neck changes in vision – such as blurring, greying of vision or double vision (due to the abscess putting pressure on the optic nerve) When to get medical advice Any symptoms that suggest a problem with the brain and nervous system should be treated as a medical emergency. These include: slurred speech muscle weakness or paralysis seizures occurring in a person with no previous history of seizures If you or someone you know experiences any of these symptoms, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Any symptoms that suggest a worsening infection, such as a high temperature or being sick, should be reported to your GP immediately. If your GP is not available, contact your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 . Causes of a brain abscess There are 3 main ways a brain abscess can develop. These are: an infection in another part of the skull – such as an ear infection , sinusitis or dental abscess , which can spread directly into the brain an infection in another part of the body – for example, the infection that causes pneumonia spreading into the brain via the blood trauma, such as a head injury – that cracks open the skull, allowing bacteria or fungi to enter the brain However, in some cases, the source of the infection remains unknown. Read more about the causes of a brain abscess . Diagnosing a brain abscess If a brain abscess is suspected, an initial assessment will be made based on your symptoms, medical history and whether you've had a recent infection or a weakened immune system. Blood tests can also be carried out to check for an infection. If you're referred to hospital for further tests, you may have either: a CT scan – a series of X-rays are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body an MRI scan – which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body. If an abscess is found, a procedure known as CT-guided aspiration may be used to remove a sample of pus for testing. This involves using a CT scan to guide a needle to the site of the abscess. Treating a brain abscess A brain abscess is regarded as a medical emergency. Swelling caused by the abscess can disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. There's also a risk of the abscess bursting (rupturing). If left untreated, a brain abscess can cause permanent brain damage and could be fatal. A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of: medicines – either antibiotics or antifungals surgery – either draining the pus through a hole in the skull (simple aspiration) or opening the skull and removing the abscess entirely (craniotomy) Treatment with antibiotics often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed, to reduce the risk of complications. Read more about treating a brain abscess . Complications of a brain abscess Complications of a brain abscess can include: a reoccurring abscess – seek immediate medical advice if you think there's even a small chance your abscess has reoccurred; this is more common in people with a weakened immune system or cyanotic heart disease brain damage – mild to moderate brain damage often improves with time but severe brain damage is likely to be permanent; brain damage is more of a risk if diagnosis and treatment are delayed epilepsy – where a person has repeated seizures (fits) meningitis – a life-threatening infection of the protective membranes around the brain, which requires urgent treatment; this is more common in children Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022 Next review due: 18 October 2025 Next : Causes"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/brain-aneurysm/",
    "text": "Overview - Brain aneurysm Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, usually where it branches. As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the blood pressure causes a small area to bulge outwards like a balloon. Aneurysms can develop in any blood vessel in the body, but the 2 most common places are: the artery that transports blood away from the heart to the rest of the body (the abdominal aorta) the brain This topic is about brain aneurysms. There's a separate topic about abdominal aortic aneurysm . About brain aneurysms The medical term for an aneurysm that develops inside the brain is an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm. Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they burst (rupture). This leads to an extremely serious condition known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage , where bleeding caused by the ruptured aneurysm can cause extensive brain damage and symptoms. Symptoms of a burst brain aneurysm include: a sudden agonising headache – it's been described as a \"thunderclap headache\", similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before a stiff neck sickness and vomiting pain on looking at light Find out more about the symptoms of a brain aneurysm A ruptured brain aneurysm is a medical emergency. If you think someone has had a brain haemorrhage, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. How brain aneurysms are treated If a brain aneurysm is detected before it ruptures, treatment may be recommended to prevent it rupturing in future. Most aneurysms do not rupture, so treatment is only carried out if the risk of a rupture is particularly high. Factors that affect whether treatment is recommended include your age, the size and position of the aneurysm, your family medical history, and any other health conditions you have. If treatment is recommended, this usually involves either filling the aneurysm with tiny metal coils (coiling) or an open operation to seal it shut with a tiny metal clip (surgical clipping). The same techniques used to prevent ruptures are also used to treat brain aneurysms that have already ruptured. If your risk of a rupture is low, you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your aneurysm. You may also be given medicine to reduce your blood pressure and advice about ways you can reduce your chances of a rupture, such as stopping smoking if you smoke. Why brain aneurysms develop Exactly what causes the wall of affected blood vessels to weaken is still unclear, although risk factors have been identified. These include: smoking high blood pressure a family history of brain aneurysms In some cases, an aneurysm may develop because there was a weakness in the walls of the blood vessels at birth. Who's affected It's difficult to estimate exactly how many people are affected by brain aneurysms because they usually cause no symptoms and pass undetected. Some experts believe it could be as high as 1 in 20 people, while others think the figure is much lower at around 1 in 100 people. The number of aneurysms that actually rupture is much smaller. Only around 1 in 15,000 people have a ruptured brain aneurysm in England each year. Brain aneurysms can develop in anyone at any age, but are more common in people over the age of 40. Women tend to be affected more commonly than men. Preventing brain aneurysms The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid activities that could damage your blood vessels. Things to avoid include: smoking eating a high-fat diet not controlling high blood pressure being overweight or obese Find out more about preventing aneurysms Page last reviewed: 11 April 2022 Next review due: 11 April 2025 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Overview - Brain death Contents Overview Diagnosis Brain death (also known as brain stem death) is when a person on an artificial life support machine no longer has any brain functions. This means they will not regain consciousness or be able to breathe without support. A person who is brain dead is legally confirmed as dead. They have no chance of recovery because their body is unable to survive without artificial life support. Brain death is legal death If someone is brain dead, the damage is irreversible and, according to UK law, the person has died. It can be confusing to be told someone has brain death, because their life support machine will keep their heart beating and their chest will still rise and fall with every breath from the ventilator. But they will not ever regain consciousness or start breathing on their own again. They have already died. The brain stem The brain stem is the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column). The brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body's automatic functions that are essential for life. These include: breathing heartbeat blood pressure swallowing The brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain's core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement. After brain death, it is not possible for someone to remain conscious. Causes of brain death Brain death can happen when the blood or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by: cardiac arrest – when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen a heart attack – when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked a stroke – when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted a blood clot – a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body Brain death can also be caused by: a severe head injury a brain haemorrhage infections, such as encephalitis a brain tumour Brain death is different from a vegetative state The difference between brain death and a vegetative state (a disorder of consciousness ), which can happen after extensive brain damage, is that it's possible to recover from a vegetative state, but brain death is permanent. Someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means: some form of consciousness may exist breathing unaided is usually possible there's a slim chance of recovery because the brain stem's core functions may be unaffected Someone in a vegetative state is awake but shows no signs of awareness. For example, they may open their eyes but not respond to their surroundings. In rare cases, a person in a vegetative state may show some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings. Tests to confirm brain death Although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead. These include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe hypothermia . A number of tests are carried out to check for brain death, such as shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light. Find out more about diagnosing brain death Organ donation After brain death, it may be possible for the person's organs to be used in transplants, which can often save the lives of others. In cases where a deceased person has not made their wishes clear, deciding whether to donate their organs can be a difficult decision for partners and relatives. Hospital staff are aware of these difficulties and will try to ensure the issue is handled sensitively and thoughtfully.

    "text": "Overview - Subarachnoid haemorrhage Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Recovery A subarachnoid haemorrhage is an uncommon type of stroke caused by bleeding on the surface of the brain. It's a very serious condition and can be fatal. Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage There are usually no warning signs, but a subarachnoid haemorrhage sometimes happens during physical effort or straining, such as coughing, going to the toilet, lifting something heavy or having sex. The main symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage include: a sudden severe headache unlike anything you’ve experienced before a stiff neck feeling and being sick sensitivity to light (photophobia) blurred or double vision stroke-like symptoms – such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking) A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone in your care has these symptoms. How a subarachnoid haemorrhage is treated A person with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage needs a CT scan in hospital to check for signs of bleeding around the brain. If a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed or strongly suspected, you're likely to be transferred to a specialist neurosciences unit. Medicine will usually be given to help prevent short-term complications, and a procedure to repair the source of the bleeding may be carried out. Read more about: diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage treating a subarachnoid haemorrhage Causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages Subarachnoid haemorrhages are often caused by a burst blood vessel in the brain (a ruptured brain aneurysm ). It's not known exactly why brain aneurysms develop in some people. But certain risk factors have been identified, including: smoking high blood pressure excessive alcohol consumption Severe head injuries can cause subarachnoid bleeding, but this is a separate problem known as a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. Read more about the causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages . Who's affected? Subarachnoid haemorrhages can happen at any age, but are most common in people aged between 45 and 70. Slightly more women are affected than men. Subarachnoid haemorrhages are also more common in black people compared to other ethnic groups. This could be because black people are more likely to have high blood pressure. Reducing your risk There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. The most effective steps you can take to reduce your chances of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage are: stop smoking – your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service for help and advice, or you can call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 moderate your alcohol units (alcohol consumption) take steps to prevent high blood pressure – such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and losing weight if you're overweight Possible complications A subarachnoid haemorrhage can cause both short and long-term complications. Serious short-term complications can include further bleeding at the site of any aneurysm and brain damage caused by a reduction in blood supply to the brain. Long-term complications include: epilepsy – where a person has repeated seizures (fits) problems with certain mental functions, such as memory, planning and concentration changes in mood, such as depression Read more about the complications of a subarachnoid haemorrhage . Outlook Although the outlook for subarachnoid haemorrhage has improved in the last few decades, it can be fatal, and people who survive can be left with long-term problems. Recovering after a subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be a slow and frustrating process, and it's common to have problems such as: extreme tiredness headaches problems sleeping Read more about recovering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage .

    "text": "Brain tumours A brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way. Grades and types of brain tumour Brain tumours are graded according to how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. Grade 1 and 2 tumours are low grade, and grade 3 and 4 tumours are high grade. There are 2 main types of brain tumours: non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours – these are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment cancerous (malignant) brain tumours – these are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they're more likely to grow back after treatment The Cancer Research UK website has more information about specific types of brain tumours . Symptoms of a brain tumour The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain affected. Common symptoms include: headaches seizures (fits) persistently feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and drowsiness mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body vision or speech problems Sometimes you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may develop very slowly over time. When to see a GP See a GP if you have these types of symptoms, particularly if you have a headache that feels different from the type of headache you usually get, or if headaches are getting worse. You may not have a brain tumour, but these types of symptoms should be checked. If the GP cannot identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a doctor who specialises in the brain and nervous system (neurologist) for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan. Who's affected Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. More than 12,000 people are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour in the UK each year, of which about half are cancerous. Many others are diagnosed with a secondary brain tumour. Causes and risks The cause of most brain tumours is unknown, but there are several risk factors that may increase your chances of developing a brain tumour. Risk factors include: age – the risk of getting a brain tumour increases with age (most brain tumours happen in older adults aged 85 to 89), although some types of brain tumour are more common in children radiation – exposure to radiation accounts for a very small number of brain tumours; some types of brain tumours are more common in people who have had radiotherapy , or very rarely, CT scans or X-rays of the head family history and genetic conditions – some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of getting a brain tumour, including tuberous sclerosis , neurofibromatosis type 1 , neurofibromatosis type 2 and Turner syndrome GOV.UK has more information about safety of medical radiation. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of brain tumours . Treating brain tumours If you have a brain tumour, your treatment will depend on: the type of tumour where it is in your brain how big it is and how far it's spread how abnormal the cells are your overall health and fitness Treatments for brain tumours include: steroids medicines to help with symptoms surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy After being diagnosed with a brain tumour, steroids may be prescribed to help reduce swelling around the tumour. Other medicines can be used to help with other symptoms of brain tumours, such as anti-epileptic medicines for seizures and painkillers for headaches. Surgery is often used to remove brain tumours. The aim is to remove as much abnormal tissue as safely as possible. It's not always possible to remove all of a tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be needed to treat any abnormal cells left behind. Treatment for non-cancerous tumours is often successful and a full recovery is possible. Sometimes there's a small chance the tumour could return, so you may need regular follow-up appointments to monitor this. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about treatment for brain tumours . Outlook If you have a brain tumour, your outlook will depend on several factors, including: your age the type of tumour you have where it is in your brain how effective the treatment is your general health Survival rates are difficult to predict because brain tumours are uncommon and there are many different types. Your doctor will be able to give you more information about your outlook. Generally, around 17 out of every 100 people with a cancerous brain tumour will survive for 5 years or more after being diagnosed.

    "text": "Non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours A brain tumour is where cells in the brain grow in an uncontrolled way. Non-cancerous tumours (also called low-grade or benign tumours) usually grow slowly and are less likely to spread than cancerous tumours. Information: There is separate information about cancerous (malignant) brain tumours . Symptoms of a brain tumour The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on which part of the brain is affected. As non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly, the symptoms usually come on gradually and may get worse slowly over months or years. Symptoms of a brain tumour can include: headaches that get worse over time or do not go away – although it's unusual for a headache to be the only symptom seizures (fits) feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) feeling sleepy or dizzy changes in your eyesight, such as blurred or double vision changes in behaviour or personality, such as confusion or problems with memory and concentration problems with speech, movement and balance Brain tumours can affect people of any age. They're more common in older adults, but some types can affect young adults or children. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you keep getting headaches, they do not go away or they're getting worse you have headaches that wake you up at night or are worse in the morning you have any other symptoms of a brain tumour that do not go away Get help from 111 online or call 111. Call 111 for a child under 5 years old. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you have a headache that came on suddenly and is extremely painful someone has a seizure (fit) for the first time Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. What happens at your GP appointment If you have symptoms of a brain tumour or another problem affecting the brain, a GP may do some simple tests to check things like your eyesight, balance and memory. If there are signs of a possible problem, they may refer you for a brain scan or to a brain specialist (neurologist) for more tests. Being referred for tests does not mean anything is seriously wrong. Tests to check for a brain tumour The main test to check for a tumour is a brain scan (usually an MRI scan ). This can show if you have a possible tumour, but you'll usually need more tests to confirm it. Most people have a procedure to remove a small sample of cells for testing. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy can show what type of tumour you have and how fast it's likely to grow (called the \"grade\"). Brain tumours are given a grade from 1 to 4. Grades 1 and 2 are generally considered to be non-cancerous (low-grade or benign) because they grow more slowly. Important: Driving You must tell the DVLA if you have a brain tumour. You may not be allowed to drive until after the tumour has been treated. This depends on the type of tumour you have, where it is in the brain and what symptoms you have.

Each type affects a different part of the brain. Some types of brain tumour can be either non-cancerous or cancerous. Some types are only non-cancerous. Common types of non-cancerous brain tumour Type Area affected Meningioma The thin layer of tissue covering the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Glioma The cells that support and protect the nerve cells in the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Acoustic neuroma The nerve connecting the brain to the inner ear Pituitary adenoma A pea-sized gland in the brain that produces hormones (pituitary gland) Information: Find out more The Brain Tumour Charity: adult brain tumour types The Brain Tumour Charity: child brain tumour types Treatment for non-cancerous brain tumours Non-cancerous brain tumours are usually treatable. Your treatment depends on the type of tumour it is, where it is in your brain and any symptoms you have. You may not need treatment straight away because non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly. You might just have regular check-ups and scans to monitor it. If treatment is needed, the main treatment is surgery to remove the tumour. This usually involves cutting out a small piece of skull so the surgeon can remove the tumour. The piece is then fixed back in place and the cut in your skin is closed with stitches. Some people may need other treatments, such as: radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill the tumour cells) chemotherapy (where medicines are used to kill the tumour cells) treatment for any symptoms caused by the tumour (for example, medicines for nausea, seizures or pain) Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: treatment for brain tumours The Brain Tumour Charity: neurosurgery for brain tumours Recovering from a non-cancerous brain tumour Most non-cancerous brain tumours can be successfully treated, but it can take a while to recover from the effects of a tumour and any treatment you had.

    "text": "Breast abscess A breast abscess is a painful build-up of pus in the breast caused by an infection. It mainly affects women who are breastfeeding. It's not usually serious, but it needs treatment in hospital. Symptoms of a breast abscess Symptoms of a breast abscess may include: a lump or swelling in your breast pain in your breast, it may also feel warm or look red (this may be harder to see on brown or black skin) a high temperature feeling generally unwell You’re more likely to have a breast abscess if you have recently had a breast infection (mastitis) or if you’ve had a breast abscess before. If you're not sure it's a breast abscess Other conditions can make your breast sore and swollen: breast pain breast pain when breastfeeding breast lumps Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you have: a painful, warm or red breast a lump or swelling in your breast You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at your GP appointment for a breast abscess If the GP thinks you have a breast abscess, they will refer you to hospital for an ultrasound scan of your breast to check for an abscess. The GP may give you antibiotics first if they think you have a breast infection. Important Go back to the GP if your symptoms do not start to improve within 2 days of starting antibiotics. Treatment for a breast abscess You’ll need to go to hospital to have treatment for a breast abscess. Treatment involves the pus being drained from the abscess with either: a needle – this might need to be done a few times and you may have to go back to hospital each time a small cut in your skin You'll be given a local anaesthetic before the pus is drained so you do not feel any pain. You can usually go home the same day and may be given antibiotics to take at home. The abscess should heal completely in a few days or weeks. Breastfeeding during treatment Continue feeding with both breasts if you can. This will not harm your baby and can help your breast heal. Try expressing milk from your breasts with your hand or a breast pump if breastfeeding is too painful. Causes of a breast abscess A breast abscess can form if you have a breast infection (called mastitis ) and it's not treated quickly. You're more likely to get mastitis if you are breastfeeding.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breath-holding-in-babies-and-children/",
    "text": "Breath-holding in babies and children Breath-holding is when a baby or child stops breathing for up to 1 minute and may faint. It can happen when a child is frightened, upset, angry, or has a sudden shock or pain. It's usually harmless but can be scary for parents, particularly when it happens for the first time. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your child faints and cannot be woken up your child is stiff, shaking or jerking (this may be a fit) your child’s lips, tongue, face or skin suddenly turn pale, blue or grey (on black or brown skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet) These could be symptoms of breath-holding, but could also be related to other, more serious conditions. If a doctor has not previously told you it's breath-holding, it's important to get it checked immediately. What happens during breath-holding During breath-holding, your child may: cry and then be silent while holding their breath open their mouth as if going to cry but make no sound turn pale, blue or grey be floppy or stiff, or their body may jerk faint for 1 or 2 minutes Your child may be sleepy or confused for a short while afterwards. Breath-holding is usually harmless Breath-holding can be scary for parents, but it's usually harmless and your child should grow out of it by the age of 4 or 5. Breath-holding episodes: usually last for less than 1 minute (if the child faints, they'll usually regain consciousness within 1 or 2 minutes) are not epileptic seizures Your child is not holding their breath on purpose and cannot control what happens when they have a breath-holding episode. What to do when a child has a breath-holding episode There are some things you can do when a child has a breath-holding episode. Do stay calm – it should pass in less than 1 minute lie the child on their side – do not pick them up stay with them until the episode ends make sure they cannot hit their head, arms or legs on anything act normally after an episode, reassure them and ensure they get plenty of rest Don’t do not shake your child or splash them with water do not put anything in their mouth (including your fingers) do not give them mouth-to-mouth or CPR do not tell them off (they're not doing it deliberately) Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: Your child has already been diagnosed with breath-holding and: has episodes more often than before or they seem worse their breath-holding episodes are affecting everyday life The GP will try to find out if there's a more serious underlying condition. They may suggest your child has an ECG to check their heart rhythm. Treatments for breath-holding There's no specific treatment for breath-holding. It should eventually stop by the time your child is 4 or 5 years old. Medicines are rarely used to treat breath-holding. Breath-holding is sometimes related to iron deficiency anaemia . Your child's blood iron levels may be checked. They may need iron supplements if their iron levels are low. Causes of breath-holding Breath-holding is not something a child does deliberately. It's usually triggered by a sudden shock or pain, or strong emotions like fear, upset or anger. There are 2 types of breath-holding: blue breath-holding spells – this is the most common type of breath-holding and happens when a child's breathing pattern changes reflex anoxic seizures – this type of breath-holding happens when a child's heart rate slows down Information: Find out more Syncope Trust And Reflex anoxic Seizures (STARS): reflex anoxic seizures Page last reviewed: 02 March 2023 Next review due: 02 March 2026"

    "text": "Bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious. Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis , which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages. Symptoms of bronchiolitis The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C. A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as: breathing more quickly finding it difficult to feed or eat noisy breathing (wheezing) becoming irritable Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs there are pauses when your child breathes your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if: your child has had a cold and it's getting worse your child is feeding or eating much less than normal your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty your child is very tired or irritable Treatments for bronchiolitis There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home. But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital. Do give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16 try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice Don’t do not smoke around your child do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes Preventing bronchiolitis There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as: wash your hands and your child's hands often wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly avoid sharing things like cutlery and cups use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they were born prematurely or have serious health conditions It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis. RSV vaccination The RSV vaccine helps reduce the risk of a common infection called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causing serious problems such as bronchiolitis. The vaccine is available on the NHS from 28 weeks of pregnancy. This will help protect your baby for the first few months after they're born. It's also offered to adults aged 75 to 79. Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis. This includes children who: were born very prematurely have a heart or lung condition have a weakened immune system These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis. Causes of bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) . RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children get it at least once before they're 2 years old. It's not usually serious, but some babies and children have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis, particularly: babies under 6 months old babies and children who were born prematurely babies and children with a weakened immune system, or long-term lung or heart conditions Page last reviewed: 13 April 2022 Next review due: 13 April 2025"

    "text": "Brugada syndrome Brugada syndrome is a rare heart condition that's usually inherited. It can affect your heart rhythm and can be life-threatening, but there are things you can do to reduce the risk of serious problems. Symptoms of Brugada syndrome Brugada syndrome does not usually cause any symptoms. Sometimes it's found when you have an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason. If you do get symptoms they can include: fainting or blackouts feeling dizzy or lightheaded heart palpitations seizures or fits shortness of breath Symptoms usually start in adulthood, but it can happen at any age. Brugada syndrome can also cause a dangerously fast or irregular heartbeat. This can lead to a cardiac arrest, where your heart beats so fast that not enough blood gets to your brain, so you become unconscious and stop breathing. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: someone's not breathing normally and not moving or responding – they could be having a cardiac arrest someone's having a seizure or fit someone's fainted or had a blackout and cannot be woken up within 1 minute Follow the instructions from the 999 operator until an ambulance arrives. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You've been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome or you're worried you have it and: you've fainted or had a blackout and have now recovered you have dizziness that does not go away or keeps coming back you have heart palpitations that keep coming back, last longer than a few minutes or are getting worse you've had a seizure or fit and have now recovered Also ask for an urgent GP appointment if your parent, child, brother or sister has been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, or died unexpectedly (you may also need tests to check your heart). You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Tests for Brugada syndrome If a GP thinks you could have Brugada syndrome or another heart condition they'll refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist). You'll have tests such as: an electrocardiogram (ECG) , where sensors are put on your chest to check your heart a provocation test, where you're given a medicine while having an ECG As Brugada syndrome is usually inherited, you may also be offered genetic testing to see if you have genes linked to the condition. Important If you're diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, your immediate family should also be offered testing as there's a chance they could also have the condition. Treatments for Brugada syndrome If you have Brugada syndrome but you've not had any symptoms, you will not usually need any medical treatment. Most people with the condition have a low risk of serious problems. You'll be monitored regularly to check the health of your heart. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) Doctors may recommend that you're fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This is a small device that's put under your skin in your chest, in a similar way to a pacemaker . It monitors your heart rhythm and sends an electrical shock to your heart when it's needed to correct the rhythm. You'll only need an ICD if either: you've had symptoms such as a cardiac arrest, heart palpitations or fainting doctors think you're at high risk of getting a dangerous heart rhythm based on your electrocardiogram (ECG) results How to reduce the risk of heart rhythm problems if you have Brugada syndrome If you have Brugada syndrome it's important to avoid triggers that can cause problems with your heart rhythm.

Symptoms of bullous pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid usually starts with an itchy, raised rash on the skin, usually the backs of the knees, insides of the armpits and elbows, hands, feet or tummy. The sore, itchy patches look red or pink on white skin and dark reddish-brown on brown or black skin. Credit: DR P.

MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/260961/view Some people may also get blisters in their mouth, which can cause problems swallowing (dysphagia) . Not everyone gets blisters. If you do, they may keep coming and going for months or years. Bullous pemphigoid eventually goes away on its own. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have an itchy rash that does not go away in a few weeks you have lots of blisters or big, painful blisters you have blisters that keep coming back you have blisters in your mouth and are finding it difficult to swallow your skin is painful, hot and swollen – the skin might also be red if it's an infection, but this may be less obvious on brown on black skin a blister is filled with pus or blood Treatment for bullous pemphigoid If a GP thinks you have bullous pemphigoid, they may refer you to a specialist for tests and treatment. The main treatments for bullous pemphigoid are: steroid creams steroid tablets antibiotics Treatment can help your skin heal, stop new patches or blisters appearing, and lower the chances of your skin getting infected. Your skin should eventually heal without scarring, but it might be a bit darker than it was before. Important Do not burst your blisters yourself unless you have been shown how to by a nurse. Your skin might get infected. Complications of bullous pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid can sometimes cause serious problems and may be life threatening to people at higher risk of complications. The main risks are: skin infections, which can be very serious if they get deeper into your body ( sepsis ) side effects of steroid treatment, such as high blood pressure, weakened bones and a higher chance of getting infections Steroids will be used as little as possible, and at the lowest possible dose, to help avoid side effects. It's important to go to check-ups with your doctor so problems can be found and treated early. Causes of bullous pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid is caused by a problem with the immune system, the body's defence against infection. Instead of attacking germs, it attacks and damages the skin. It's not always clear why this happens, although certain things may trigger it. These include: certain medicines sunburn surgery burns Page last reviewed: 06 February 2025 Next review due: 06 February 2028"

Straightening your toe bone. Fixing your toe bone in place with metal screws or staples put under your skin. These are often left in permanently. Surgery is usually done when you're asleep under general anaesthetic . But sometimes it may be done under local anaesthetic (where you're awake but feel no pain). Most people go home the same day. It can take a while to recover from bunion surgery. You'll usually need to: rest and keep your feet raised as much as possible for at least 2 weeks avoid driving for 6 to 8 weeks stay off work for 2 to 12 weeks avoid sports for 3 to 6 months After the operation: your toes might be weaker or stiffer than before your toes may not be perfectly straight your feet may still be painful Bunions sometimes come back after surgery. Information: Self-refer to a podiatrist If you have bunions, you might be able to refer yourself directly to a podiatrist without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS podiatrists near you How to prevent bunions The cause of bunions is not always known, but you may be more likely to get them if you wear shoes that do not fit properly.

    "text": "Overview - Burns and scalds Contents Overview Treatment Recovery Complications Prevention Burns and scalds are damage to the skin usually caused by heat. Both are treated in the same way. A burn is caused by dry heat – by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam. Credit: SCOTT CAMAZINE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/98607/view Burns can be very painful and may cause: red or peeling skin blisters swelling white or charred skin The amount of pain you feel is not always related to how serious the burn is. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless. Treating burns and scalds To treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below: immediately get the person away from the heat source to stop the burning remove any clothing or jewellery that's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies, but do not move anything that's stuck to the skin cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 to 30 minutes – do not use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter make sure the person keeps warm by using a blanket, for example, but take care not to rub it against the burnt area after cooling the burn, cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it – a clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your hand use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain raise the affected area if possible – this helps to reduce swelling if it's an acid or chemical burn , dial 999 , carefully try to remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing, and rinse the affected area using as much clean water as possible Read more about treating burns and scalds . When to get medical attention Depending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home. For minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form. More serious burns require professional medical attention. You should go to a hospital A&E department for: all chemical and electrical burns large or deep burns – any burn bigger than the injured person's hand burns that cause white or charred skin – any size burns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitals If someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention. Some symptoms may be delayed and can include: coughing a sore throat difficulty breathing facial burns People at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under 10 years old, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald. The size and depth of the burn will be assessed, and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied. In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended. Read more about: recovering from burns and scalds complications of burns and scalds Types of burn Burns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected. Your skin has 3 layers: the epidermis – the outer layer of skin the dermis – the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair follicles the subcutaneous fat, or subcutis – the deeper layer of fat and tissue There are 4 main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms: superficial epidermal burn – where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blistered superficial dermal burn – where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blisters deep dermal or partial thickness burn – where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painless full thickness burn – where all 3 layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy. It may also be painless Preventing burns and scalds Many severe burns and scalds affect babies and young children. Examples of things you can do to help reduce the likelihood of your child having a serious accident at home include: keeping your child out of the kitchen whenever possible testing the temperature of bath water using your elbow before you put your baby or toddler in the bath keeping matches, lighters and lit candles out of young children's sight and reach keeping hot drinks well away from young children Read more about preventing burns and scalds .

Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. How to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning There are some things you can do to reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Do get a carbon monoxide alarm for each room of your home that contains appliances that burn gas, oil, coal or wood get heating and cooking appliances properly installed and keep them well maintained make sure your boiler is serviced regularly by a qualified engineer keep chimneys and flues clean and well maintained Don’t do not use a barbeque or camping stove indoors, or inside a tent do not leave vehicles or other engines on inside garages Treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning You may need to be checked in hospital if you have carbon monoxide poisoning, especially if: you have symptoms of severe carbon monoxide poisoning (for example, you have difficulty breathing or you lost consciousness) you are pregnant you are a child or older person you have anaemia or a condition affecting your lungs, heart or blood vessels While you are in hospital, you will usually have tests to check the level of carbon monoxide in your blood. If the level is high, you may be given oxygen through a mask. Page last reviewed: 01 July 2022 Next review due: 01 July 2025"

    "text": "Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy is a general term for diseases of the heart muscle, where the walls of the heart chambers have become stretched, thickened or stiff. This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Most types of cardiomyopathy are inherited. It can also be caused by other conditions, or risk factors, but for some people the cause is unknown. Cardiomyopathy can affect people of all ages. Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart become stretched and thin, so they cannot squeeze (contract) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you're at greater risk of heart failure , where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure . There's also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You'll need to have regular appointments with a GP so the condition can be monitored. Who's affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults. The following can all play a role in the condition: inheriting a changed (mutated) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the condition an underlying medical condition uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle, such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in your diet, drinking too much alcohol and using recreational drugs a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle a heart valve problem a disease of the tissues or blood vessels – such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) , sarcoidosis , amyloidosis , lupus , polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy pregnancy – peripartum cardiomyopathy is rare and sometimes develops during pregnancy, or within 3 months of the baby's birth But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation and Cardiomyopathy UK's information on life with dilated cardiomyopathy . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells enlarge and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The heart chambers are reduced in size so they cannot hold much blood, and the walls cannot relax properly and may stiffen. Also, the flow of blood through the heart may be obstructed. How serious is it? In most cases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will not have an impact on daily life. Some people do not have any symptoms and do not need treatment. But that does not mean the condition cannot be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation) . Blood flow from the heart may be reduced or restricted (called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Find out more about mitral valve problems . You'll also be at greater risk of developing a heart infection ( endocarditis ). These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and recommend lifestyle changes you can make. Who's affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. More information Read the British Heart Foundation and Cardiomyopathy UK's information on life with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare. It's most often diagnosed in children, although it can develop at any age. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiff and rigid and cannot relax properly after contracting. This means the heart cannot fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure , such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes the condition can be inherited. More information Find out more about restrictive cardiomyopathy from Cardiomyopathy UK . Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited condition that affects the left or right ventricles, or both. It's sometimes called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARCVM). In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), the proteins that usually hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous scar tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched and cannot pump blood around the body properly. People with ACM usually have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure . It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise makes the symptoms of ACM worse. It's important that people with or at risk of ACM discuss this in detail with their heart specialist (cardiologist). More information Find out more about ACM from Cardiomyopathy UK . Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as: electrocardiogram (ECG) echocardiogram MRI scan heart rhythm monitor (24 or 48-hour ECG monitor) exercise tests a detailed family tree drawn by specialists may be required for the diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy If you've been diagnosed with an inherited type of cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the faulty gene (mutation) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy There's usually no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments can be effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Some types of cardiomyopathy have specific treatments and early diagnosis is very important. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the condition they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes Whether the cause of cardiomyopathy is genetic or not, it should generally help to: eat a healthy diet and do gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol get plenty of sleep (as well as diagnose and treat any underlying sleep apnoea ) manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled Medicines Medicines may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots. Find out more about: treatments for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medicines to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart (septum) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart – this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy – heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have arrhythmia ablation. This treatment carefully alters the diseased heart tissue that causes the heart rhythm problems. Or they may have a device implanted, such as: a pacemaker to regulate the heart rate an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to prevent a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm Find out more about having a pacemaker implanted . Find out more about implantable cardioverter defibrillators from the British Heart Foundation . As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Broken heart syndrome Some people who experience significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during a period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack. Always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition – known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy – is more common in women. It's temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again. Find out more about Takotsubo cardiomyopathy on Cardiomyopathy UK . Page last reviewed: 25 May 2023 Next review due: 25 May 2026"

    "title": "Cardiovascular disease",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cardiovascular-disease/",
    "text": "Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels. It's usually associated with a build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) and an increased risk of blood clots . It can also be associated with damage to arteries in organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and eyes. CVD is one of the main causes of death and disability in the UK, but it can often largely be prevented by leading a healthy lifestyle. Types of CVD There are many different types of CVD. 4 of the main types are described on this page. Coronary heart disease Coronary heart disease occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle is blocked or reduced. This puts an increased strain on the heart, and can lead to: angina – chest pain caused by restricted blood flow to the heart muscle heart attacks – where the blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly Read more about coronary heart disease . Strokes and TIAs A stroke is where the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, which can cause brain damage and possibly death. A transient ischaemic attack (also called a TIA or \"mini-stroke\") is similar, but the blood flow to the brain is only temporarily disrupted. The main symptoms of a stroke or TIA can be remembered with the word FAST, which stands for: Face – the face may have drooped on one side, the person may be unable to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped. Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm. Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, they may not be able to talk at all or they may not be able to understand what you are saying to them. Time – it's time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms. Read more about stroke and TIAs . Peripheral arterial disease Peripheral arterial disease occurs when there's a blockage in the arteries to the limbs, usually the legs. This can cause: dull or cramping leg pain, which is worse when walking and gets better with rest hair loss on the legs and feet numbness or weakness in the legs persistent ulcers (open sores) on the feet and legs Read more about peripheral arterial disease . Aortic disease Aortic diseases are a group of conditions affecting the aorta. This is the largest blood vessel in the body, which carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. One of most common aortic diseases is an aortic aneurysm, where the aorta becomes weakened and bulges outwards. This doesn't usually have any symptoms, but there's a chance it could burst and cause life-threatening bleeding. Read more about aortic aneurysm . Causes of CVD The exact cause of CVD isn't clear, but there are lots of things that can increase your risk of getting it. These are called \"risk factors\". The more risk factors you have, the greater your chances of developing CVD. If you're over 40, you'll be invited by your GP for an NHS Health Check every 5 years. Part of this check involves assessing your individual CVD risk and advising you how to reduce it if necessary. High blood pressure High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important risk factors for CVD. If your blood pressure is too high, it can damage your blood vessels. Read more about high blood pressure . Smoking Smoking and other tobacco use is also a significant risk factor for CVD. The harmful substances in tobacco can damage and narrow your blood vessels. High cholesterol Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the blood. If you have high cholesterol, it can cause your blood vessels to narrow and increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Read more about high cholesterol . Diabetes Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels, making them more likely to become narrowed. Many people with type 2 diabetes are also overweight or obese, which is also a risk factor for CVD. Kidney disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should. People with chronic kidney disease have an increased risk of developing other serious problems, including CVD. Inactivity If you don't exercise regularly, it's more likely that you'll have high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and be overweight. All of these are risk factors for CVD. Exercising regularly will help keep your heart healthy. When combined with a healthy diet, exercise can also help you maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for CVD. You're at an increased risk of CVD if: your body mass index (BMI) is 25 or above, or 23 or above if you are from an Asian, Black African, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern ethnic background – use the BMI healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI your waist measurement is more than half your height – this NHS video on YouTube explains how to measure your waist and work out if it’s more than half your height Read more about obesity . Family history of CVD If you have a family history of CVD, your risk of developing it is also increased. You're considered to have a family history of CVD if you have a parent, brother or sister who had angina or a heart attack before the age of 60. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a family history of CVD. They may suggest checking your blood pressure and cholesterol level. Ethnic background In the UK people of south Asian and Black African or African Caribbean background have an increased risk of getting CVD. This is because people from these backgrounds are more likely to have other risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Other risk factors Other factors that affect your risk of developing CVD include: age – CVD is most common in people over 50 and your risk of developing it increases as you get older gender – men are more likely to develop CVD at an earlier age than women diet – an unhealthy diet can lead to high cholesterol and high blood pressure alcohol – excessive alcohol consumption can also increase your cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and contribute to weight gain Preventing CVD A healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of CVD. If you already have CVD, staying as healthy as possible can reduce the chances of it getting worse. Stop smoking If you smoke, you should try to give up as soon as possible. The NHS Better Health website can provide information, support and advice to help. Your GP can also provide you with advice and support. They can also prescribe medication to help you quit. Read more about stopping smoking . Have a balanced diet A healthy, balanced diet is recommended for a healthy heart. A balanced diet includes: low levels of saturated fat – try to include healthier sources of fat, such as oily fish, nuts and seeds, and olive oil, and avoid unhealthy fats such as fatty cuts of meat, lard, cream, cakes and biscuits low levels of salt – aim for less than 6g (0.2oz or 1 teaspoon) a day low levels of sugar plenty of fibre and wholegrain foods plenty of fruit and vegetables – eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day Read more about healthy eating . Exercise regularly Adults are advised to do at least 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, such as cycling or brisk walking. If you find it difficult to do this, start at a level you feel comfortable with and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your activity as your fitness improves. Visit your GP for a health check if you haven't exercised before or you're returning to exercise after a long break. Read advice about starting exercise . Maintain a healthy weight If you're overweight or obese, a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you lose weight. If you're struggling to lose weight, your GP or practice nurse can help you come up with a weight loss plan and recommend services in your area. Read more about losing weight and how your GP can help . Cut down on alcohol If you drink alcohol, try not to exceed the recommended limit of 14 alcohol units a week for men and women. If you do drink this much, you should aim to spread your drinking over 3 days or more. A unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units. Your GP can give you help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down your drinking. Medicine If you have a particularly high risk of developing CVD due to high blood cholesterol, your GP may recommend taking medicines called statins to reduce your risk.

    "text": "Carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is pressure on a nerve in your wrist. It causes tingling, numbness and pain in your hand and fingers. You can often treat it yourself, but it can take months to get better. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include: an ache or pain in your fingers, hand or arm numb hands tingling or pins and needles a weak thumb or difficulty gripping These symptoms often start slowly and come and go. They're usually worse at night. How to treat carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) yourself Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) sometimes gets better by itself in a few months, particularly if you have it because you're pregnant. Wear a wrist splint A wrist splint is something you wear on your hand to keep your wrist straight. It helps to relieve pressure on the nerve. You wear it at night while you sleep. You may need to wear a splint for up to 6 weeks before it starts to feel better. You can buy wrist splints online or from pharmacies. Stop or cut down on things that may be causing it Stop or cut down on anything that causes you to frequently bend your wrist or grip hard, such as using vibrating tools for work or playing an instrument. Painkillers Painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen may help carpal tunnel pain short-term. But there's little evidence to say they can treat the cause of CTS, so it's important not to rely on them. Hand exercises There's a small amount of evidence to suggest hand exercises help ease the symptoms of CTS. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy has instructions for simple hand exercises you can try . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms are getting worse or are not going away treatment at home for carpal tunnel syndrome is not working What happens at your appointment A GP can usually diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) by asking about your symptoms and checking your hand. If they're not sure it's CTS, they may refer you to hospital for: a test of the nerves in your wrist (nerve conduction test) scans such as an ultrasound scan or MRI scan Treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) from a GP If you have carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and a wrist splint does not help, the GP might recommend a steroid injection into your wrist. This brings down swelling around the nerve, easing the symptoms of CTS. Steroid injections are not always a cure. CTS can come back after a few months and you may need another injection. Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have carpal tunnel syndrome, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your local integrated care board (ICB) search online for NHS treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome near you Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery If your CTS is getting worse and other treatments have not worked, the GP might refer you to a specialist to discuss surgery. Surgery usually cures CTS. You and your specialist will decide together if it's the right treatment for you. An injection numbs your wrist so you do not feel pain (local anaesthetic) and a small cut is made in your hand. The carpal tunnel inside your wrist is cut so it no longer puts pressure on the nerve. The operation takes around 20 minutes and you do not have to stay in hospital overnight. It can take a month after the operation to get back to normal activities. What causes carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) happens when the carpal tunnel inside your wrist swells and squeezes 1 of your nerves (median nerve). You're more at risk of CTS if you: are overweight are pregnant do work or hobbies that mean you repeatedly bend your wrist or grip hard, such as using vibrating tools have certain other conditions, such as arthritis or diabetes have a parent, brother or sister with CTS have previously injured your wrist Page last reviewed: 17 April 2024 Next review due: 17 April 2027"

This page is about human bites and bites from animals, such as cats and dogs, that have broken the skin. There's a separate page about snake bites . What to do after animal or human bites There are some things you can do after being bitten by an animal or a person. Do clean the skin around the wound with soap and warm water – you can also use antiseptic, but try not to get it in the wound try to remove any objects like teeth, hair or dirt from the wound using running water gently squeeze the wound so it bleeds slightly (unless it's already bleeding) – this can help reduce the risk of infection press a dry dressing or clean cloth firmly onto the wound to stop the bleeding if it's bleeding heavily after cleaning the wound, gently pat it dry and cover it with a clean dressing take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease any pain and swelling – children under 16 should not take aspirin Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if: You've been bitten and: you think there may still be objects like teeth, hair or dirt in the wound the bite is hot or swollen (it may also be painful, red or darker than the surrounding skin) you have a high temperature fluid is leaking from the bite the bite smells unpleasant you were bitten on your hands or feet you were bitten by a person You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Go to A&E if: You've been bitten by an animal or person and: the wound is large or deep you were bitten on your face or head you cannot stop the bleeding Call 999 for an ambulance if you're unable to go to A&E. If a body part, such as part of a finger or ear has been torn off, wrap it in clean tissue and put it in a plastic bag. Put some ice around the bag and take it with you to hospital.

This page is about cataracts in adults. Find out about cataracts in children. Symptoms of cataracts in adults Symptoms of cataracts usually develop slowly. You'll often have cataracts in both eyes but the symptoms may be different in each eye. Symptoms include: blurred vision difficulty seeing at night difficulty reading and watching television your eyes being uncomfortable in, or sensitive to, light and glare looking at 1 object but seeing 2 (double vision) seeing glowing rings (halos) around lights colours look faded, especially blue If you wear glasses, you may notice that you need to change the prescription of your glasses more often than usual. Non-urgent advice: See an optician if: you have symptoms of cataracts If they think you have cataracts, they'll refer you to an eye specialist for more tests or treatment. Causes of cataracts in adults You may be more likely to get cataracts if: you're aged 60 or over you've had an eye injury or eye surgery in the past you have another eye condition, such as uveitis or being very short-sighted you've taken steroid medicines for long periods of time you smoke a parent, brother or sister has had cataracts you're a woman your eyes have been regularly exposed to a lot of sunlight without protection such as sunglasses Some long-term health conditions can also increase your risk of getting cataracts, such as type 2 diabetes , severe dermatitis and high blood pressure . Treatment for cataracts (cataract surgery) Cataracts do not usually need treatment straight away. Over time cataracts will get worse and you'll need cataract surgery if you want to to improve your sight. A GP or eye specialist will talk to you about whether or not you want surgery. This may depend on: how cataracts are affecting your daily life if cataracts are in one or both eyes If you decide to have surgery, there may be a wait for treatment. Ask your eye specialist how long you'll have to wait. Cataract surgery is done under a local anaesthetic. This means you'll be awake but you will not feel any pain. The cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial one. You should be able to go home on the same day. If you have cataracts in both eyes, they'll be treated on separate days.

    "title": "Overview-Childhood cataracts",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/childhood-cataracts/",
    "text": "Overview - Childhood cataracts Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Cataracts occur when changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent (clear). This results in cloudy or misty vision. The lens is the transparent structure located just behind the pupil (the black circle in the centre of the eye). It allows light to pass through to the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Cataracts most commonly affect older adults ( age-related cataracts ), but some babies are born with cataracts. Children can also develop them at a young age. These are known as childhood cataracts. Childhood cataracts are often referred to as: congenital cataracts – cataracts present when a baby is born or shortly afterwards developmental, infantile or juvenile cataracts – cataracts diagnosed in older babies or children Cataracts in babies and children are rare. In the UK, around 3 to 4 in every 10,000 babies are born with cataracts. Symptoms of cataracts in children In children, cataracts can affect 1 or both eyes. Cloudy patches in the lens can sometimes get bigger and more can develop, resulting in the child's vision becoming increasingly affected. As well as poor vision, cataracts can also cause \"wobbling eyes\" and a squint , where the eyes point in different directions. When your child is very young, it can be difficult to spot signs of cataracts. But your baby's eyes will be routinely examined at their newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of birth, and again when they're 6 to 8 weeks old. If a congenital cataract is suspected at the newborn examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby within 2 weeks of the examination. If a congenital cataract is suspected at the 6 to 8 week examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby by the time they're 11 weeks old. Sometimes cataracts can develop in children after these screening tests. It's particularly important to spot cataracts in children quickly because early treatment can reduce the risk of long-term vision problems. You should visit a GP or tell your health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight. Read more about the symptoms of childhood cataracts and diagnosing childhood cataracts . What causes cataracts in children? There are a number of reasons why a child may be born with cataracts or develop them while they're still young. But in many cases it is not possible to determine the exact cause. Possible causes include: a genetic fault inherited from the child's parents that caused the lens to develop abnormally certain genetic conditions, including Down's syndrome certain infections picked up by the mother during pregnancy, including rubella and chickenpox an injury to the eye after birth Read more about the causes of childhood cataracts . How childhood cataracts are treated Cataracts in children are often not too bad and have little or no effect on their vision. But if cataracts are affecting your child's vision, they can slow down or stop their normal sight development. In these cases, surgery to remove the affected lens (or lenses) will usually be recommended as soon as possible. Replacing the focusing power of the lens is as important as the surgery to remove it. The affected lens may sometimes be replaced with an artificial lens during surgery. But it's more common for the child to wear contact lenses or glasses after surgery to compensate for the lens that was removed. It can be difficult to predict exactly how much better your child's vision will be after treatment. It's likely there will always be a degree of reduced vision in the affected eye (or eyes). But many children born with childhood cataracts do not grow up to have serious problems with their vision. Read more about treating childhood cataracts . What are the risks? Cataracts that affect vision that are not quickly treated can sometimes cause irreversible damage to eyesight, including a permanently lazy eye and even blindness in severe cases. Cataract surgery is generally successful, with a low risk of serious complications. The most common risk associated with cataract surgery is a condition that can affect artificial lens implants called posterior capsule opacification (PCO), which causes cloudy vision to return. Another important risk of surgery is glaucoma , where pressure builds inside the eye. Without successful treatment, glaucoma can cause irreversible damage to key structures in the eye. Although some of the possible complications of cataract surgery can affect your child's vision, they can often be treated with medicine or further surgery. Read more about the complications of childhood cataracts . Can cataracts in children be prevented? It's not usually possible to prevent cataracts, particularly those that are inherited (run in the family). But following the advice of your midwife or a GP to avoid infections during pregnancy (including making sure all your vaccinations are up to date before getting pregnant) may reduce the chances of your child being born with cataracts. If you previously had a baby with childhood cataracts and are planning another pregnancy, you may wish to speak with a GP about whether genetic counselling would be appropriate. Genetic counselling can help couples who may be at risk of passing an inherited condition on to their child. Read more about infections in pregnancy and genetic and genomic testing .

    "text": "Cataracts in adults Cataracts is where the lens in your eye becomes cloudy, causing blurred vision and loss of sight. It usually affects older adults and can be treated with surgery. This page is about cataracts in adults. Find out about cataracts in children. Symptoms of cataracts in adults Symptoms of cataracts usually develop slowly. You'll often have cataracts in both eyes but the symptoms may be different in each eye. Symptoms include: blurred vision difficulty seeing at night difficulty reading and watching television your eyes being uncomfortable in, or sensitive to, light and glare looking at 1 object but seeing 2 (double vision) seeing glowing rings (halos) around lights colours look faded, especially blue If you wear glasses, you may notice that you need to change the prescription of your glasses more often than usual. Non-urgent advice: See an optician if: you have symptoms of cataracts If they think you have cataracts, they'll refer you to an eye specialist for more tests or treatment. Causes of cataracts in adults You may be more likely to get cataracts if: you're aged 60 or over you've had an eye injury or eye surgery in the past you have another eye condition, such as uveitis or being very short-sighted you've taken steroid medicines for long periods of time you smoke a parent, brother or sister has had cataracts you're a woman your eyes have been regularly exposed to a lot of sunlight without protection such as sunglasses Some long-term health conditions can also increase your risk of getting cataracts, such as type 2 diabetes , severe dermatitis and high blood pressure . Treatment for cataracts (cataract surgery) Cataracts do not usually need treatment straight away. Over time cataracts will get worse and you'll need cataract surgery if you want to to improve your sight. A GP or eye specialist will talk to you about whether or not you want surgery. This may depend on: how cataracts are affecting your daily life if cataracts are in one or both eyes If you decide to have surgery, there may be a wait for treatment. Ask your eye specialist how long you'll have to wait. Cataract surgery is done under a local anaesthetic. This means you'll be awake but you will not feel any pain. The cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial one. You should be able to go home on the same day. If you have cataracts in both eyes, they'll be treated on separate days. Information: Find out more: Cataract surgery How cataracts affect your life Cataracts affect your sight and without treatment will eventually cause sight loss. Using stronger glasses and brighter light for reading may help for a while. For most people, cataract surgery will help to improve their vision. Recovery from surgery is quick and serious complications are rare. Driving with cataracts You may still be able to drive if your vision is good enough. You must let the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) know if your eyesight does not meet the minimum standards needed for driving. Ask an optician if you are not sure.

    "text": "Catarrh Catarrh is a build-up of mucus in your nose and sinuses and phlegm in your throat. It usually clears up by itself but see a GP if it lasts longer than a few weeks. Symptoms of catarrh You may get catarrh if you have an infection like a cold , flu or sinusitis . Symptoms of catarrh include: a constantly blocked nose feeling like there's a lump or something stuck in your throat a frequent need to swallow or cough to try to clear your throat a feeling that mucus is slowly dripping down the back of your throat (postnasal drip) a crackling feeling in your ears These symptoms usually only last a few days, but sometimes they can last longer. Things you can do to help ease catarrh Although catarrh can be annoying, phlegm and mucus are not harmful and are the body's way of clearing infection. It usually goes away by itself, but there are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms. Do drink plenty of water sip ice cold water when you need to clear your throat, rather than coughing or swallowing try using a humidifier to help loosen the mucus in your nose and throat try using an extra pillow in bed so you sleep in a more upright position, rather than lying flat try gargling with salt water try rinsing your nose with salt water How to rinse your nose with a homemade salt water solution Boil a pint of water, then leave it to cool. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water. Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it. Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat. Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day until your nose feels more comfortable. You do not need to use all of the solution, but make a fresh solution each time you clean your nose. A pharmacist can help with catarrh You could ask a pharmacist about: decongestants and other medicines to help relieve catarrh salt water nose rinses – you can get several types, including specially designed bottles, nasal sprays and sachets Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have the symptoms of catarrh for more than a few weeks The GP may want to rule out other conditions that could be causing your catarrh, such as nasal polyps. Treatments from a GP A GP may suggest trying treatments for catarrh that you can get from a pharmacist, like decongestant medicines and salt water nose rinses. If your catarrh is caused by nasal polyps , a GP may prescribe steroid spray or nose drops. If these do not work, surgery may be needed to remove the polyps. Causes of catarrh Catarrh is your body's natural reaction to things like infection. The lining in your nose, sinuses and throat becomes swollen and creates more mucus than normal. Causes of catarrh include: infections like cold , flu and sinusitis pollution and cigarette smoke allergic reactions to things like pollen, dust and animals conditions that affect the nose, such as nasal polyps Page last reviewed: 17 November 2022 Next review due: 17 November 2025"

    "title": "Cavernoma",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cavernoma/",
    "text": "Cavernoma A cavernoma is a cluster of abnormal blood vessels, usually found in the brain and spinal cord. They're sometimes known as cavernous angiomas, cavernous haemangiomas, or cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). A typical cavernoma looks like a raspberry. It's filled with blood that flows slowly through vessels that are like \"caverns\". A cavernoma can vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres across. Symptoms of cavernoma A cavernoma often does not cause symptoms, but when symptoms do occur they can include: bleeding (haemorrhage) fits (seizures) headaches neurological problems, such as dizziness, slurred speech (dysarthria) , double vision , balance problems and tremor weakness, numbness, tiredness, memory problems and difficulty concentrating a type of stroke called a haemorrhagic stroke The severity and duration of symptoms can vary depending on the size, location and number of cavernomas. Problems can occur if the cavernoma bleeds or presses on certain areas of the brain. The cells lining a cavernoma are often thinner than those that line normal blood vessels, which means they're prone to leaking blood. In most cases, bleeding is small – usually around half a teaspoonful of blood – and may not cause other symptoms. But severe haemorrhages can be life threatening and may lead to long-lasting problems. You should seek medical help as soon as possible if you experience any of the above symptoms for the first time. What causes a cavernoma? In most cases, there's no clear reason why a person develops a cavernoma. The condition can sometimes run in families – less than 50% of cases are thought to be genetic. But in most cases cavernomas occur randomly. Genetic testing can be carried out to determine whether a cavernoma is genetic or whether it's occurred randomly. If you or your partner have the genetic type of cavernoma, there's a 1 in 2 chance of passing on the condition to any children that you conceive. Some cavernoma cases have also been linked to radiation exposure, such as previously having radiotherapy to the brain, usually as a child. Read more about medical radiation on the GOV.UK website . Who's affected It's estimated about 1 in every 600 people in the UK has a cavernoma that does not cause symptoms. Every year, around 1 person in every 400,000 in the UK is diagnosed with a cavernoma that has caused symptoms. If symptoms do occur, most people will develop them between the ages of 20 and 40. Diagnosing cavernoma MRI scans are mainly used to diagnose cavernomas. As symptoms are not always evident, many people are only diagnosed with a cavernoma after having an MRI scan for another reason. A CT scan or angiography can also be used to diagnose cavernoma, but they're not as reliable as an MRI scan. Monitoring your symptoms Any symptoms you have may come and go as the cavernoma bleeds and then reabsorbs blood. It's important to closely monitor your symptoms, as any new symptoms might be a sign of a haemorrhage. Your doctor can advise you about what to do if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. They may also recommend having a further brain scan. MRI and CT scans can be used to detect bleeding on the brain, although they cannot necessarily identify cavernomas at an increased risk of bleeding. This is because the features of a cavernoma that can be seen on a brain scan, such as an increase in size, do not appear to be directly linked to the likelihood of bleeding. Although cavernomas can get bigger, large cavernomas are not any more likely to bleed than smaller ones. What are the chances of a cavernoma bleeding? The risk of having a haemorrhage varies from person to person, depending on whether you have experienced any bleeding before. If you have not had any bleeding before, it's estimated you have a less than 1% chance of experiencing a haemorrhage each year. If your cavernoma has bled previously, your risk of having another haemorrhage is somewhere between 4% and 25% each year. But this risk decreases progressively over time if you do not experience any further bleeds. Your level of risk will be one of the main factors taken into consideration when deciding if you would benefit from treatment. Treating cavernoma The recommended treatment for cavernoma will vary depending on a person's circumstances and factors such as size, location and number of cavernoma. Some cavernoma symptoms, such as headaches and seizures, can be controlled with medication. But more invasive treatment may sometimes be offered to reduce the risk of future haemorrhages. The decision to have such treatment is made on a case-by-case basis in discussion with your doctor. Types of treatment offered in the UK to reduce the risk of haemorrhages include: neurosurgery – carried out under general anaesthetic to remove the cavernoma stereotactic radiosurgery – where a single concentrated dose of radiation is aimed directly at the cavernoma, causing it to become thickened and scarred In most cases, neurosurgery is preferred to stereotactic radiosurgery because the effectiveness of radiosurgery in preventing haemorrhages is unknown. Stereotactic radiosurgery is usually only considered if the position of the cavernoma makes neurosurgery too difficult or dangerous. Risks of invasive treatment include stroke and death, although the exact risks depend on the location of the cavernoma. You should discuss the possible risks of treatment with your doctor beforehand. Driving If you have a cavernoma that's causing symptoms, it may affect how you drive. Legally, you have to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) that you have a cavernoma. If you have been diagnosed with a cavernoma, you may be advised to stop driving until your symptoms are controlled. The GOV.UK website has advice about how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition . Further information International research programmes are trying to find out more about what causes cavernoma and how these abnormal blood vessels are formed. The long-term outlook for people with cavernomas is also being investigated. The Cavernoma Alliance UK website has more information about the condition .

    "text": "Overview - Cavernous sinus thrombosis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Complications Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a blood clot in the cavernous sinuses. It can be life-threatening. The cavernous sinuses are hollow spaces located under the brain, behind each eye socket. A major blood vessel called the jugular vein carries blood through the cavernous sinuses away from the brain. A blood clot can develop when an infection in the face or skull spreads to the cavernous sinuses. The blood clot develops to prevent the infection spreading further, but it can restrict the blood flow from the brain, which can damage the brain, eyes and nerves running between them. Sometimes, clots can develop without infection. Read more about the causes of cavernous sinus thrombosis . Symptoms of cavernous sinus thrombosis include: a sharp and severe headache , particularly around the eye swelling and bulging of the eye(s) and the surrounding tissues eye pain that's often severe double vision a high temperature Read more about the symptoms of cavernous sinus thrombosis . When to seek medical advice Call 111 immediately if you experience: a severe headache that is not relieved with painkillers or is getting worse a headache that feels worse when you lie down or bend over a headache that's unusual for you and occurs with blurred vision, feeling or being sick, problems speaking, weakness, drowsiness or seizures (fits) eye pain or swelling of one or both eyes a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal (tummy) pain While it's highly unlikely to be the result of cavernous sinus thrombosis, these symptoms need to be investigated. In very rare cases, cavernous sinus thrombosis can occur after having some types of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. If this happens, symptoms can appear between 4 days and 4 weeks after vaccination. After an examination, you may be referred for tests, including a CT scan , an MRI scan and blood tests . Treating cavernous sinus thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis needs treatment in hospital. In most cases, you'll be treated in an intensive care unit, so you can be closely monitored. Antibiotics Antibiotics are the main treatment for cavernous sinus thrombosis. Treatment will be started as soon as possible, even before tests have confirmed if a bacterial infection is responsible. If tests later show that a bacterial infection did not cause the condition, antibiotic treatment may be stopped. Most people will require antibiotics for a few weeks to ensure the infection has been fully cleared from their body. The antibiotics will be given through an intravenous drip directly connected to one of your veins. Some people will experience side effects when taking antibiotics. These are generally mild and can include diarrhoea, nausea and a skin rash. Anticoagulants You may also be given a medicine called heparin to help dissolve the clot and prevent further clots. Heparin is an anticoagulant medicine , which means it makes the blood less sticky. Some people also need to take anticoagulant tablets for a few months or longer after leaving hospital. Corticosteroids Some people are also given steroid medicine ( corticosteroids ). Corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and swelling in your body. Surgical drainage If the symptoms of cavernous sinus thrombosis were caused by an infection spreading from a boil or sinusitis, it may be necessary to drain away pus from that site. This can be done either using a needle or during surgery. How long does treatment last? Several weeks of antibiotic treatment are usually necessary to ensure the infection has cleared. However, it can take a long time to recover fully, and it may be several months before you're well enough to leave hospital. Complications of cavernous sinus thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a very serious condition. Even with prompt treatment, as many as 1 in 3 people with the condition may die. Some people who survive will develop long-term health problems due to damage to their brain, such as persistent headaches and fits, or some degree of vision loss . Read more about the complications of cavernous sinus thrombosis . Who's affected? It's difficult to say exactly how many people are affected by cavernous sinus thrombosis, but it's thought to be very rare. The condition affects people of all ages and tends to be more common in women than men. This may be because pregnancy and taking the oral contraceptive pill can make women more vulnerable to blood clots. Page last reviewed: 05 August 2021 Next review due: 05 August 2024 Next : Symptoms"

MARAZZI / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/252613/view Treatment for cellulitis For mild cellulitis affecting a small area of skin, a doctor will prescribe antibiotic tablets, usually for a week. Your symptoms might get worse in the first 48 hours of treatment, but should then start to improve. Contact your GP if you do not start to feel better 2 to 3 days after starting antibiotics. It's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better. Most people make a full recovery after 7 to 10 days. If cellulitis is severe, you might be referred to hospital for treatment. To stop cellulitis coming back Some people with recurring cellulitis might be prescribed low-dose long-term antibiotics to stop infections coming back. Things you can do to help with cellulitis As well as taking antibiotics for cellulitis, you can help speed up your recovery by: taking paracetamol or ibuprofen for the pain raising the affected body part on a pillow or chair when you're sitting or lying down, to reduce swelling regularly moving the joint near the affected body part, such as your wrist or ankle, to stop it getting stiff drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration not wearing compression stockings until you're better You can reduce the chances of getting cellulitis again by: keeping skin clean and well moisturised cleaning any cuts or wounds and using antiseptic cream preventing cuts and scrapes by wearing appropriate clothing and footwear wearing gloves if working outside Complications of cellulitis If cellulitis is not treated quickly, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the blood, muscles and bones. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You have cellulitis with: a very high temperature, or you feel hot and shivery a fast heartbeat or fast breathing purple patches on your skin, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin feeling dizzy or faint confusion or disorientation cold, clammy or pale skin unresponsiveness or loss of consciousness These are symptoms of serious complications, which can be life threatening. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. How you get cellulitis Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria can infect the deeper layers of your skin if it's broken, for example, because of an insect bite or cut, or if it's cracked and dry. Sometimes the break in the skin is too small to notice. You cannot catch cellulitis from another person, as it affects the deeper layers of the skin. You're more at risk of cellulitis if you: have poor circulation in your arms, legs, hands or feet, for example, because you're overweight find it difficult to move around have a weakened immune system, for example, because of chemotherapy treatment or diabetes have lymphoedema , which causes fluid build-up under the skin inject drugs have a wound from surgery have had cellulitis before People who are more at risk of cellulitis should treat athlete's foot promptly.

It's caused by a problem with the brain that develops before, during or soon after birth. Symptoms of cerebral palsy The symptoms of cerebral palsy are not usually obvious just after a baby is born. They normally become noticeable from an early age. Symptoms can include: delays in reaching development milestones – for example, not sitting by 8 months or not walking by 18 months seeming too stiff or too floppy weak arms or legs fidgety, jerky or clumsy movements random, uncontrolled movements walking on tiptoes a range of other problems – such as swallowing problems , speaking problems, vision problems and learning disabilities The severity of symptoms can vary significantly. Some people only have minor problems, while others may be severely disabled. Read more about the symptoms of cerebral palsy When to get medical advice Speak to your health visitor or a GP if you have any concerns about your child's health or development. Symptoms like those of cerebral palsy can have a number of different causes and are not necessarily a sign of anything serious. Your child may be referred to specialists in child development who can do some checks and tests. Read more about tests for cerebral palsy Causes of cerebral palsy Cerebral palsy can happen if a baby's brain does not develop normally while they're in the womb, or is damaged during or soon after birth. Causes of cerebral palsy include: bleeding in the baby's brain or reduced blood and oxygen supply to their brain an infection caught during pregnancy the brain temporarily not getting enough oxygen (asphyxiation) during a difficult birth meningitis a serious head injury But in many cases, the exact cause is not clear.

    "text": "Overview - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of inherited conditions that damage the peripheral nerves. It's also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) or peroneal muscular atrophy (PMA). The peripheral nerves are found outside the main central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). They control the muscles and relay sensory information, such as the sense of touch, from the limbs to the brain. People with CMT may have: muscle weakness in their feet, ankles, legs and hands an awkward way of walking (gait) highly arched or very flat feet numbness in the feet, arms and hands The symptoms of CMT usually start to appear between the ages of 5 and 15, although they sometimes do not develop until well into middle age or later. CMT is a progressive condition. This means the symptoms slowly get worse, making everyday tasks increasingly difficult. Find out more about the symptoms of CMT What causes CMT? CMT is caused by an inherited fault in one of the many genes responsible for the development of the peripheral nerves. This fault means the nerves become damaged over time. A child with CMT may have inherited the genetic fault responsible for the condition from 1 or both of their parents. There's no single faulty gene that causes CMT. There are many types of CMT that are caused by different genetic faults and these can be inherited in several different ways. The chances of passing CMT to your child depend on the specific genetic faults you and your partner carry. Find out more about the causes of CMT Testing for CMT See your GP if you think you may have symptoms of CMT. If they suspect CMT, they'll refer you to a doctor who specialises in treating conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist) for further tests to confirm the diagnosis. You should also see your GP if you or your partner have a family history of CMT and are considering having a baby. Your GP can refer you for genetic counselling , where you can discuss your concerns and the options available with a genetics specialist. Find out more about diagnosing CMT How CMT is treated There's currently no cure for CMT. But treatments can help relieve symptoms, aid mobility, and increase independence and quality of life for people with the condition. These treatments may include: physiotherapy and certain types of exercise occupational therapy walking aids In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct problems such as flat feet and muscle contractures, where muscles shorten and lose their normal range of movement. Find out more about treating CMT Living with CMT CMT is not life threatening and most people with the condition have the same life expectancy as a person without the condition. But it can make everyday activities very difficult. Living with a long-term progressive condition can also have a significant emotional impact. Some people find it helpful to speak to others with the condition through support groups. You may also benefit from a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) .

    "text": "Charles Bonnet syndrome Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition where you see things that are not real (hallucinations). It can happen if you've lost a lot of your sight. It's not caused by a mental health problem or dementia. Symptoms of Charles Bonnet syndrome The main symptom of Charles Bonnet syndrome is seeing things that are not real ( hallucinations ) after losing a lot of your sight. It's often linked to eye conditions such as age-related macular degeneration or cataracts . The hallucinations can: be patterns such as shapes or lines be of people, animals, objects or places be moving or still be in black and white or colour happen suddenly last for a few minutes or several hours The hallucinations are only things you see. You do not hear, smell or feel things that are not there. Most people with Charles Bonnet syndrome know the hallucinations are not real. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you or someone else have hallucinations It's important to rule out more serious conditions that cause hallucinations. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatments for Charles Bonnet syndrome There's currently no cure for Charles Bonnet syndrome, but over time the hallucinations usually happen less often. If you're finding the hallucinations upsetting, speak to a GP. They can refer you for talking therapy that can help with hallucinations. Things you can do to help with Charles Bonnet syndrome There's some things you can try when a hallucination starts that may make it go away. Do turn on the lights or move somewhere lighter if it's dark when you have a hallucination turn off the lights or move somewhere darker if it's light when you have a hallucination move your eyes from left to right without moving your head – do this 15 to 30 times, then pause and repeat a few times stand up and move around watch TV or listen to the radio reach out to touch the hallucination Other things that can help There are some other things that can help if you have Charles Bonnet syndrome, such as: making sure you're well rested and are getting enough sleep at night – the hallucinations may be worse when you're tired or stressed using bright light bulbs in your home and using a magnifying device to make things bigger when you need to – making use of the sight you have may help the hallucinations happen less often getting regular eye tests – an optician can check for further changes in your eyes and give you advice about how to make the best use of the sight you have A GP, optician or ophthalmologist (eye doctor) can refer you to a specialist low-vision service for advice about things to help with your sight. Information: Find out more Find out more about managing Charles Bonnet syndrome from the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) Causes of Charles Bonnet syndrome Charles Bonnet syndrome is linked to vision loss. When you lose your sight, your brain gets less information from your eyes than it's used to. Your brain sometimes makes up for this by creating hallucinations. Not everyone who loses their sight will get Charles Bonnet syndrome. You're more likely to get it if: your sight suddenly gets worse you lose sight in both eyes It's common in people who have eye conditions such as age-related macular degeneration or cataracts . Charles Bonnet syndrome is not caused by a mental health problem or dementia . Help and support There are some charities and organisations that provide information and support for people with Charles Bonnet syndrome.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-infection/",
    "text": "Chest infection A chest infection is an infection of the lungs or large airways. Some chest infections are mild and clear up on their own, but others can be severe and life threatening. Symptoms of a chest infection Chest infections often follow colds or flu . The main symptoms are: a chesty cough – you may cough up green or yellow mucus wheezing and shortness of breath chest pain or discomfort a high temperature a headache aching muscles tiredness These symptoms can be unpleasant, but they usually get better on their own in about 7 to 10 days. The cough and mucus can last up to 3 weeks. How to treat a chest infection yourself If you have a chest infection, there are things you can do to ease the symptoms. Do get plenty of rest drink lots of water to loosen the mucus and make it easier to cough up raise your head up while sleeping using extra pillows to make breathing easier and clear your chest of mucus use painkillers to bring down a high temperature and ease headaches and muscle pain drink a hot lemon and honey drink to relieve a sore throat Don’t do not let children breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water because of the risk of scalding do not give aspirin to children under 16 do not smoke – it can make your symptoms worse How to make a hot lemon and honey drink Squeeze half a lemon into a mug of boiled water Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey Drink while still warm Do not give hot drinks to small children. Do not give honey to children under 12 months old. A pharmacist can help with a chest infection A pharmacist can recommend cough medicines to loosen the mucus in your lungs. This will make the mucus easier to cough up and help clear the infection from your lungs. Cough medicines are not suitable for children under 6 years old. Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have a chest infection and: you feel very unwell or your symptoms get worse you cough up blood or blood-stained mucus you've had a cough for more than 3 weeks you're pregnant you're over 65 your immune system is weak – for example, you have a condition like diabetes or you're having chemotherapy you have a long-term health condition, such as a heart, lung or kidney condition You may have pneumonia if your symptoms are severe. Treatment from a GP for a chest infection Treatment for a chest infection will depend on the cause. A chest infection will either be caused by: a virus (like viral bronchitis ) – this usually clears up by itself after a few weeks and antibiotics will not help bacteria (like pneumonia) – a GP may prescribe antibiotics (make sure you complete the whole course as advised by the GP, even if you start to feel better) Antibiotics are only used to treat bacterial chest infections. They're not used for treating viral chest infections, like flu or viral bronchitis. This is because antibiotics do not work for viral infections. You may need a blood test or a sample of your mucus may need to be tested to see what's causing your chest infection. How to prevent chest infections How to avoid spreading chest infections To avoid passing a chest infection on to others: cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze wash your hands regularly throw away used tissues immediately Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities. How to avoid getting a chest infection If you keep getting chest infections or you're at risk of getting one (for example, because you're over 65 or have a serious long-term health condition): ask a GP about the annual flu vaccine ask if you should have the pneumococcal vaccine – this helps prevent pneumonia try to quit smoking if you smoke cut down on how much alcohol you drink Page last reviewed: 21 June 2023 Next review due: 21 June 2026"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chiari-malformation/",
    "text": "Chiari malformation A Chiari malformation, previously called an Arnold-Chiari malformation, is where the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal. Credit: Multimedia Team - nhs.uk There are 4 main types, but type 1, called Chiari I, is the most common. In someone with Chiari I, the lowest part of the back of the brain extends into the spinal canal. This can put pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord, and obstruct the flow of fluid. This page focuses on Chiari I malformations. Are Chiari I malformations serious? The severity of Chiari malformations can vary from person to person, but generally: Chiari I malformations are not considered life-threatening some people experience painful headaches, movement problems and other unpleasant symptoms but many people will not have any symptoms there's a chance of developing syringomyelia (where a fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx develops in the spinal cord), which can damage the spinal cord if not treated promptly surgery can usually stop the symptoms getting worse and can sometimes improve them, although some problems may remain Talk to your doctor about what the condition means, what the implications may be for your health and what treatment you may need. Symptoms of Chiari I malformations Many people with a Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. Sometimes they're only found after an MRI scan of the brain is carried out for another reason. If symptoms do develop, they can include: headaches – these are usually felt at the back of the head and may be brought on or made worse by coughing, straining, sneezing or bending over neck pain dizziness and balance problems muscle weakness numbness or tingling in the arms or legs blurred vision, double vision and sensitivity to light swallowing problems hearing loss and tinnitus feeling and being sick difficulty sleeping ( insomnia ) and clinical depression If you develop syringomyelia, you may also experience problems using your hands, difficulty walking, pain, and problems with bladder or bowel control. If you've been diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, you should contact your doctor for advice if you develop any new symptoms or your symptoms worsen. Treatments for Chiari I malformations Treatment for Chiari I malformation depends on whether you have any symptoms and how severe they are. You might not need any treatment if you do not have any symptoms. Painkillers can help relieve any headaches and neck pain. If your headaches are severe or you have problems caused by the pressure on your spinal cord (such as movement difficulties), surgery may be recommended. Surgery The main operation for Chiari malformation is called decompression surgery. Under general anaesthetic a cut is made at the back of your head and the surgeon removes a small piece of bone from the base of your skull. They may also remove a small piece of bone from the top of your spine. This will help reduce the pressure on your brain and allow the fluid in and around your brain and spinal cord to flow normally. Read more about decompression surgery for Chiari malformation: Brain & Spine Foundation: Chiari malformation - information for adults Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust: cranio-cervical decompression for Chiari malformation - information for children Other procedures that may be necessary include: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) – a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting – a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Untethering – some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine. Spinal fixation – some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , and may require surgery to stabilise their spine. The aim of surgery is to stop existing symptoms getting any worse. Some people also experience an improvement in their symptoms, particularly their headaches. However, surgery sometimes results in no improvement or symptoms getting worse. There's also a small risk of serious complications, such as paralysis or a stroke . Talk to your surgeon about the different surgical options and what the benefits and risks of each are. Causes of Chiari I malformations The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done. Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain. Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain ( hydrocephalus ), and some types of brain tumour. Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development. But the risk of passing a Chiari malformation on to your child is very small. And remember: even if your children do inherit it, they may not experience symptoms. Information about you If you have been affected by a Chiari malformation, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

The spots cover the lower part of a person's back and the side of their hip. There are about 50 spots in total, varying in size from about 1mm to 1cm. Some are 1cm to 3cm apart, but others are further apart. Most of the spots have scabs over them. The scabs are pink, purple or grey. There are also a few spots without scabs, which look like small blisters. These are slightly darker in colour than the person's skin. Information: If you're not sure it's chickenpox Check other rashes in children How you can treat chickenpox yourself If you have chickenpox, you'll need to stay off school, nursery or work until all the spots have formed a scab. This is usually 5 days after the spots first appeared. There are things you can do to treat chickenpox yourself at home without needing to see a GP. Do drink plenty of fluids (try ice lollies if your child is not drinking) take paracetamol to help with any pain and discomfort cut your child's fingernails and put socks on their hands at night to stop them scratching use cooling creams or gels from a pharmacy speak to a pharmacist about using antihistamine medicine to help itching bathe in cool water and pat the skin dry (do not rub) dress in loose clothes Don’t do not use ibuprofen unless you're told to by a doctor, as it may cause serious skin infections do not give aspirin to children under 16 years do not scratch the spots, as scratching can cause scarring Important Do not go near newborn babies or anyone who's pregnant or has a weakened immune system, as chickenpox can be dangerous for them. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you're not sure it's chickenpox you're concerned about yourself or your child Tell the receptionist you think it might be chickenpox before going in to a GP surgery. Urgent advice: Get advice from NHS 111 now if: your or your child's chickenpox symptoms suddenly get worse your child has chickenpox and is showing signs of dehydration , such as fewer wet nappies the skin around the chickenpox blisters is hot, painful and red (redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin) you're breastfeeding and have chickenpox symptoms you're pregnant and have not had chickenpox before (or you're not sure) and you've been near someone with chickenpox you have a weakened immune system and have been near someone with chickenpox you think your newborn baby has chickenpox or has been near someone with chickenpox Some people may be able to take medicine to prevent complications. It needs to be started within 24 hours of the spots appearing. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Call 111 if you need advice for a child under 5 years old. How chickenpox is spread You can spread chickenpox to other people from 2 days before your spots appear until they have all formed scabs, which is usually 5 days after your spots appeared. The spots start appearing around 1 to 3 weeks after you caught chickenpox. You can catch chickenpox from: being in the same room as someone with it touching things that have fluid from the blisters on them someone who has shingles if you have not had chickenpox before (but you cannot catch shingles from someone who has chickenpox) The chickenpox vaccine You can get the chickenpox vaccine on the NHS if there's a risk you could spread the virus to someone who has a weakened immune system. For example, a child can be vaccinated if one of their parents is having chemotherapy. You can also pay for the vaccine at some private clinics or travel clinics. It costs between £120 and £200.

A pharmacist can help with chilblains You can ask a pharmacist about: the best painkiller to take creams that can help to soothe the itching if you need to see a GP Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have chilblains and your skin has not got any better after 2 to 3 weeks there is pus coming out of your skin your temperature is very high or you feel hot or shivery you keep getting chilblains you have diabetes and have chilblains – foot problems can be more serious if you have diabetes What happens at your appointment A GP will check your symptoms to see if you have chilblains. They may need to refer you for further tests with a specialist if they're not sure why you're getting chilblains. Rarely, the GP will prescribe a medicine that can help your chilblains clear up. Causes of chilblains You can get chilblains when it's cold. The cold makes the tiny blood vessels in your fingers and toes get smaller. This stops blood moving around as easily. If you warm up too quickly, the blood vessels get bigger again and blood rushes to your fingers and toes. This can cause pain or swelling.

    "title": "Overview-Childhood cataracts",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/childhood-cataracts/",
    "text": "Overview - Childhood cataracts Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Cataracts occur when changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent (clear). This results in cloudy or misty vision. The lens is the transparent structure located just behind the pupil (the black circle in the centre of the eye). It allows light to pass through to the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Cataracts most commonly affect older adults ( age-related cataracts ), but some babies are born with cataracts. Children can also develop them at a young age. These are known as childhood cataracts. Childhood cataracts are often referred to as: congenital cataracts – cataracts present when a baby is born or shortly afterwards developmental, infantile or juvenile cataracts – cataracts diagnosed in older babies or children Cataracts in babies and children are rare. In the UK, around 3 to 4 in every 10,000 babies are born with cataracts. Symptoms of cataracts in children In children, cataracts can affect 1 or both eyes. Cloudy patches in the lens can sometimes get bigger and more can develop, resulting in the child's vision becoming increasingly affected. As well as poor vision, cataracts can also cause \"wobbling eyes\" and a squint , where the eyes point in different directions. When your child is very young, it can be difficult to spot signs of cataracts. But your baby's eyes will be routinely examined at their newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of birth, and again when they're 6 to 8 weeks old. If a congenital cataract is suspected at the newborn examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby within 2 weeks of the examination. If a congenital cataract is suspected at the 6 to 8 week examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby by the time they're 11 weeks old. Sometimes cataracts can develop in children after these screening tests. It's particularly important to spot cataracts in children quickly because early treatment can reduce the risk of long-term vision problems. You should visit a GP or tell your health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight. Read more about the symptoms of childhood cataracts and diagnosing childhood cataracts . What causes cataracts in children? There are a number of reasons why a child may be born with cataracts or develop them while they're still young. But in many cases it is not possible to determine the exact cause. Possible causes include: a genetic fault inherited from the child's parents that caused the lens to develop abnormally certain genetic conditions, including Down's syndrome certain infections picked up by the mother during pregnancy, including rubella and chickenpox an injury to the eye after birth Read more about the causes of childhood cataracts . How childhood cataracts are treated Cataracts in children are often not too bad and have little or no effect on their vision. But if cataracts are affecting your child's vision, they can slow down or stop their normal sight development. In these cases, surgery to remove the affected lens (or lenses) will usually be recommended as soon as possible. Replacing the focusing power of the lens is as important as the surgery to remove it. The affected lens may sometimes be replaced with an artificial lens during surgery. But it's more common for the child to wear contact lenses or glasses after surgery to compensate for the lens that was removed. It can be difficult to predict exactly how much better your child's vision will be after treatment. It's likely there will always be a degree of reduced vision in the affected eye (or eyes). But many children born with childhood cataracts do not grow up to have serious problems with their vision. Read more about treating childhood cataracts . What are the risks? Cataracts that affect vision that are not quickly treated can sometimes cause irreversible damage to eyesight, including a permanently lazy eye and even blindness in severe cases. Cataract surgery is generally successful, with a low risk of serious complications. The most common risk associated with cataract surgery is a condition that can affect artificial lens implants called posterior capsule opacification (PCO), which causes cloudy vision to return. Another important risk of surgery is glaucoma , where pressure builds inside the eye. Without successful treatment, glaucoma can cause irreversible damage to key structures in the eye. Although some of the possible complications of cataract surgery can affect your child's vision, they can often be treated with medicine or further surgery. Read more about the complications of childhood cataracts . Can cataracts in children be prevented? It's not usually possible to prevent cataracts, particularly those that are inherited (run in the family). But following the advice of your midwife or a GP to avoid infections during pregnancy (including making sure all your vaccinations are up to date before getting pregnant) may reduce the chances of your child being born with cataracts. If you previously had a baby with childhood cataracts and are planning another pregnancy, you may wish to speak with a GP about whether genetic counselling would be appropriate. Genetic counselling can help couples who may be at risk of passing an inherited condition on to their child. Read more about infections in pregnancy and genetic and genomic testing . Information about your child If your child has had cataracts, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

If not treated it can cause serious health problems. Symptoms of chlamydia Most people who have chlamydia do not have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms they can start from 1 week to several months after infection. Symptoms in women Chlamydia can cause symptoms in women. These symptoms can affect anyone with a vagina: vaginal discharge that is not normal for you bleeding after sex or between periods a burning feeling when you pee pain in your lower tummy Symptoms in men Chlamydia can cause symptoms in men. These symptoms can affect anyone with a penis: white, cloudy or watery discharge from the tip of your penis burning and itching around the testicles (balls) and penis pain and swelling in the testicles a burning feeling when you pee Other symptoms in men and women Chlamydia can affect other parts of your body that come into contact with semen or vaginal fluid. This can cause: pain, bleeding, and discharge from your bottom a sore throat eye redness, pain and discharge Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if: you or a sexual partner think you might have chlamydia you or a sexual partner have had sex without a condom you’re pregnant or planning to get pregnant and think you might have chlamydia Find a sexual health clinic Self-test kits If you do not have symptoms but want a test, you can use a self-test kit for chlamydia at home and send it to a lab to be tested. If the test shows you have chlamydia, you’ll be contacted and told what to do next. You may be able to get a free self-test kit from: a sexual health clinic some pharmacies You can also buy a self-test kit for chlamydia from some pharmacies. Find a pharmacy If you're aged under 25 you may also be able to get free chlamydia home test kits for under 25s . What happens at your appointment A doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and sexual partners. They may need to check your penis or vagina. When you make your appointment, let them know if you'd like someone else to be in the room with you (a chaperone) – this could be someone you know, another doctor, nurse or a trained member of staff. You may be asked to give a pee sample. They may use a swab (like a cotton bud) to take a sample of fluid from your penis or vagina. You may be able to do the swab yourself. They may also need to take a swab from your bottom (anus), throat or eyes if these areas are affected. You can be tested even if you do not have any symptoms. You may also be offered tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the same time. Information: Contacting sexual partners If you have chlamydia, your current and recent sexual partners need to be tested. A sexual health clinic can help you contact your partners, or they can contact them for you. Treatment for chlamydia Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics. This may be a single dose, or tablets you take for 7 to 14 days. Sometimes you may start treatment before the test results come back. You may need to be tested again after treatment to check you no longer have chlamydia. If you’re pregnant, you’ll be tested again 4 weeks after treatment. Important Avoid vaginal, anal or oral sex until you and your partner (if you have one) have finished treatment and tests show you no longer have chlamydia. How to avoid getting and spreading chlamydia Chlamydia is spread through vaginal fluid and semen. It can pass from person to person by having vaginal, oral or anal sex without a condom. If you have chlamydia when you're pregnant, it can pass to your baby during birth. There are some things you can do to avoid getting chlamydia and spreading it to others. Do use condoms when you have vaginal or anal sex use a condom to cover the penis, or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina, if you have oral sex get tested once a year, or if you have a new sexual partner complete the full treatment if you or your sexual partner have chlamydia Don’t do not share sex toys (if you do, wash and cover them with a new condom before anyone else uses them) Complications of chlamydia If chlamydia is not treated, it can lead to serious complications including: infection of the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries ( pelvic inflammatory disease ), which can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy infection in the testicles pain in your joints ( reactive arthritis ) which usually gets better after a few months The sooner you get treatment, the easier these complications are to treat. Chlamydia in pregnancy If you're pregnant and have chlamydia that is not treated, it can be passed onto your baby during birth. If this happens, it can cause an infection in your baby's eyes ( conjunctivitis ) or lungs ( pneumonia ). These infections can be treated with antibiotics.

    "title": "Acute cholecystitis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-cholecystitis/",
    "text": "Acute cholecystitis Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. It usually happens when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. The cystic duct is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones are very common, affecting more than 1 in 10 adults in the UK. They do not usually cause symptoms, but can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious because of the risk of complications. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with rest, intravenous fluids and antibiotics . Symptoms of acute cholecystitis The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the tummy is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike other types of abdominal pain , the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and does not go away within a few hours. Some people may have additional symptoms, such as: a high temperature feeling sick being sick sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the tummy When to get medical advice See a GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a high temperature. If you're unable to contact a GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice. It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, as there's a risk of serious complications developing if it's not treated promptly. What causes acute cholecystitis? The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. Calculous cholecystitis Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. An inflamed gallbladder can sometimes become infected by bacteria. Acalculous cholecystitis Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It's less common, but usually more serious, than calculous cholecystitis. The exact cause of acalculous cholecystitis is not known, but it's usually a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. A combination of risk factors may lead to acalculous cholecystitis, including accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns , sepsis , severe malnutrition or dehydration . Diagnosing acute cholecystitis If you have severe tummy pain, a GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with the GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand. If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests – to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your tummy – to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Treating acute cholecystitis If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Initial treatment Initial treatment will usually involve: not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medicine to relieve your pain You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home. Surgery Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis coming back and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy . There are 2 main types of cholecystectomy: open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy laparoscopic cholecystectomy – keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often recommended within 1 week of confirming acute cholecystitis. Some people who have had their gallbladder removed have symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, but it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Find out more about recovering from gallbladder removal Alternatives to surgery Sometimes surgery may not be an option – for example, if you have another condition that makes surgery unsuitable. If surgery is not an option, you may be offered a procedure to drain away the fluid that has collected in your gallbladder. A narrow tube is inserted into the gallbladder to make an opening for the fluid to drain. This can be done through a cut made in the skin of your tummy, or using an endoscopic procedure (through your mouth and into the stomach). Possible complications Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) – which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) – which can spread the infection within your tummy (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about 2 or 3 in every 10 cases of acute cholecystitis. Preventing acute cholecystitis It's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones. One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Living with overweight or obesity also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly . But low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best. Find out more about preventing gallstones The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. It's an organ that's useful, but not essential, and it can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.

Common symptoms may include: a watery, smelly, discharge that comes out of the ear a gradual loss of hearing in the affected ear pain in the affected ear Cholesteatoma can also cause: ear infections that keep coming back vertigo tinnitus damage to the facial nerve Rarely, a cholesteatoma infection can cause a brain abscess or meningitis . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you’re having problems with your hearing the discharge coming from your ear does not go away after taking prescribed antibiotics you have ear pain for more than 3 days that does not go away Immediate action required: Call 999 now if: somebody's face droops on 1 side (their mouth or eye may have drooped) a person cannot lift up both arms and keep them there a person has difficulty speaking (speech may be slurred or garbled) These can be signs of a stroke, which is a medical emergency. What happens at your appointment If you have symptoms of cholesteatoma, a GP will examine the inside of your ear. If they think you have an infection caused by a cholesteatoma, they may give you ear drops. You may then be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for more tests, including a CT scan . If they think your symptoms are caused by a bacterial ear infection, they can treat you. Treatment for cholesteatoma You'll usually have surgery in hospital to remove a cholesteatoma. Surgery involves removing the build-up of dead skin cells while you're under general anaesthetic . You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay in hospital overnight. If there are any problems, you may have to stay in hospital for longer. If a cholesteatoma affects your hearing, surgery may help to improve it. Surgery does not always help, however, and your hearing may stay the same or, possibly, get worse. You may have stitches and packing in your ear to stop any bleeding. These will be removed after a few weeks. Most people take 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover after surgery, but you’ll still need long-term follow-up care to check there are no problems. If surgery did not completely remove the cholesteatoma, you may need another procedure. Recovery after surgery It may take some time to fully recover from cholesteatoma surgery and it can be painful. You may be advised not to work for 1 to 2 weeks or longer. There are things you can do to help your ear get better. Do keep the affected ear dry when showering plug your ear with a small piece of Vaseline-coated cotton wool if you wash your hair check with the surgeon first if you need to travel by plane following surgery try to keep your mouth open if you sneeze Don’t do not swim for at least 6 weeks after surgery, if you can avoid it do not blow your nose after surgery – the surgeon will tell you when it's OK to do so again, but you can sniff if you need to If you have any problems after surgery, speak to a GP. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you have: discharge or a lot of bleeding from your ear or wound a high temperature severe or increasing pain Call 111 or get help from 111 online . If you have any of these symptoms, it may be a sign of an infection. Causes of a cholesteatoma A cholesteatoma can develop if your eardrum is damaged through injury, infection or after any kind of ear surgery. You can also be born with a cholesteatoma, but this is rare. Page last reviewed: 20 February 2025 Next review due: 20 February 2028"

CKD can be caused by: high blood pressure – over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly kidney infections glomerulonephritis – kidney inflammation autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease – an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys blockages in the flow of urine – for example, from kidney stones that keep coming back, or an enlarged prostate long-term, regular use of certain medicines – such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) You can help prevent CKD by making healthy lifestyle changes and ensuring any underlying conditions you have are well controlled. Tests for CKD CKD can be diagnosed using blood and urine tests. These tests look for high levels of certain substances in your blood and urine that are signs your kidneys are not working properly. If you're at a high risk of developing kidney disease (for example, you have a known risk factor such as high blood pressure or diabetes), you may be advised to have regular tests to check for CKD so it's found at an early stage. The results of your blood and urine tests can be used to tell the stage of your kidney disease. This is a number that reflects how severe the damage to your kidneys is, with a higher number indicating more serious CKD. Find out more about how CKD is diagnosed . Treatments for CKD There's no cure for CKD, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse. Your treatment will depend on how severe your condition is. The main treatments are: lifestyle changes to help you remain as healthy as possible medicine to control associated problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol dialysis – treatment to replicate some of the kidney's functions; this may be necessary in advanced CKD kidney transplant – this may also be necessary in advanced CKD You'll also be advised to have regular check-ups to monitor your condition. Find out more about how CKD is treated and living with CKD . Outlook for CKD CKD can range from a mild condition with no or few symptoms, to a very serious condition where the kidneys stop working, sometimes called kidney failure. Most people with CKD will be able to control their condition with medicine and regular check-ups. CKD only progresses to kidney failure in around 2 in 100 people with the condition. If you have CKD, even if it's mild, you're at an increased risk of developing other serious problems, such as cardiovascular disease . This is a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, which includes heart attack and stroke . Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in people with kidney disease, although healthy lifestyle changes and medicine can help reduce your risk of developing it. Want to know more?

    "text": "Overview - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. It includes: emphysema – damage to the air sacs in the lungs chronic bronchitis – long-term inflammation of the airways COPD is a common condition that mainly affects middle-aged or older adults who smoke. Many people do not realise they have it. The breathing problems tend to get gradually worse over time and can limit your normal activities, although treatment can help keep the condition under control. Symptoms of COPD The main symptoms of COPD are: shortness of breath , particularly when you're active a persistent chesty cough with phlegm – some people may dismiss this as just a \"smoker's cough\" frequent chest infections persistent wheezing Without treatment, the symptoms usually get progressively worse. There may also be periods when they get suddenly worse, known as a flare-up or exacerbation. Find out more about the symptoms of COPD . When to get medical advice See a GP if you have persistent symptoms of COPD, particularly if you're over 35 and smoke or used to smoke. Do not ignore the symptoms. If they're caused by COPD, it's best to start treatment as soon as possible, before your lungs become significantly damaged. The GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you smoke or have smoked in the past. They can organise a breathing test to help diagnose COPD and rule out other lung conditions, such as asthma . Find out more about how COPD is diagnosed . Causes of COPD COPD happens when the lungs become inflamed, damaged and narrowed. The main cause is smoking, although the condition can sometimes affect people who have never smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've smoked. Some cases of COPD are caused by long-term exposure to harmful fumes or dust. Others are the result of a rare genetic problem that makes the lungs more vulnerable to damage. Find out more about the causes of COPD . Treatments for COPD The damage to the lungs caused by COPD is permanent, but treatment can help slow down the progression of the condition. Treatments include: stopping smoking – if you have COPD and you smoke, this is the most important thing you can do inhalers and medicines – to help make breathing easier pulmonary rehabilitation – a specialised programme of exercise and education surgery or a lung transplant – although this is only an option for a very small number of people Find out more about how COPD is treated and living with COPD . Outlook for COPD The outlook for COPD varies from person to person. The condition cannot be cured or reversed, but for many people, treatment can help keep it under control so it does not severely limit their daily activities. But in some people, COPD may continue to get worse despite treatment, eventually having a significant impact on their quality of life and leading to life-threatening problems.

    "title": "Overview-Chronic pancreatitis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-pancreatitis/",
    "text": "Overview - Chronic pancreatitis Contents Overview Treatment Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas has become permanently damaged from inflammation and stops working properly. The pancreas is a small organ, located behind the stomach, that helps with digestion. Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age. It is more common in men. It's different from acute pancreatitis , where the inflammation is only short term. Most people with chronic pancreatitis have had 1 or more attacks of acute pancreatitis. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of severe pain in your tummy (abdomen). The pain usually develops in the middle or left side of your tummy and can move along your back. It's been described as a burning or shooting pain that comes and goes, but may last for several hours or days. Although the pain sometimes comes on after eating a meal, there's often no trigger. Some people might feel sick and vomit. As the condition progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe. Eventually, a constant dull pain can develop in your tummy, between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Some people who stop drinking alcohol and stop smoking may find the pain is less severe. Advanced chronic pancreatitis Other symptoms develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses and it becomes unable to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food. The absence of digestive juices means it's harder to break down fats and some proteins. This can cause your poo to become very smelly and greasy, and make it difficult to flush down the toilet. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the first symptoms started. You may also experience: weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) symptoms of diabetes – such as feeling very thirsty, needing to pee more often than usual and feeling very tired ongoing nausea and sickness (vomiting) When to get medical advice See a GP immediately if you're experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong. If this is not possible, contact NHS 111 for advice. You should also see a GP as soon as you can if: your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow (jaundice) you keep being sick Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it's usually a sign there's something wrong with your digestive system. Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis A GP will ask about your symptoms and may examine you. They'll refer you to a specialist for further tests if they think you have chronic pancreatitis. The specialist will be able to confirm whether you have the condition. Tests Tests and scans are usually carried out in your local hospital. They may include: an ultrasound scan – where sound waves are used to create a picture of your pancreas a CT scan – where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed 3D image of your pancreas an endoscopic ultrasound scan – where a long, thin tube containing a camera is passed through your mouth and down into your stomach to take pictures of your pancreas magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) – a type of MRI scan that takes a detailed image of your pancreas and the organs around it Biopsy Sometimes the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar to pancreatic cancer. You may need a biopsy , where a small sample of cells is taken from the pancreas and sent to a laboratory to be checked, to rule this out. Causes of chronic pancreatitis The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years. This can cause repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis , which results in increasing damage to the organ. Find out more about alcohol misuse In children the most common cause is cystic fibrosis . Less common causes include: smoking the immune system attacking the pancreas (autoimmune chronic pancreatitis) inheriting a faulty gene that stops the pancreas working properly injury to the pancreas gallstones blocking the openings (ducts) of the pancreas radiotherapy to the tummy In some cases, no cause can be identified. This is called idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. Treatment for chronic pancreatitis The damage to the pancreas is permanent, but treatment can help control the condition and manage any symptoms. People with chronic pancreatitis are usually advised to make lifestyle changes, such as stopping drinking alcohol and stopping smoking. They're also given medicine to relieve pain. Surgery may also be an option for those experiencing severe pain. Complications Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. See a GP if you're experiencing stress , anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis. Some people with chronic pancreatitis will eventually develop a type of diabetes known as type 3c diabetes. This occurs when the pancreas can no longer produce insulin because it's become so damaged. People with chronic pancreatitis can sometimes develop sacs of fluid on the surface of their pancreas (pseudocysts). These can cause bloating, indigestion and dull tummy pain. These cysts often disappear on their own. But sometimes they need to be drained using a technique called endoscopic ultrasound drainage, or endoscopic transpapillary drainage. Chronic pancreatitis increases your risk of pancreatic cancer , although the chance is still small. Support for people living with chronic pancreatitis Any long-term health condition, particularly one that causes recurring episodes of pain or constant pain, can affect your emotional and psychological health. See a GP if you're experiencing psychological and emotional difficulties. There are medicines available that can help with stress, anxiety and depression. Talking to other people with the same condition can often reduce feelings of isolation and stress. The charity Guts UK , may be able to put you in touch with a support group.

    "text": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain condition thought to be linked to repeated head injuries and blows to the head. It slowly gets worse over time and leads to dementia, but the right help and support can manage the symptoms. Symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) Early symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy may not be noticeable at first. They may include: mood changes, such as depression or suicidal thoughts personality changes behaviour changes, such as aggression and mood swings As the condition gets worse, you'll have more noticeable problems with thinking and memory. Symptoms include: short-term memory loss confusion, such as getting lost or not knowing what time of day it is difficulties with planning and organisation problems with movement Symptoms usually start gradually, often around 10 years after having repeated head injuries. The symptoms may get worse gradually or stay the same for years before getting worse. Important These symptoms can be caused by many different conditions. Having them does not definitely mean you have CTE. But it's important to get them checked by a GP. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) What happens at your GP appointment If you have symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a GP will ask you about your symptoms and if you've played a lot of contact sports in the past or have had several head injuries or concussions. They may also: ask you to do simple tasks such as moving or walking around do tests to check your memory and thinking arrange blood or urine tests to check for other conditions that could be causing your symptoms You may be referred to a specialist at a memory assessment service. These clinics help diagnose and care for people with dementia. But you may not be formally diagnosed with CTE as this can only be done once you've died. Information: Find out more Tests for diagnosing dementia Causes of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) If you've had repeated blows to the head or concussions over many years, you may have a higher chance of getting chronic traumatic encephalopathy. You're most at risk if you: regularly played contact sports, such as boxing, martial arts, football, rugby and American football served in the military and have had blast injuries have been physically assaulted often, such as from domestic violence Anyone who's had repeated head injuries is at risk, but not everyone will get it. It's thought the only way to lower your risk of getting CTE is to avoid repeated head injuries. For example, you can do this by wearing the correct protective equipment for any sports you play and making sure head injuries are treated properly. Treatments for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) cannot be cured, but medicines and other treatments can help your symptoms. If it's thought you have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the support you'll have is similar to the help given to people with dementia. For example: physiotherapy if you have difficulties with movement occupational therapy for help with things like getting dressed or adapting your home to your needs speech and language therapy for help with things like memory, speech, and difficulty eating and drinking You'll be seen by a group of specialists, including a GP, a dementia care specialist and social care services. The specialists involved in your care will work together to give you a care plan for your long-term care.

    "text": "Overview - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time. Symptoms of CJD Symptoms of CJD include: loss of intellect and memory changes in personality loss of balance and co-ordination slurred speech vision problems and blindness abnormal jerking movements progressive loss of brain function and mobility Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection. This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection. Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . What causes CJD? CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria. For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them. Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Types of CJD There are 4 main types of CJD. Sporadic CJD Sporadic CJD is the most common type. The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (\"misfolds\") and turns into a prion. Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65. Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK. In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK. Variant CJD Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD. Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain. See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information. But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear. The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD. The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion , although this has only happened 5 times in the UK. In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK. Familial or inherited CJD Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD. It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK. The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s. In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK. Iatrogenic CJD Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment. For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD. Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk. Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person. But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare. In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985. How CJD is treated There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible. This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression , and painkillers to relieve pain. Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding. Read more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Variant CJD compensation scheme In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD. The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families. Page last reviewed: 07 September 2021 Next review due: 07 September 2024 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Overview - Cleft lip and palate Contents Overview Treatment A cleft is a gap or split in the upper lip and/or roof of the mouth (palate). It is present from birth. The gap is there because parts of the baby's face did not join together properly during development in the womb. What does a cleft lip and palate look like? Babies can be born with a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both. A cleft lip may just affect one side of the lip or there may be 2 clefts. Credit: DR M.A. ANSARY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/266603/view It can range from a small notch to a wide gap that reaches the nose. A cleft palate may just be an opening at the back of the mouth, or it may be a split in the palate that runs all the way to the front of the mouth. Credit: MORRIS HUBERLAND/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/95507/view Sometimes it can be hidden by the lining of the roof of the mouth. The Cleft Lip and Palate Association has pictures of children with cleft lips and palates before and after surgery Problems related to cleft lip and palate A cleft lip and cleft palate can cause a number of issues, particularly in the first few months after birth, before surgery is done. Problems can include: difficulty feeding – a baby with a cleft lip and palate may be unable to breastfeed or feed from a normal bottle because they cannot form a good seal with their mouth hearing problems – some babies with a cleft palate are more vulnerable to ear infections and a build-up of fluid in their ears (glue ear) , which may affect their hearing dental problems – a cleft lip and palate can mean a child's teeth do not develop correctly and they may be at a higher risk of tooth decay speech problems – if a cleft palate is not repaired, it can lead to speech problems such as unclear or nasal-sounding speech when a child is older Most of these problems will improve after surgery and with treatments such as speech and language therapy. Causes of cleft lip and palate A cleft lip or palate happens when the structures that form the upper lip or palate fail to join together when a baby is developing in the womb. The exact reason why this happens to some babies is often unclear. It's very unlikely to have been caused by anything you did or did not do during pregnancy. In a few cases, cleft lip and palate is associated with: the genes a child inherits from their parents (although most cases are a one-off) smoking in pregnancy or drinking alcohol while pregnant obesity during pregnancy a lack of folic acid during pregnancy taking certain medicines in early pregnancy, such as some anti-seizure medicines In some cases, a cleft lip or palate can occur as part of a condition that causes a wider range of birth defects, such as 22q11 deletion syndrome (sometimes called DiGeorge or velocardiofacial syndrome) and Pierre Robin sequence. The Cleft Lip and Palate Association has more information on Pierre Robin sequence Diagnosing cleft lip and palate A cleft lip is usually picked up during the 20-week screening scan done when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant. Not all cleft lips will be obvious on this scan and it's very difficult to detect a cleft palate on an ultrasound scan. If a cleft lip or palate does not show up on the scan, it's usually diagnosed immediately after birth or during the newborn physical examination done within 72 hours of birth. When a cleft lip or palate is diagnosed, you'll be referred to a specialist NHS cleft team who will explain your child's condition, discuss the treatments they need and answer any questions you have. You may also find it useful to contact a support group, such as the Cleft Lip and Palate Association , who can offer advice and put you in touch with parents in a similar situation. Treatments for cleft lip and palate Cleft lip and cleft palate are treated at specialist NHS cleft centres. Your child will usually have a long-term care plan that outlines the treatments and assessments they'll need as they grow up. The main treatments are: surgery – an operation to correct a cleft lip is usually done when your baby is 3 to 6 months and an operation to repair a cleft palate is usually done at 6 to 12 months feeding support – you may need advice about positioning your baby on your breast to help them feed, or you might need to feed them using a special type of bottle monitoring hearing – a baby born with cleft palate has a higher chance of glue ear, which may affect hearing. Close monitoring of their hearing is important and if glue ear affects their hearing significantly, a hearing aid may be fitted or small tubes called grommets may be placed in their ears to drain the fluid speech and language therapy – a speech and language therapist will monitor your child's speech and language development throughout their childhood and help with any speech and language problems good dental hygiene and orthodontic treatment – you'll be given advice about looking after your child's teeth , and they may need braces if their adult teeth don't come through properly Read more about how cleft lip and palate is treated Outlook for cleft lip and palate The majority of children treated for cleft lip or palate grow up to have completely normal lives. Most affected children will not have any other serious medical problems and treatment can usually improve the appearance of the face and problems with feeding and speech. Surgery to repair a cleft lip may leave a small pink scar above the lips. This will fade over time and become less noticeable as your child gets older. Credit: Maos / Thinkstock https://www.istockphoto.com/gb/photo/baby-with-cleft-before-and-after-surgery-gm520421636-90969427 Will a cleft lip and palate happen again? Most cases of cleft lip or palate are a one-off and it's unlikely you'll have another child with the condition. The risk of having a child with a cleft lip or palate is slightly increased if you've had a child with the condition before, but the chances of this happening are thought to be around 2 to 8%. If either you or your partner were born with a cleft lip or palate, your chance of having a baby with a cleft is also around 2 to 8%. The chances of another child being born with a cleft or of a parent passing the condition to their child can be higher in cases related to a genetic condition. For example, a parent with 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome) has a 1 in 2 chance of passing the condition to their child. Information about your child If your child has a cleft lip or palate, your cleft team will pass information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a type of bacteria that can cause diarrhoea. It often affects people who have been taking antibiotics. It can usually be treated with a different type of antibiotic. Symptoms of a C. diff infection Common symptoms of a C. diff infection include: diarrhoea a high temperature loss of appetite feeling sick a stomach ache How you get a C. diff infection C. diff bacteria usually live harmlessly in your bowel along with lots of other types of bacteria. But sometimes when you take antibiotics, the balance of bacteria in your bowel can change, causing an infection. When someone has a C. diff infection, it can spread to other people very easily if the bacteria found in the person’s poo get onto objects and surfaces. Who's at risk You're more likely to get a C. diff infection if: you're over 65 years you're taking, or have recently taken, antibiotics you're staying in hospital or a care home for a long time you have a weakened immune system – for example, from having a long-term condition like diabetes or kidney failure, or treatment like chemotherapy you're taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), such as omeprazole , or other medicines that reduce stomach acid you've had a C. diff infection in the past Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have diarrhoea and you're taking, or have recently taken, antibiotics you have bloody diarrhoea or bleeding from the bottom you have diarrhoea for more than 7 days You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatments for a C. diff infection If a doctor thinks you have a C. diff infection, they may ask for a sample of your poo to be tested. The infection can sometimes be treated at home, or you might need to go into hospital. This is because C. diff infections can sometimes lead to more serious problems like sepsis . A C. diff infection is treated by: stopping any antibiotics you're taking, if possible taking a 10-day course of another antibiotic that can treat the C. diff infection You'll also be given advice about how to avoid dehydration, such as making sure you drink plenty of water. Your symptoms should improve a few days after starting the new course of antibiotics. But it may be 1 to 2 weeks before the infection clears up completely. Go back to see the GP if your symptoms get worse, you feel very unwell after starting the antibiotics, or your symptoms come back afterwards. If your symptoms return, treatment may need to be repeated. If the C. diff infection comes back 2 or more times, you may be offered a faecal microbiota transplant. This is where bacteria from a healthy person's poo is put into your gut to help stop the infection. Important Carry on taking your antibiotics until you've finished all your tablets, capsules or liquid, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, your symptoms could come back. How to prevent spreading a C. diff infection C. diff infections can spread very easily. There are some things you can do to reduce the risk of passing it on to others. Do stay at home until at least 48 hours after your diarrhoea stops wash your hands regularly using soap and water clean the toilet and area around it with disinfectant after each use wash clothes and sheets with poo on separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature Don’t do not share towels and flannels do not take medicine to stop diarrhoea like loperamide because it can prevent the infection being cleared from your body Page last reviewed: 08 February 2022 Next review due: 08 February 2025"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/club-foot/",
    "text": "Club foot Club foot (also called talipes) is where a baby is born with a foot or feet that turn in and under. Early treatment should correct it. In club foot, 1 foot or both feet point down and inwards with the sole of the foot facing backwards. Credit: DR M.A. ANSARY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/266601/view Club foot happens because the Achilles tendon (the large tendon at the back of the ankle) is too short. Club foot can affect 1 or both feet. It's not painful for babies, but it can become painful and make it difficult to walk if it's not treated. Club foot affects about 1 baby in every 1,000 born in the UK. Both feet are affected in about half of these babies. It's more common in boys. Diagnosing club foot Club foot is usually diagnosed after a baby is born, although it may be spotted during the routine ultrasound scan done between 18 and 21 weeks. Diagnosing club foot during pregnancy means you can talk to doctors and find out what to expect after your baby is born. Some babies are born with normal feet that are in an unusual position because they have been squashed in the womb. The feet usually correct themselves by 3 months, but some babies may need a few sessions of physiotherapy. Treating club foot Treatment for club foot usually starts within 1 to 2 weeks of your baby being born. The main treatment, called the Ponseti method, involves gently manipulating and stretching your baby's foot into a better position. It's then put into a cast. This is repeated every week for about 5 to 8 weeks. After the last cast comes off, most babies need a minor operation to loosen the Achilles tendon at the back of their ankle. This is done using a local anaesthetic . It helps to release their foot into a more natural position. Your baby will need to wear special boots attached to each other with a bar to prevent the club foot returning. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/266619/view They'll need to wear these all the time for the first 3 months, then overnight until they're 4 or 5 years old. Outcome Nearly all children with club foot are treated successfully. Most should be able to take part in regular daily activities. They will learn to walk at the usual age, enjoy physical activities and be able to wear regular footwear after treatment. Children who only have 1 affected foot may be left with a slightly shorter leg and a smaller foot. This may mean your child is slightly less mobile and gets tired more quickly than other children. Relapses Sometimes club foot can come back, especially if treatment is not followed exactly. If it comes back, some of the treatment stages may need to be repeated. Causes of club foot In most cases the cause of club foot is not known. There may be a genetic link, as it can run in families. If you have a child with a club foot or feet, your chance of having a 2nd child with the condition is about 1 in 35. If 1 parent has a club foot, there's about a 1 in 30 chance of your baby having it. If both parents have the condition, this increases to about a 1 in 3 chance. In rare cases, club foot is linked to more serious conditions, such as spina bifida .

Steps Charity Worldwide website Steps Charity Worldwide helpline: 01925 750271 Email: info@steps-charity.org.uk National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS) If your child has club foot, your clinical team will register the details of this with NCARDRS.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coeliac-disease/",
    "text": "Overview - Coeliac disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Coeliac disease is a condition where your immune system attacks your own tissues when you eat gluten. This damages your gut (small intestine) so your body cannot properly take in nutrients. Coeliac disease can cause a range of symptoms, including diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating. Coeliac disease is caused by an adverse reaction to gluten, which is a dietary protein found in 3 types of cereal: wheat barley rye Gluten is found in any food that contains those cereals, including: pasta cakes breakfast cereals most types of bread certain types of sauces some ready meals In addition, most beers are made with barley. Symptoms of coeliac disease Eating foods that contain gluten can trigger a range of gut symptoms, such as: diarrhoea , which may smell particularly unpleasant stomach aches bloating and farting (flatulence) indigestion constipation Coeliac disease can also cause more general symptoms, including: tiredness (fatigue) as a result of not getting enough nutrients from food ( malnutrition ) unintentional weight loss an itchy rash (dermatitis herpetiformis) problems getting pregnant (infertility) nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy ) disorders that affect co-ordination, balance and speech ( ataxia ) Children with coeliac disease may not grow at the expected rate and may have delayed puberty . What causes coeliac disease? Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system (the body's defence against infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body's ability to take in nutrients from food. It's not entirely clear what causes the immune system to act this way, but a combination of genetics and the environment appear to play a part. Treating coeliac disease There's no cure for coeliac disease, but following a gluten-free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term complications of the condition. Even if you have mild symptoms, changing your diet is still recommended because continuing to eat gluten can lead to serious complications. This may also be the case if tests show that you have some degree of coeliac disease even if you do not have noticeable symptoms. It's important to ensure that your gluten-free diet is healthy and balanced. An increase in the range of available gluten-free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet. Complications of coeliac disease Complications of coeliac disease only tend to affect people who continue to eat gluten, or those who have not yet been diagnosed with the condition, which can be a common problem in milder cases. Potential long-term complications include: weakening of the bones ( osteoporosis ) iron deficiency anaemia vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Less common and more serious complications include some types of cancers, such as bowel cancer , and problems affecting pregnancy, such as your baby having a low birth weight. Find out more about the complications of coeliac disease . Who's affected Coeliac disease is a condition that affects at least 1 in every 100 people in the UK. But some experts think this may be underestimated because milder cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as other digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . Reported cases of coeliac disease are higher in women than men. It can develop at any age. People with certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes , autoimmune thyroid disease, Down's syndrome and Turner syndrome , have an increased risk of getting coeliac disease. First-degree relatives (parents, brothers, sisters and children) of people with coeliac disease are also at increased risk of developing the condition. Diagnosing coeliac disease Routine testing for coeliac disease is not done in England. Testing is usually only recommended for people who have symptoms, or who have an increased risk of developing coeliac disease, such as those with a family history of the condition. First-degree relatives of people with coeliac disease should be tested. Read about diagnosing coeliac disease for more information about when testing for coeliac disease should be done. Help and support Coeliac UK is a UK charity for people with coeliac disease. Its website has useful resources, including information about a gluten-free diet, local groups, volunteering and ongoing campaigns. You can also call the Coeliac UK helpline 0333 332 2033, open Monday to Friday from 10am to 4pm. Page last reviewed: 31 March 2023 Next review due: 31 March 2026 Next : Symptoms"

They can easily spread to other people and other parts of your body. To help stop cold sores spreading: wash your hands with soap and water whenever you touch your cold sore do not kiss anyone while you have a cold sore do not have oral sex until your cold sore completely heals as you could give your partner genital herpes Important Kissing a baby if you have a cold sore can lead to neonatal herpes , which is very dangerous to newborn babies.

Do avoid anything that triggers your cold sores, such as sunbeds use sunblock lip balm (SPF 15 or above) if you're outside in the sun take paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease pain and swelling ( liquid paracetamol is available for children ) – do not give aspirin to children under 16 drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration Don’t do not touch your cold sore (apart from applying antiviral cream) – and if you do wash your hands before and after do not rub cream into the cold sore – dab it on instead do not eat acidic or salty food if it makes your cold sore feel worse Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: a cold sore has not started to heal within 10 days you're worried about a cold sore or think it's something else the cold sore is very large or painful you or your child also have swollen, painful gums and sores in the mouth (gingivostomatitis) you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of chemotherapy or diabetes Treatment for cold sores from a GP A GP may prescribe antiviral tablets if your cold sores are very large, painful or keep coming back. Newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system may be referred to hospital for advice or treatment. Why cold sores come back Cold sores are caused by a virus called herpes simplex. Most people are exposed to the virus when they're children after close skin to skin contact, such as kissing, with someone who has a cold sore. Once you have the virus, it stays in your skin for the rest of your life. Sometimes it causes a cold sore. Page last reviewed: 19 February 2024 Next review due: 19 February 2027"

Tests are available online, but it's important to get checked at an opticians if you have concerns about your vision. Information: NHS eye tests NHS eye tests are free for some people including: children aged under 18, or under 19 and in full-time education people who have diabetes or glaucoma people on some benefits, including Universal Credit Find out more about free NHS eye tests If you or your child has been diagnosed with colour vision deficiency People usually adapt well to life with colour vision deficiency. It may affect your child's performance at school. Tell your child's school if they have colour vision deficiency. The school may be able to make adjustments for your child's lessons and exams. Having colour vision deficiency may mean you're unable to do certain careers for safety reasons, such as being a pilot or train driver.

It can be passed on in families and some people are born with it. Colour vision deficiency can also sometimes be caused by: eye conditions, such as glaucoma other conditions such as diabetes, liver disease and multiple sclerosis an eye or head injury a stroke taking certain medicines Treatment for colour vision deficiency There is currently no treatment for colour vision deficiency that runs in families. Most people adapt to seeing colours differently. If your colour vision has been affected by an underlying medical condition or by medicines, getting treatment for the condition or changing medicines may help.

    "text": "Common cold You can often treat a cold without seeing a GP. You should begin to feel better in about 1 to 2 weeks. Symptoms of a cold Cold symptoms come on gradually over 2 to 3 days. The main symptoms include: a blocked or runny nose sneezing a sore throat a hoarse voice a cough feeling tired and unwell You may also have: a high temperature aching muscles a loss of taste and smell a feeling of pressure in your ears and face Symptoms of a cold can last longer in young children. They may also be irritable, have difficulty feeding and sleeping, breathe through their mouth, and get sick after coughing. Telling the difference between cold and flu Cold and flu symptoms are similar, but flu tends to be more severe. Difference between cold and flu Cold Flu Appears gradually Appears quickly within a few hours Affects mainly your nose and throat Affects more than just your nose and throat Makes you feel unwell, but you're OK to carry on as normal (for example, you can normally go to work) Makes you feel exhausted and too unwell to carry on as normal How you can treat a cold yourself You can usually treat a cold at home without seeing a GP. There are things you can do to help you get better more quickly. Do get plenty of rest drink lots of fluid, such as water, to avoid dehydration eat healthy food (it's common for small children to lose their appetite for a few days) gargle salt water to soothe a sore throat (not suitable for children) drink a hot lemon and honey drink to soothe a sore throat breathe in steam to ease a blocked nose – try sitting in the bathroom with a hot shower running Don’t do not let children breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water because of the risk of scalding do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16 do not smoke as it can make your symptoms worse How to make a hot lemon and honey drink Squeeze half a lemon into a mug of boiled water Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey Drink while still warm Do not give hot drinks to small children. Do not give honey to children under 12 months old. If you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better. A pharmacist can help with cold medicines You can buy cough and cold medicines from pharmacies or supermarkets. A pharmacist can advise you on the best medicine, such as: medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease aches or lower a temperature decongestant nasal sprays, drops or tablets to unblock your nose (decongestants should not be used by children under 6) vapour rubs to help ease chesty coughs in babies and small children You can buy nasal sprays without a prescription, but they should not be used for more than a week as this can make your symptoms worse. Do not use other cough and cold medicines if you're also taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets as you may take more medicine than you should. Some cough and cold medicines are also not suitable for babies, children and pregnant women. There's little evidence that supplements such as vitamin C, echinacea or garlic prevent colds or help you get better more quickly. Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have a high temperature for more than 3 days your cold symptoms get worse your temperature is very high or you feel hot and shivery you feel short of breath or have chest pain you're worried about your child's cold symptoms your cold symptoms do not get better after 10 days you have a cough for more than 3 weeks you get cold symptoms and you have a long-term medical condition (for example, diabetes, or a heart, lung or kidney condition) you get cold symptoms and you have a weakened immune system (for example, because you're having chemotherapy) Information: GPs do not recommend antibiotics for colds because they will not relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery. Antibiotics only work if you have a bacterial infection, but colds are caused by viruses. How to avoid spreading a cold Colds are caused by viruses and easily spread to other people. You're infectious until all your symptoms have gone. This usually takes 1 to 2 weeks. It can be longer in babies and young children. Colds are spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours. To reduce the risk of spreading a cold: wash your hands often with warm water and soap use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze bin used tissues as quickly as possible How to prevent catching a cold A person with a cold can start spreading it from a few days before their symptoms begin until the symptoms have finished. The best ways to avoid catching a cold are: washing your hands with warm water and soap not sharing towels or household items (like cups or children's toys) with someone who has a cold not touching your eyes or nose in case you've come into contact with the virus staying fit and healthy The flu vaccine does not prevent colds.

    "title": "Compartment syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/compartment-syndrome/",
    "text": "Compartment syndrome Compartment syndrome is an increase in pressure inside a muscle, which restricts blood flow and causes pain. If it happens suddenly, it can be serious and need treatment as soon as possible. Symptoms of compartment syndrome You can get compartment syndrome in any muscle, but it most often affects the muscles in the lower legs and forearms. Symptoms include: pain in a muscle – this may feel like a burning pain or a deep ache (moving the body part can make the pain even worse) swelling or bulging of the muscle numbness, weakness or pins and needles tightness or difficulty moving the affected body part The symptoms can start suddenly, such as after an injury or if a bandage or plaster cast is too tight. This is called acute compartment syndrome. Symptoms can also come on gradually after exercising and go away when you rest. This is called chronic compartment syndrome. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have sudden, severe pain in any part of your body If compartment syndrome is causing the pain, you’ll need surgery to treat it as soon as possible. Find your nearest A&E What we mean by severe pain Severe pain: always there and so bad it's hard to think or talk you cannot sleep it's very hard to move, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash or dress Moderate pain: always there makes it hard to concentrate or sleep you can manage to get up, wash or dress Mild pain: comes and goes is annoying but does not stop you doing daily activities Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you keep getting pain, numbness, swelling, or have difficulty moving a part of your body when you exercise A GP can help find out if the pain is caused by compartment syndrome or another condition. Tests for compartment syndrome If the GP thinks you may have compartment syndrome, you may be referred to a specialist for tests. Tests you may have include: an X-ray to check if you’ve broken a bone MRI scans while you’re resting and while you’re exercising compartment pressure measurement – a needle connected to a pressure monitoring device is inserted into your muscle before and after exercise to measure the pressure inside it Measuring the pressure inside a muscle is usually only recommended if your symptoms and other test results suggest compartment syndrome. Treatments for compartment syndrome Treatment for compartment syndrome depends on whether it happens suddenly or comes on gradually. Sudden (acute) compartment syndrome If compartment syndrome happens suddenly, you’ll need surgery as soon as possible to relieve the pressure in the muscle. This type of surgery is called a fasciotomy. During a fasciotomy, the surgeon makes cuts around the muscle to relieve the pressure. Sometimes, skin may need to be removed from another part of the body and used to cover the wound. This is known as a skin graft. After the operation, you’ll have medicine to help ease any pain. You may also need physiotherapy to help regain full movement in the affected part of your body. Gradual (chronic) compartment syndrome Treatment is often not needed for compartment syndrome that develops gradually. To help relieve your symptoms you can: avoid the activity that caused them – if you run, switching to a low-impact exercise, such as cycling, may help use anti-inflammatory painkillers to reduce the pain and discomfort have physiotherapy use inserts (orthotics) in your shoes if you start running again If your symptoms do not improve after trying these things, surgery may be an option. The operation is similar to the one used to treat acute compartment syndrome. Page last reviewed: 09 February 2023 Next review due: 09 February 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Complex regional pain syndrome Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a poorly understood condition where a person experiences persistent severe and debilitating pain. Although most cases of CRPS are triggered by an injury, the resulting pain is much more severe and long-lasting than normal. The pain usually only affects 1 limb, but it can sometimes spread to other parts of the body. The skin of the affected body part can become so sensitive that a slight touch, bump or even a change in temperature can cause intense pain. Affected areas can also become swollen, stiff or undergo fluctuating changes in colour or temperature. CRPS often gradually improves over time. But some people with CRPS experience pain for many years. Find out more about the symptoms of CRPS . When to get medical advice You should see a GP if you have persistent pain that's preventing you from carrying out everyday activities. Diagnosing CRPS can be difficult because it involves having tests to rule out other possible causes. It's best to get help as soon as possible, as early treatment may help reduce your painful symptoms. Find out more about diagnosing CRPS . Causes of CRPS The cause of CRPS is unknown, but for many people it's thought to be the result of the body reacting abnormally to an injury. Find out more about the possible causes of CRPS . Who's affected It's difficult to estimate exactly how common CRPS is, as many cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed. But it's thought to be fairly uncommon. CRPS can affect people of any age, including children. It tends to be more common in women than men. Treating CRPS There's currently no cure for CRPS, but there are a number of treatments that can help manage the symptoms. There are 4 main types of treatment: education and self-management – being given clear information about your condition and advice on any steps you can take to help manage it yourself physical rehabilitation – treatment to help manage your symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term physical problems, such as physiotherapy exercises pain relief – treatments to help reduce your pain, such as anticonvulsants or antidepressants psychological support – treatments to help you cope with the emotional impact of living with CRPS, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) Because of the complex nature of CRPS, a number of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care.

    "text": "Overview - Congenital heart disease Contents Overview Types Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Prevention Congenital heart disease is a general term for a range of birth defects that affect the normal way the heart works. The term \"congenital\" means the condition is present from birth. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common types of birth defect, affecting almost 1 in 100 babies born in the UK. Why it happens In most cases, no obvious cause of congenital heart disease is identified. However, some things are known to increase the risk of the condition, including: Down's syndrome – a genetic disorder that affects a baby's normal physical development and causes learning difficulties the mother having certain infections, such as rubella , during pregnancy the mother taking certain types of medicine during pregnancy, including statins and some acne medicines the mother smoking or drinking alcohol during pregnancy the mother having poorly controlled type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes other chromosome defects, where genes may be altered from normal and can be inherited (run in the family) Read more about the causes of congenital heart disease and preventing congenital heart disease . Many cases of congenital heart disease are diagnosed before a baby is born during an ultrasound scan in pregnancy . However, it's not always possible to detect congenital heart defects in this way. Signs and symptoms Congenital heart disease can have a number of symptoms, particularly in babies and children, including: rapid heartbeat rapid breathing swelling of the legs, tummy or around the eyes extreme tiredness and fatigue a blue tinge to the skin or lips ( cyanosis ) tiredness and rapid breathing when a baby is feeding These problems are sometimes noticeable soon after birth, although mild defects may not cause any problems until later in life. Read more about the symptoms of congenital heart disease and diagnosing congenital heart disease . Types of congenital heart disease There are many types of congenital heart disease and they sometimes occur in combination. Some of the more common defects include: septal defects – where there's a hole between 2 of the heart's chambers (commonly referred to as a \"hole in the heart\") coarctation of the aorta – where the main large artery of the body, called the aorta, is narrower than normal pulmonary valve stenosis – where the pulmonary valve, which controls the flow of blood out of the lower right chamber of the heart to the lungs, is narrower than normal transposition of the great arteries – where the pulmonary and aortic valves and the arteries they're connected to have swapped positions underdeveloped heart – where part of the heart doesn’t develop properly making it difficult for it to pump enough blood around the body or lungs Read more about the types of congenital heart disease . Treating congenital heart disease Treatment for congenital heart disease usually depends on the defect you or your child has. Mild defects, such as holes in the heart, often don't need to be treated, as they may improve on their own and may not cause any further problems. Surgery or interventional procedures are usually required if the defect is significant and causing problems. Modern surgical techniques can often restore most or all of the heart's normal function. However, people with congenital heart disease often need treatment throughout their life and therefore require specialist review during childhood and adulthood. This is because people with complex heart problems can develop further problems with their heart rhythm or valves over time. Most surgery and interventional procedures aren't considered to be a cure. The affected person's ability to exercise may be limited and they may need to take extra steps to protect themselves from getting infections. It's important that a person with heart disease and their parents or carers discuss these issues with their specialist medical team. Read more about treating congenital heart disease and the complications of congenital heart disease . National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If your child has congenital heart disease, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat congenital heart disease. You can opt out of the register at any time. The heart The heart is divided into 4 main sections called chambers. These are known as the: left atrium (collects blood returning from the lungs) left ventricle (the main pumping chamber for the body) right atrium (collects blood returning from the body's veins) right ventricle (pumps bloods to the lungs) There are also 4 valves controlling how the blood flows through the heart and around the body. These are known as the: mitral valve (separating the left atrium from the left ventricle) aortic valve (separating the left ventricle from the main artery, the aorta) tricuspid valve (separating the right atrium from the right ventricle) pulmonary valve (separating the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery to the lung) Congenital heart disease can occur if any of these chambers or valves doesn't develop properly while a baby is in the womb.

    "title": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/",
    "text": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a condition where the \"ball and socket\" joint of the hip does not properly form in babies and young children. It's sometimes called congenital dislocation of the hip, or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded, like a ball, and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket. In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). DDH may affect 1 or both hips, but it's more common in the left hip. It's also more common in: girls firstborn children families where there have been childhood hip problems (parents, brothers or sisters) babies born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy Without early treatment, DDH may lead to: problems moving around, for example a limp pain osteoarthritis of the hip and back With early diagnosis and treatment, children are less likely to need surgery, and more likely to develop normally. Diagnosing DDH Your baby's hips will be checked as part of the newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of being born, and again at 6 to 8 weeks of age. The examination involves gently moving your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. It should not cause them any discomfort. If a doctor, midwife or nurse thinks your baby's hip feels unstable, they should have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old. Babies should also have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old if: there have been childhood hip problems in your family your baby was born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy If you have had twins or multiples and 1 of the babies was in the breech position, each baby should have an ultrasound scan of their hips by the time they're 4 to 6 weeks old. Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due, but they should still be checked to make sure. Get help and support from the charity Steps if your baby's been diagnosed with DDH Treating DDH Pavlik harness Babies diagnosed with DDH early in life are usually treated with a fabric splint called a Pavlik harness. This secures both of your baby's hips in a stable position and allows them to develop normally. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/729142/view The harness needs to be worn constantly for 6 to 12 weeks and should not be removed by anyone except a health professional. The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments. Your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you. Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're wearing a Pavlik harness. This will include information on: how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness – nappies can be worn normally cleaning the harness if it's soiled – it still should not be removed, but can be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush positioning your baby while they sleep – they should be placed on their back and not on their side how to avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness – you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed. You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off. Swimming is often recommended. Surgery Surgery may be needed if your baby is diagnosed with DDH after they're 6 months old, or if the Pavlik harness has not helped. The most common surgery is called reduction. This involves placing the femoral head back into the hip socket. Reduction surgery is done under general anaesthetic and may be done as either: closed reduction – the femoral head is placed in the hip socket without making any large cuts open reduction – a cut is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the femoral head into the hip socket Your child may need to wear a cast for at least 12 weeks after the operation. Their hip will be checked under general anaesthetic again after 6 weeks, to make sure it's stable and healing well. After this investigation, your child will probably wear a cast for at least another 6 weeks to allow their hip to fully stabilise. Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date, to correct any bone deformities. Late-stage signs of DDH The newborn physical screening examination, and the infant screening examination at 6 to 8 weeks, aim to diagnose DDH early. But sometimes hip problems can develop or show up after these checks. It's important to contact a GP as soon as possible if you notice your child has developed any of the following symptoms: 1 leg cannot be moved out sideways as far as the other when you change their nappy 1 leg seems to be longer than the other 1 leg drags when they crawl a limp or \"waddling\" walk Your child will be referred to an orthopaedic specialist in hospital for an ultrasound scan if your doctor thinks there's a problem with their hip. Hip-healthy swaddling A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. But if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped (swaddled) with their legs straight and pressed together, there's a risk this may affect their hip development. Using hip-healthy swaddling techniques can reduce this risk. Make sure your baby is able to move their hips and knees freely to kick.

    "text": "Overview - Contact dermatitis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Contact dermatitis is a type of eczema triggered by contact with a particular substance. Eczema is the name for a group of conditions that cause skin to become dry and irritated. Contact dermatitis usually improves or clears up completely if the substance causing the problem is identified and avoided. Treatments are also available to help ease the symptoms. Symptoms of contact dermatitis Contact dermatitis causes the skin to become itchy, blistered, dry and cracked. Lighter skin can become red, and darker skin can become dark brown, purple or grey. This reaction usually occurs within a few hours or days of exposure to an irritant or allergen. Symptoms can affect any part of the body but most commonly the hands and face. Read about symptoms of contact dermatitis Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/506528/view When to see a pharmacist Speak to a pharmacist if your contact dermatitis is troubling you. They can recommend treatments such as emollients (moisturisers) , which you rub on your skin to stop it becoming dry. Find a pharmacy When to see a GP See a GP if you have persistent, recurrent or severe symptoms of contact dermatitis. They can try to identify the cause and suggest appropriate treatments. A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) for further tests if: the substance causing your contact dermatitis cannot be identified your symptoms are not responding to treatment Read about diagnosing contact dermatitis Causes of contact dermatitis Contact dermatitis can be caused by: an irritant – a substance that directly damages the outer layer of skin an allergen – a substance that causes the immune system to respond in a way that affects the skin Contact dermatitis is most commonly caused by irritants such as soaps and detergents, solvents or regular contact with water. Allergic contact dermatitis is less common and can be triggered by an allergic reaction to substances found in certain products, such as cosmetics, or some metals, including nickel. Handling raw, uncooked fruit and vegetables may also trigger allergic contact dermatitis in some people. Read about causes of contact dermatitis Treating contact dermatitis If you can successfully avoid the irritants or allergens that trigger your symptoms, your skin will eventually clear up. However, as this is not always possible, you may also be advised to use: emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry topical corticosteroids – steroid ointments and creams applied to the skin to relieve severe symptoms If you have a severe episode of contact dermatitis and it covers a large area of your skin, a doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids, but this is rare. Read about treating contact dermatitis Preventing contact dermatitis The best way to prevent contact dermatitis is to avoid contact with the allergens or irritants that cause your symptoms. If you cannot avoid contact, you can take steps to reduce the risk of the allergens or irritants causing symptoms, including: cleaning your skin – if you come into contact with an allergen or irritant, rinse the affected skin with warm water and an emollient as soon as possible using gloves to protect your hands – but take them off every now and again, as sweating can make any symptoms worse; you may find it useful to wear cotton gloves underneath rubber gloves if the rubber also irritates you changing products that irritate your skin – check the ingredients on make-up or soap to make sure it does not contain any irritants or allergens; in some cases, you may need to contact the manufacturer or check online to get this information applying emollients frequently and in large amounts – these keep your skin hydrated and help protect it from allergens and irritants; you could also use emollient soap substitutes rather than regular bar or liquid soaps, which can dry out your skin Other types of eczema Other types of eczema include: atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of eczema; it often runs in families and is linked to other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever discoid eczema – circular or oval patches of eczema on the skin varicose eczema – this most often affects the lower legs; it's caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins Page last reviewed: 03 May 2023 Next review due: 03 May 2026 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Overview - Coronary heart disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Recovery Prevention Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death in the UK and worldwide. CHD is sometimes called ischaemic heart disease or coronary artery disease. Symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD) The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are: chest pain (angina) shortness of breath pain in your neck, shoulders, jaw or arms feeling faint feeling sick (nausea) But not everyone has the same symptoms and some people may not have any before coronary heart disease is diagnosed. Causes of coronary heart disease (CHD) Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. Over time, the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma. Atherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors, such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. You're also more at risk of getting atherosclerosis if you have conditions like high cholesterol , high blood pressure (hypertension) or diabetes . Diagnosing coronary heart disease (CHD) If a doctor feels you're at risk of coronary heart disease, they may carry out a risk assessment. They'll ask you about your medical and family history and your lifestyle, and they'll take a blood test . Further tests may be needed to confirm coronary heart disease, including: electrocardiogram (ECG) echocardiogram chest x-ray coronary angiogram Read more about how coronary heart disease is diagnosed . Treating coronary heart disease (CHD) Coronary heart disease cannot be cured but treatment can help manage the symptoms and reduce the chances of problems such as heart attacks. Treatment can include: lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and stopping smoking medicines angioplasty – where balloons and stents are used to treat narrow heart arteries surgery Recovering from the effects of coronary heart disease (CHD) If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty, or heart surgery, you’ll want to get back to as full a life as possible. Advice and support is available to help you deal with aspects of your life that may have been affected by coronary heart disease. Read more about recovering from the effects of coronary heart disease . Preventing coronary heart disease (CHD) You can reduce your risk of getting coronary heart disease by making some simple lifestyle changes. These include: eating a healthy, balanced diet being physically active giving up smoking controlling blood cholesterol and sugar levels Keeping your heart healthy will also have other health benefits, such as helping reduce your risk of stroke and dementia . The heart The heart is a muscle about the size of your fist. It pumps blood around your body and beats approximately 70 times a minute. After the blood leaves the right side of the heart, it goes to your lungs where it picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood returns to your heart and is then pumped to the body's organs through a network of arteries. The blood returns to your heart through veins before being pumped back to your lungs again. This process is called circulation. The heart gets its own supply of blood from a network of blood vessels on the heart's surface called coronary arteries. Video: coronary arteries and heart disease This video shows how your heart works and what happens when your coronary arteries stop functioning properly.

    "text": "Overview - Corticobasal degeneration Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a rare condition that can cause gradually worsening problems with movement, speech, memory and swallowing. It's often also called corticobasal syndrome (CBS). CBD is caused by increasing numbers of brain cells becoming damaged or dying over time. Most cases of CBD develop in adults aged between 50 and 70. CBD symptoms The symptoms of CBD get gradually worse over time. They are very variable and many people only have a few of them. Symptoms can include: difficulty controlling your limb on one side of the body (a \"useless\" hand) muscle stiffness shaking ( tremors ), jerky movements and spasms ( dystonia ) problems with balance and co-ordination slow and slurred speech symptoms of dementia , such as memory and visual problems slow, effortful speech difficulty swallowing One limb is usually affected at first, before spreading to the rest of the body. The rate at which the symptoms progress varies widely from person to person. Read more about the symptoms of CBD . What causes CBD? CBD occurs when brain cells in certain parts of the brain are damaged as a result of a build-up of a protein called tau. The surface of the brain (cortex) is affected, as well as a deep part of the brain called the basal ganglia. Tau occurs naturally in the brain and is usually broken down before it reaches high levels. In people with CBD, it isn't broken down properly and forms harmful clumps in brain cells. CBD has been linked to changes in certain genes, but these genetic links are weak and the risk to other family members is very low. Diagnosing CBD There's no single test for CBD. Instead, the diagnosis is based on the pattern of your symptoms. Your doctor will try to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as Parkinson's disease or a stroke . You may need to have a brain scan to look for other possible causes of your symptoms, as well as tests of your memory, concentration and ability to understand language. You will usually see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves). Read more about how CBD is diagnosed . Treatments for CBD As someone with CBD can be affected in many different ways, treatment and care is best provided by a team of health and social care professionals working together. Treatments may include: medication – to improve stiffness and muscle spasms, sleep and mood, pain or memory physiotherapy – to help with movement and balance difficulties speech and language therapy – to help with communication and swallowing problems occupational therapy – to improve the skills and abilities needed for daily activities at home palliative care and advanced care planning Read more about treatment for CBD . Outlook There is currently no treatment that has been shown to stop CBD getting gradually worse, although treatments can reduce many of the symptoms. Good care and assistance can help someone with CBD be more independent and enjoy a better quality of life, but the condition will eventually put them at risk of serious complications. CBD usually changes very slowly. Many people find it helpful to plan ahead with their doctors (GP and specialist) to make decisions about what to do in later stages of the illness. Difficulty swallowing can cause choking, or inhaling food or liquid into the airways. This can lead to pneumonia , which can be life-threatening. As a result of these complications, the average life expectancy for someone with CBD is around 6 to 8 years from when their symptoms start. However, this is only an average and CBD is very variable. Information about you If you have CBD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register on the National Disease Registration Service website . Page last reviewed: 27 September 2022 Next review due: 27 September 2025 Next : Symptoms"

Symptoms of cradle cap The main symptom of cradle cap is patches of greasy, scaly skin. It's usually found on the scalp and face, but sometimes affects the nappy area. It can look like: patches of white or yellow greasy scales on the scalp and face that form a crust which might flake off small, dry flakes of skin on the nappy area The scales look similar on all skin tones. But the skin under the scales may look pink or red if your baby has white skin, or lighter or darker than the surrounding skin if your baby has brown or black skin. It is not itchy or painful and does not bother your baby. The cause of cradle cap is not clear, but it cannot be caught from other babies.

Symptoms of craniosynostosis Babies' heads come in all shapes and sizes. It's normal for their head to be a slightly unusual shape. It will often get better as they grow. But your baby may have a problem like craniosynostosis if: their head is long and narrow, like a rugby ball their forehead is pointy or triangular one side of their head is flattened or bulging out the soft spot on the top of their head (fontanelle) disappears before they're 1 year old If the problem is mild, it may not be noticeable until your child is older. Rarely, your child may have symptoms such as: learning difficulties sight or hearing loss breathing problems, like not being able to breathe through their mouth dental problems, such as missing or crowded teeth Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: Your baby or child has symptoms of craniosynostosis and: they seem to have problems with their vision or hearing they have speech problems or they're slow to start talking they have difficulty breathing normally through their mouth, which can lead to snoring and sleep problems at night You should also see a GP if you're concerned about the development of your child’s head in terms of its shape and size. What happens at your GP appointment The GP will examine your child's head. They may also take some measurements to see if it's an unusual size for your child's age. If they think your child could have craniosynostosis, they may refer them to a specialist centre for more tests, like X-rays or scans. These tests should help determine what type of craniosynostosis your child has, and what type of treatment they'll need as they grow older. Types of craniosynostosis Types of craniosynostosis and their effects Type What it means Sagittal craniosynostosis Affects the top of the head, making it long and narrow, and can also cause a delay in speech. Coronal craniosynostosis Affects the side of the head, making the forehead look flattened on one side (unicoronal) or both sides (bicoronal). Metopic craniosynostosis Affects the forehead, making it look pointy or triangular. Lambdoid craniosynostosis Affects the back of the head, making it flattened on 1 side. Syndromic synostosis (complex) craniosynostosis Affects more than 1 part of the head and can also affect other parts of the body. It's caused by an underlying genetic condition. There are different types which can also cause problems with hearing, sight, breathing and learning. Information: NHS centres for craniosynostosis There are 4 specialist NHS centres for craniosynostosis: Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool Birmingham Children's Hospital Great Ormond Street Hospital in London John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford Treatment for craniosynostosis If your baby has craniosynostosis they will have regular check-ups to monitor it. Treatment usually involves surgery. The type of treatment will depend on: the type of craniosynostosis your baby has their symptoms their age Some cases of craniosynostosis may just be monitored and not need treatment. Surgery usually involves making a cut across the top of your child’s head, removing and reshaping the affected parts of their skull, and then fixing them back in place. It's done under general anaesthetic (they will be asleep). Your child may need to stay in hospital for up to a week afterwards. In some cases it may be possible to treat craniosynostosis with a less invasive procedure called an endoscopy (where a thin, flexible tube is passed through a small incision in the skull), followed by wearing a specially designed helmet. The care team looking after your baby will talk to you about the options. Depending on their symptoms, they may also need: regular hearing and eye tests and sometimes glasses speech and language therapy specialist dental treatments psychological counselling further surgery as an older child or teenager Long-lasting effects of craniosynostosis Many children do not have any lasting health problems from craniosynostosis. They may have a scar across the top of their head if they had surgery, but this will be hidden by their hair. Your child will have regular check-ups to see how they're doing. These may be every few weeks at first but will become less frequent as they get older. If your child has certain types of craniosynostosis, surgery cannot always fully correct the shape of their head and they may need ongoing care. Certain types of craniosynostosis can lead to long-term conditions like learning difficulties, hearing loss and problems with sight, such as having a lazy eye.

    "text": "Overview - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time. Symptoms of CJD Symptoms of CJD include: loss of intellect and memory changes in personality loss of balance and co-ordination slurred speech vision problems and blindness abnormal jerking movements progressive loss of brain function and mobility Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection. This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection. Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . What causes CJD? CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria. For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them. Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Types of CJD There are 4 main types of CJD. Sporadic CJD Sporadic CJD is the most common type. The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (\"misfolds\") and turns into a prion. Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65. Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK. In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK. Variant CJD Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD. Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain. See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information. But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear. The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD. The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion , although this has only happened 5 times in the UK. In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK. Familial or inherited CJD Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD. It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK. The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s. In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK. Iatrogenic CJD Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment. For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD. Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk. Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person. But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare. In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985. How CJD is treated There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible. This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression , and painkillers to relieve pain. Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding. Read more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Variant CJD compensation scheme In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD. The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families. Page last reviewed: 07 September 2021 Next review due: 07 September 2024 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Crohn's disease Crohn's disease is a long-term condition where part of your gut becomes inflamed. It cannot currently be cured, but there are treatments that can help prevent or manage the symptoms. Symptoms of Crohn's disease Crohn's disease symptoms vary, depending on which part of your gut is affected, such as your mouth, stomach, bowel or bottom (anus). Common symptoms include: diarrhoea blood or mucus in your poo stomach pain pain in your bottom (anus) feeling very tired or generally unwell loss of appetite and losing weight in children, not growing as expected, or delayed puberty The symptoms can be mild or severe. They usually come and go over time, called flare-ups and remissions. A flare-up can last from a few days to several months. You may also have symptoms affecting other parts of your body, such as joint pain, sore eyes and skin rashes. Symptoms most commonly start in teenagers and younger adults, but it can happen at any age. Information: If you're not sure it's Crohn's disease Symptoms of Crohn's disease can be similar to other conditions that affect your gut, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , ulcerative colitis , diverticular disease and coeliac disease . But do not try to diagnose the problem yourself. Get medical help if you're worried. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you could have Crohn's disease you have Crohn's disease and your symptoms get worse or treatments are not helping Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your poo is black or dark red you have bloody diarrhoea You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . How Crohn's disease is diagnosed If a GP thinks you could have Crohn's disease, they may arrange blood tests and tests on a sample of your poo. You'll need to be referred to a specialist in hospital for more tests to confirm the diagnosis and to start treatment. Hospital tests you may have include: tests where a thin tube with a small camera inside is passed through your throat or bottom to check inside your gut, such as a colonoscopy , endoscopy or gastroscopy taking a small sample of tissue from your gut ( biopsy ) scans such as an MRI scan , CT scan or ultrasound scan There's no single test to diagnose Crohn's disease. It often takes time to get a diagnosis, as the symptoms vary and can be similar to other conditions. Information: Find out more Crohn's and Colitis UK: tests and investigations Treatment for Crohn's disease There's currently no cure for Crohn's disease. But there are treatments that can help you stay without symptoms for long periods (in remission). The type of treatment you have will depend on your symptoms. You'll probably need different treatments over time. You'll be supported by a team of healthcare professionals including a specialist doctor (gastroenterologist). You'll have regular check-ups and tests. Medicines for Crohn's disease Treatments to prevent or treat flare-ups include: medicines to reduce inflammation in your gut, such as steroids , mesalazine or sulfasalazine medicines to reduce the activity of your immune system (immunosuppressants), such as azathioprine or mercaptopurine medicines that target your immune system (biological therapy), such as adalimumab or infliximab medicines to help with symptoms, such as painkillers, laxatives or medicines to stop diarrhoea Some people may be offered a special liquid diet (enteral nutrition) instead of medicines. This may be recommended for children or people who cannot take steroids. Surgery for Crohn's disease You might be offered surgery to treat Crohn's disease if your symptoms only affect certain parts of your gut, or if you have severe symptoms and medicines are not working. Surgery may involve: removing the damaged part of your gut and joining healthy sections together, called a bowel resection removing part of your gut and bringing the end of your bowel through an opening made in your tummy (stoma), called an ileostomy or colostomy You may also need surgery to treat any complications affecting your gut. Surgery can work well to reduce symptoms. But there's a chance that symptoms will come back in another part of your gut after surgery. The surgeon will explain the risks and benefits of the operation, and what will happen.

Crohn's disease can make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients from your food, so it's important to have a healthy diet. But there's no clear evidence that a special diet or particular foods help with Crohn's disease. Some people find that certain foods affect symptoms such as diarrhoea, bloating or constipation, but this is different for everyone. Do eat a healthy, balanced diet – your healthcare team can give you dietary advice to make sure you get all the nutrients you need try keeping a diary of your symptoms and things like what you eat, any changes in your medicines, or stress, to see if certain things seem to affect your symptoms have vaccinations such as the flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine if you take medicines that affect your immune system – but check that the vaccine is suitable for you, as some types (live vaccines) may not be recommended get a RADAR key if you need one, to unlock accessible public toilets – you can usually get one from a charity Don’t do not smoke , as it can increase the risk of flare-ups do not make big changes to your diet without getting advice from your healthcare team do not take medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, unless they're recommended by a doctor Information: Find out more Crohn's and Colitis UK: food Crohn's and Colitis UK: RADAR key Complications of Crohn's disease It's common for Crohn's disease to cause complications. These can be serious, but getting the right treatment for your Crohn's disease symptoms will reduce the risk. Over time, inflammation and damage to your gut can lead to: a fistula , where a tunnel develops that connects your bowel to another part of your body, such as your bladder, skin or vagina a tear or sore near your anus ( anal fissure ) part of your gut becoming narrower (called a stricture), which can cause a blockage or make it more difficult for food to pass through a hole in the wall of your bowel (perforated bowel) bowel cancer – if you're at high risk you may be offered regular tests (colonoscopies) to check for this Crohn's disease can also cause other complications, including vitamin deficiencies and problems with your joints, bones, skin, eyes, kidneys and liver. How Crohn's disease affects your life Crohn's disease is a lifelong condition. It affects everyone differently. How it affects you depends on your symptoms, how well your treatment works, and whether you get any complications. Some people have mild symptoms, meaning they need to poo more often and may have symptoms such as stomach pain. Others have more severe symptoms that affect their general health, or have serious complications. Symptoms usually come and go, so you may have times when you feel well and times when your symptoms have a big impact on your daily life. Crohn's disease and pregnancy It's important to speak to a specialist if you want to try for a baby or find out you're pregnant. You can usually have a healthy pregnancy if you have Crohn's disease. But if your symptoms are not well controlled, this can make it more difficult to get pregnant or cause problems in pregnancy. You might need to change your treatment, as some medicines used for Crohn's disease are not suitable if you're pregnant. Some medicines can also affect male fertility. Information: Find out more Crohn's and Colitis UK: living with Crohn's or colitis Causes of Crohn's disease Symptoms of Crohn's disease are caused by a problem with your immune system, which causes it to attack part of your gut. It's not fully understood why this happens. It's thought to be partly caused by the genes you inherit from your parents. You may be more likely to get Crohn's disease if: other people in your family have it you smoke you've recently had a stomach bug you've had your appendix removed in the last few years Help and support for Crohn's disease Crohn's disease can be a difficult condition to live with, both physically and emotionally. If you or someone in your family needs help with daily living because of illness or disability, you may be able to get social care and support . As well as support from your healthcare team, you may find it helpful to talk to other people with Crohn's disease, either at a local support group or online.

    "text": "Cushing's syndrome Cushing's syndrome is a rare condition caused by having too much of a hormone called cortisol in your body. You're more likely to get it if you take high doses of steroid medicines for a long time. Causes of Cushing’s syndrome The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is taking high doses of steroid medicine, such as hydrocortisone or prednisolone for a long time. Sometimes, a small, non-cancerous growth in the pituitary gland (near the brain) or adrenal glands (near the kidneys) can also cause too much cortisol to be released. These glands help control the amount of certain hormones in your body, including cortisol. If the problem is caused by the pituitary gland it’s called Cushing’s disease. If it's caused elsewhere in the body, it’s called Cushing's syndrome. Symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome Anyone can get Cushing’s syndrome, but it’s much more common in women than in men. The symptoms often come on gradually and include: having more body fat on your neck, upper back, chest and tummy – your arms and legs may look thin compared to the rest of your body a red, round face – the redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin skin that bruises easily and stretch marks on your tummy, hips, breasts and under your arms muscle weakness, particularly at the top of your arms and legs low sex drive (loss of libido) changes in mood, such as feeling irritable, anxious or depressed irregular periods or periods stopping completely excessive hair growth (hirsutism) Cushing's syndrome is rare in children. If a child does get it, the main symptoms are obesity and being short for their age. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, particularly if you're taking steroid medicine What happens at your GP appointment If a GP thinks you might have Cushing’s syndrome, they can arrange for the amount of cortisol in a sample of your blood, pee or spit (saliva) to be checked. If you have high cortisol, you may be referred to a hormone specialist (an endocrinologist) for further tests to check for problems with your pituitary or adrenal glands. These may include blood tests and scans of your brain and kidneys. Treatments for Cushing's syndrome Treatment for Cushing’s syndrome depends on what’s causing it and how severe your symptoms are. Treatments can include: gradually reducing how much steroid medicine you take (if steroid medicine is causing Cushing’s syndrome) medicine to control the amount of cortisol your adrenal glands produce radiotherapy to get rid of a non-cancerous growth in the pituitary gland surgery to remove a growth in the pituitary gland or adrenal glands surgery to remove your adrenal glands – after surgery you’ll need to take medicines to replace hormones made by your adrenal glands for the rest of your life After having treatment for Cushing’s syndrome, the amount of cortisol in your body will be checked. If it’s still high, you may need further treatment.

    "text": "Cuts and grazes Most cuts and grazes can be treated at home and will start to heal in a few days. But some wounds may need to be treated by a medical professional if there's a risk of infection or the cut is serious. How to treat a cut or graze yourself You can treat a cut or graze yourself by stopping any bleeding, cleaning the wound, and covering it with a plaster or dressing. This will help stop it getting infected. If it's painful, you can take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (but do not give aspirin to children under 16). What to do if the wound is bleeding a lot Check the wound and make sure there's nothing stuck in it. If there's nothing in the wound, put pressure on it using a bandage or a clean, folded cloth (such as a tea towel) for 10 minutes. If there's something stuck in the wound, do not try to take it out. Make sure not to press down on the object. Press firmly either side of it to push the edges of the wound together. If the wound is on your hand or arm, raise it above your head. If the wound is on your lower limb, lie down and raise it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce the blood flow. When the bleeding has stopped, firmly wrap a new bandage over the first cloth or bandage. If the wound keeps bleeding, leave the first bandage in place and add another one. Keep pressing firmly on the wound for another 10 minutes. How to clean and dress a cut or graze If the bleeding has stopped, you can clean a small wound and then put a plaster or dressing over it. Wash your hands thoroughly and dry them. Put on disposable gloves if you have some. Clean the wound by rinsing it with bottled or tap water, or by using sterile wipes. Clean the skin around the wound using soap and water or antiseptic – but try not to get antiseptic into the wound. Pat the area dry using a gauze swab or a clean tea towel. Put on a sterile dressing or a plaster. Keep the dressing clean by changing it as often as you need. You can take it off after a few days, once the wound has closed. Information: Find out more How to apply plasters and other dressings How to apply a bandage Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: a wound has soil, pus or body fluids in it, or it's still dirty after cleaning it you were bitten by a person or a wild or stray animal a cut is swollen, red and getting more painful or pus is coming out of it a cut is larger than around 5cm (2 inches) you've cut yourself and also feel generally unwell or have a high temperature You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have a cut and cannot stop the bleeding the blood comes out in spurts and is bright red and hard to control you lose feeling near the wound or have trouble moving it you have a bad cut on your face or the palm of your hand the wound is very large or deep there's something stuck in the cut, such as a shard of glass – do not try to take it out yourself Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for cuts and grazes How a cut or graze is treated will depend on how bad it is and if there's a risk of it becoming infected. The cut will be cleaned and closed with either stitches, strips or special glue before a dressing is put over it. But the wound may not be closed straight away if it's infected or there's a risk it may get infected. You may also need to have an injection to prevent tetanus or be given antibiotics if the cut could be infected. Page last reviewed: 06 June 2022 Next review due: 06 June 2025"

    "text": "Cyclical vomiting syndrome Cyclical vomiting syndrome is a rare condition that causes severe episodes of feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting). Avoiding things that trigger it and taking medicines can help manage the symptoms. Symptoms of cyclical vomiting syndrome The main symptoms of cyclical vomiting syndrome are severe episodes of feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting), followed by periods of feeling well. Each episode can last anything from a few hours up to a few days. They begin with sweating, feeling sick and looking paler than usual, followed by retching (trying to be sick) and vomiting. Other symptoms of cyclical vomiting syndrome may include: being very tired (exhaustion) loss of appetite tummy pain diarrhoea dizziness headaches eye pain when looking at bright lights Episodes usually start at the same time of day or night and last for the same length of time. Once these symptoms improve, most people with cyclical vomiting syndrome feel better for a few weeks or months until a new episode begins. Cyclical vomiting syndrome often starts in children around 5 years old and improves as they get older. But it can also affect adults and is often more severe in adults who did not have the condition as a child. Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 now if: you or your child keep being sick and cannot keep fluid down you or your child are peeing less than usual (or your baby has fewer wet nappies) You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Call 111 if you're asking about a child under 5 years old. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if you or your child: vomit blood or have vomit that looks like ground coffee have green vomit (adults) have yellow-green or green vomit (children) have a stiff neck and eye pain when looking at bright lights have a sudden, severe headache have a sudden, severe tummy ache have blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet are having severe difficulty breathing – you're gasping, choking or not able to get words out (babies may make grunting noises or their stomach may suck under their ribcage) are confused or not responding as usual These could be signs of a more serious condition. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. How cyclical vomiting syndrome is diagnosed If you or your child have episodes of severe nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being sick), a doctor will check if your symptoms could be caused by cyclical vomiting syndrome. The doctor may ask you about: how many episodes you've have and how long they last how often you vomit during each episode if you feel well between the episodes and how long you feel well for You may need tests to rule out other conditions. Treatment for cyclical vomiting syndrome Medicines may be able to help with cyclical vomiting syndrome if you have more than 1 episode a month. The medicines you're prescribed will depend on your symptoms and age, but may include: medicines that can be used to treat and prevent migraines anti-sickness medicines painkillers A doctor can also offer support if your child is struggling to cope with the symptoms of cyclical vomiting syndrome. If an episode is very severe, you may need to be treated in hospital with medicine and fluids given directly into a vein (intravenously). This will help to prevent dehydration and treat the symptoms. How to manage the symptoms of cyclical vomiting syndrome There are things you can do to help prevent episodes of cyclical vomiting syndrome, or manage the symptoms. To help prevent episodes: keep a diary to see if certain things trigger your symptoms – for example, some people find certain foods, large meals, stress or lack of sleep can be triggers and it can help to avoid them remember to take any medicine you've been prescribed During an episode: stay in bed and sleep in a dark, quiet room keep taking small sips of fluid, such as water or diluted squash, to prevent dehydration during and after an episode of vomiting – a pharmacist can recommend oral rehydration solutions that you mix with water and drink Causes of cyclical vomiting syndrome The exact cause of cyclical vomiting syndrome is not known, but you're more likely to have it if you or anyone in your family gets migraines. You may find the episodes of vomiting are triggered by something. Common examples include: stress, anxiety or excitement not getting enough sleep or doing too much exercise: colds, allergies and infections certain foods and drinks, such as alcohol, caffeine, cheese or chocolate going without food or fluid for a long time Information: Find out more More information and support for people with cyclical vomiting syndrome is available from: The Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association UK The Migraine Trust Page last reviewed: 31 May 2024 Next review due: 31 May 2027"

    "text": "Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a rare inherited genetic condition that causes breathing and digestive problems. There is currently no cure, but there are medicines and supportive treatments that can help. Symptoms of cystic fibrosis If you have cystic fibrosis, your body makes a thick sticky mucus that can affect your lungs and digestive system. This can cause lots of symptoms and make you more likely to get infections. Symptoms affecting your lungs include: a cough that does not go away and brings up mucus wheezing and shortness of breath frequent sinus infections (sinusitis) and chest infections Symptoms affecting your digestive system include: constipation stomach pain, bloating and swelling large, greasy and sticky poos that are hard to flush away Cystic fibrosis can affect other parts of your body and cause other symptoms, such as: in children, not growing as quickly as expected in adults, losing weight without trying to swollen fingertips and rounder nails very salty sweat, which can leave small crystals on your skin Cystic fibrosis is usually found shortly after birth as part of the NHS newborn screening programme. But if the condition goes undiagnosed, symptoms may only become noticeable when a child is a teenager. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child have symptoms of cystic fibrosis and you've not been diagnosed with it you're worried about your child's growth and development you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy and someone in your or your partner's family has cystic fibrosis Causes of cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an inherited genetic condition. It's caused by an altered gene being passed on to a child by both of their parents. The altered gene causes mucus in the body to become thick and sticky. If the child only gets an altered gene from 1 parent, they will not have symptoms but they could pass the condition on to any children they have, if their partner also has the altered gene. This is called being a carrier. If 2 carriers have a baby, then there is a: 1 in 4 (25%) chance their child will have cystic fibrosis 2 in 4 (50%) chance their child will not get cystic fibrosis but will be a carrier 1 in 4 (25%) chance their child will not get cystic fibrosis or be a carrier Genetic counselling If either you or your partner are carriers or have cystic fibrosis, then you can ask for genetic counselling. This is when you talk to a specialist about having a baby, who can give you more detailed information about your options. Your GP or care team should be able to give you more information about genetic counselling. Information: Find out more Cystic Fibrosis Trust: what are the causes of cystic fibrosis? How cystic fibrosis is diagnosed Cystic fibrosis is one of the conditions that all babies are checked for as part of the newborn blood spot test . Tell the person taking the test if anyone in your family has cystic fibrosis. If the test suggests your baby may have cystic fibrosis, they'll have another test to check the level of salt in their sweat. People with cystic fibrosis usually have high levels of salt in their sweat. Older children and adults who might have cystic fibrosis will have a blood test followed by a sweat test to check for the condition. Carrier testing If a relative has cystic fibrosis or is a known carrier, you can arrange to be tested yourself for the gene. This is known as carrier testing. You can also ask for carrier testing if your partner has cystic fibrosis or is a known carrier. Information: Find out more Cystic Fibrosis Trust: carrier testing Treatments for cystic fibrosis There is currently no cure for cystic fibrosis. But there are treatments that can help ease symptoms. You'll be supported by different healthcare professionals. This may include specialist nurses and doctors, a physiotherapist and a dietitian. Medicines for cystic fibrosis Medicines that may be used to treat cystic fibrosis include: medicines called CFTR modulators that help the lungs work better by reducing the effect the altered cystic fibrosis gene has on cells in the lungs medicines to widen your airways and make breathing easier, or make it easier to cough up mucus antibiotics for infections steroid medicine to reduce inflammation in the airways Treatment and support for symptoms of cystic fibrosis You may also need other treatments to help relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. These include: physiotherapy – a physiotherapist can teach you ways you can improve your breathing and posture to help clear mucus from your lungs medical devices – devices such as inhalers and specially designed masks can help with breathing and mucus clearance dietary and nutritional support – a dietitian can provide advice on a high-energy diet that is easy to digest and you may be given supplements to help your digestion Some people may eventually need a lung transplant if other treatments are not controlling their symptoms, although this is not suitable for everyone. Information: Find out more Cystic Fibrosis Trust: treatments and medications Cystic Fibrosis Trust: lung transplant FAQs How cystic fibrosis affects your life Cystic fibrosis currently has no cure and can shorten your life. However, new treatments mean the symptoms can often be managed and many people diagnosed with the condition today will live well past middle-age. Living with cystic fibrosis can be hard, but having the condition does not always mean you cannot do things like go to school, have a family or get a job. Cystic fibrosis requires life-long care. If you or your child are diagnosed with it, you will usually be referred to your nearest NHS cystic fibrosis care team. These teams are made up of different health professionals, usually based in larger NHS hospitals, who can provide treatment, support and advice on living with cystic fibrosis. Information: Find out more Cystic Fibrosis Trust: life with cystic fibrosis Healthy living with cystic fibrosis There are some things you can do to help lower your risks of complications and stay as healthy as possible if you have cystic fibrosis. Do stay as physically active as possible – this can help with clearing mucus from your body try to have a well balanced diet, with enough calories and nutrients to stay healthy – you can ask to speak to an NHS dietitian for more advice regularly wash your hands with warm water and soap – this can help reduce the chances of picking up some infections consider not meeting other people with cystic fibrosis face-to-face – there's a higher risk of catching serious infections from another person with the condition Don’t do not smoke or vape – this can damage your lungs and make some cystic fibrosis medicines less effective Complications of cystic fibrosis People with cystic fibrosis can sometimes have other problems. Some of these may only develop later on, as a result of the strain that the condition can put on the body. These can include: diabetes liver disease difficulty getting pregnant or infertility weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) damage to the lungs There are treatments that can help manage many of the problems linked to cystic fibrosis . Information: Find out more Cystic Fibrosis Trust: cystic fibrosis complications and symptoms Help and support for cystic fibrosis If you're the parent of a child with cystic fibrosis, or you're living with the condition yourself, you may find it useful to talk to other people with cystic fibrosis. Due to the risk of infection, people with cystic fibrosis should try to avoid close physical contact with each other. But there are charities that can put you in touch with other people with cystic fibrosis.

    "text": "Cystitis Cystitis is a urinary tract infection (UTI) that affects the bladder. It's common, particularly in women. It often gets better by itself, but may sometimes be treated with antibiotics. Some people get cystitis frequently and may need regular or long-term treatment. Symptoms of cystitis Symptoms of cystitis include: pain, burning or stinging when you pee needing to pee more often and urgently than usual pee that's dark, cloudy or strong smelling pain low down in your tummy Symptoms in young children may also include: a high temperature – they feel hotter than usual if you touch their neck, back or tummy wetting themselves reduced appetite and being sick weakness and irritability In older, frail people with cognitive impairment (such as dementia) and people with a urinary catheter , symptoms may also include: changes in behaviour, such as acting confused or agitated (delirium) wetting themselves more than usual shivering or shaking (rigors) Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you have cystitis and your symptoms have not gone away within 3 days your symptoms have not gone away after treatment with antibiotics you have severe cystitis symptoms, such as severe pain in your lower tummy you get cystitis symptoms frequently you have symptoms of cystitis and you're pregnant or you're a man your child has symptoms of cystitis Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You think you or someone else has cystitis and: a high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery a low temperature, or shaking and shivering pain in the lower tummy or in the back, just under the ribs are confused, drowsy or have difficulty speaking are feeling or being sick have not had a pee all day blood in your pee These symptoms could mean you have a kidney infection , which can be serious if it’s not treated as it could cause sepsis . You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment from a GP If you have cystitis, a GP may: offer self-care advice and recommend taking a painkiller do a urine test, although this is not always needed give you a prescription for a 3-day course of antibiotics give you a prescription for antibiotics but suggest you wait for 48 hours before taking them, in case your symptoms go away on their own Treatment for cystitis that keeps coming back If you keep getting cystitis, a GP may prescribe: a single-dose antibiotic to take within 2 hours of having sex, if you've noticed sex triggers cystitis a low-dose antibiotic to take for up to 6 months a vaginal oestrogen cream, if you have gone through the menopause In some women, antibiotics do not work or urine tests do not pick up an infection even though you have cystitis symptoms. This may mean you have a long-term (chronic) bladder infection that is not picked up by current urine tests. Ask the GP for a referral to a specialist for further tests and treatment. Long-term infections are linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer in people aged 60 and over. Things you can try yourself If you have mild symptoms of cystitis, it can help to: take paracetamol up to 4 times a day to reduce pain give children paracetamol – follow the instructions on the bottle drink plenty of water hold a hot water bottle over your lower tummy avoid having sex avoid drinks that may irritate your bladder, like fruit juices, coffee and alcohol pee frequently Some people take cystitis sachets or cranberry drinks and products every day to prevent cystitis from happening, which might help. However, there’s no evidence they help ease symptoms or treat cystitis if the infection has already started. A pharmacist can help with cystitis You can ask a pharmacist about treatments for cystitis. A pharmacist can: offer advice on things that can help you get better suggest the best painkiller to take tell you if you need to see a GP about your symptoms Some pharmacies offer a cystitis management service. They may be able to give antibiotics if they're needed. Find a pharmacy Causes of cystitis Cystitis is usually caused by bacteria from poo getting into the tube that carries urine out of your body (urethra). Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder and cause an infection. Things that increase the chance of bacteria getting into the bladder include: having sex wiping your bottom from back to front after going to the toilet urinary catheters (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine) using spermicide with contraception conditions that block the urinary tract, such as kidney stones being pregnant conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder, such as an enlarged prostate gland in men having been through the menopause having diabetes having a weakened immune system How to prevent cystitis If you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try to help prevent it returning. Do wipe from front to back when you go to the toilet pee as soon as possible after sex drink plenty of fluids, especially water – so that you pee regularly during the day and do not feel thirsty have a shower rather than a bath – this stops exposing your genitals to cleaning products for too long wash the skin outside the vagina (vulva) with water before and after sex change soiled nappies or incontinence pads promptly keep the genital area clean and dry Don’t do not use scented soap, bubble bath or talcum powder do not use spermicide with diaphragm or condoms – try non-spermicidal lube or different type of contraception do not hold your pee in if you feel the urge to go do not rush when going for a pee – try to fully empty your bladder do not drink lots of alcoholic drinks or coffee – they may irritate your bladder do not have lots of sugary foods or drinks – they may encourage bacteria to grow Other ways to prevent cystitis coming back If you keep getting cystitis, there is some evidence you may find it helpful to take: D-mannose – a sugar you can buy as a powder or tablets to take every day cranberry products – available as juice, tablets or capsules to take every day Be aware that D-mannose and cranberry products can contain a lot of sugar.

    "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that's usually harmless. Sometimes it causes problems in babies and people with a weakened immune system. Symptoms of cytomegalovirus (CMV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) does not usually cause any symptoms and most people do not realise they have it. Some people get flu-like symptoms the first time they get CMV, including: a high temperature aching muscles tiredness a skin rash feeling sick a sore throat swollen glands They usually get better without treatment within about 3 weeks. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have symptoms of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and: you're pregnant you have a weakened immune system – for example, because you're having chemotherapy The GP may arrange tests to find out if you've been infected with CMV. Complications of cytomegalovirus (CMV) When a baby is born with a CMV infection, it's known as congenital CMV. Most babies with congenital CMV do not have any symptoms. But congenital CMV can sometimes cause problems, including: a rash yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a low birth weight a smaller head than usual (microcephaly) seizures (fits) hearing problems in 1 or both ears problems with the eyes problems with the liver and spleen Babies born with congenital CMV may have tests to check their kidneys, liver, brain, eyes and hearing, and regular follow-up appointments until they're around 5 years old. Information: Find out more CMV Action How cytomegalovirus (CMV) is spread Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is mainly spread through close contact with someone who already has it. You can pass it on through contact with body fluids, including saliva, blood, breast milk, pee and poo, and through sex. CMV can only be passed on when it's active. The virus is active when: you get CMV for the first time – young children often get CMV for the first time at nursery the virus has reactivated because you have a weakened immune system you've been reinfected with a different type (strain) of CMV Congenital CMV is caused by passing on an active CMV infection to your unborn baby during pregnancy. Treatment for cytomegalovirus (CMV) If cytomegalovirus (CMV) is not causing symptoms, you or your baby may not need any treatment. There's currently no treatment for CMV in pregnancy, but in most cases the virus does not cause any problems. Antiviral medicine may be used to treat: babies diagnosed with congenital CMV after they're born people with a weakened immune system people who have had a stem cell transplant or organ transplant Treatment weakens the virus and lowers the chance of serious problems, but it does not cure the CMV infection. Things you can do to lower the chance of getting cytomegalovirus (CMV) in pregnancy The best way to lower the chance of getting cytomegalovirus (CMV) during pregnancy is to: wash your hands using soap and water – especially after changing nappies, feeding young children or wiping their nose regularly wash toys or other items that may have young children's saliva or pee on them avoid sharing food, cutlery and drinking glasses, or putting a child's dummy in your mouth avoid kissing young children on their mouth There's currently no vaccine for CMV. Important Pregnant women who work closely with children or already have a young family are more at risk of getting CMV. Page last reviewed: 20 July 2023 Next review due: 20 July 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Deafblindness Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Management Deafblindness is a combination of sight and hearing loss that affects a person's ability to communicate, access information and get around. It's also sometimes called \"dual sensory loss\" or \"multi-sensory impairment\". A deafblind person won't usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause significant difficulties in everyday life. These problems can occur even if hearing loss and vision loss are mild, as the senses work together and one would usually help compensate for loss of the other. Signs of deafblindness Deafblindness most commonly affects older adults, although it can affect people of all ages, including babies and young children. In older people, it may develop gradually and the person themselves may not realise their vision and/or hearing is getting worse at first. Signs of a problem can include: needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio difficulty following a conversation not hearing noises such as a knock at the door asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly needing to hold books or newspapers very close, or sitting close to the television difficulty moving around unfamiliar places If someone already has either a hearing or vision problem, it's important to look out for signs that suggest the other sense may be getting worse too. Read more about the symptoms of deafblindness . Seeing your GP Visit your GP if you think your hearing or eyesight may be getting worse. If you're worried about a friend or family member, encourage them to speak to their GP. It's best to seek advice as soon as possible, as treatment for some underlying causes of deafblindness can be more effective if started early. Early diagnosis will also ensure the person is able to access local support services sooner. Read more about diagnosing and assessing deafblindness . What causes deafblindness? There are many potential causes of deafblindness. Some babies are born deafblind, but in many cases the hearing and/or vision loss occurs later in life. Causes of deafblindness include: age-related hearing loss genetic conditions, such as Usher syndrome – read more about Usher syndrome from Sense an infection in a baby in the womb, such as rubella (german measles) cerebral palsy – a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination eye problems associated with increasing age, such as cataracts Read more about the causes of deafblindness . Living with deafblindness A range of care and support services is available to help deafblind people. Each deafblind person will have a different level of hearing and sight loss, which means they'll have their own individual care needs. The general aims of care for a deafblind person are to: preserve and maximise any remaining sight or hearing the person has – this could involve treating underlying conditions like cataracts, wearing glasses or using a hearing aid or implant teach alternative methods of communication – such as hands-on signing or braille help retain or develop as much independence as possible – for example, by training the person to use a long cane, a guide dog or offering a communicator guide Your local authority should arrange an assessment to determine exactly what care and support is needed.

Hearing loss can affect a child's speech development and progress at school. Information: Hearing loss in babies Hearing loss can be harder to spot in babies. There is a checklist for how a baby makes and reacts to sound on GOV.UK that can help you notice the signs. Causes of hearing loss There are lots of possible causes of hearing loss. It may be caused by something treatable or it may be permanent. Your symptoms may give you an idea what could be causing it. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP for advice. Common causes of hearing loss and related symptoms Symptoms Possible cause Gradual hearing loss in both ears Aging or damage from loud noise over many years Difficulty hearing in 1 ear, earache, a high temperature, itching in and around the ear, a feeling of pressure in your ear, discharge coming out of the ear Ear infection Difficulty hearing, usually in 1 ear, itchiness, feeling like your ear is blocked Earwax build-up Sudden hearing loss after an ear infection, a very loud noise or a change in air pressure (for example, from flying) Perforated eardrum Sudden hearing loss along with dizziness, a spinning sensation (vertigo) or ringing in your ears (tinnitus) Labyrinthitis or Ménière’s disease Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think your hearing is getting gradually worse you've had treatment for an ear infection or earwax build-up but your hearing has not come back You can also sometimes get a free hearing test at some pharmacies and opticians.

Important Babies, children and older adults are more at risk of dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include: feeling thirsty dark yellow, strong-smelling pee peeing less often than usual feeling dizzy or lightheaded feeling tired a dry mouth, lips and tongue sunken eyes Signs of dehydration in a baby may include: a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on top of their head sunken eyes few or no tears when they cry not having many wet nappies being drowsy or irritable Causes of dehydration Dehydration can happen more easily if you: have diabetes have been sick or have diarrhoea have been in the sun too long ( heatstroke ) have drunk too much alcohol sweat a lot after exercising have a high temperature take medicines that make you pee more (diuretics) Things you can do to treat dehydration You should drink fluids if you have symptoms of dehydration. If you feel sick or have been sick, you may find it hard to drink, so start with small sips and then gradually drink more. A pharmacist can help with dehydration If you're being sick or have diarrhoea and are losing too much fluid, you need to put back the sugar, salts and minerals your body has lost. A pharmacist can recommend oral rehydration solutions. These are powders that you mix with water and then drink. Ask your pharmacist which rehydration solutions are right for you or your child. Find a pharmacy Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you're feeling unusually tired (or your child seems drowsy) you're confused and disorientated you feel dizzy when you stand up and it does not go away you have dark yellow pee or you're peeing less than normal (or your baby has fewer wet nappies) you or your child are breathing quickly or has a fast heart rate your baby or child has few or no tears when they cry your baby has a soft spot on their head that sinks inwards (sunken fontanelle) These can be signs of serious dehydration that need urgent treatment. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Keeping your child hydrated Once dehydration has been treated, it's important that your child's fluid levels are maintained. Do carry on breastfeeding your baby or using formula – try to give small amounts more often than usual give your baby small sips of extra water if they’re on formula or solid foods give regular small sips of rehydration solution to replace lost fluids – ask your pharmacist to recommend one give small children their usual diet Don’t do not make formula weaker do not give young children fruit juice or fizzy drinks – it can make diarrhoea or vomiting worse How to reduce the risk of dehydration Drinking fluids regularly can reduce the risk of dehydration. Water or diluted squash are good choices. You should drink enough during the day, so your pee is a pale clear colour. Drink more when there's a higher risk of dehydrating. For example, if you're being sick, sweating due to hot weather or exercise, or you have diarrhoea. Children under the age of 5 should get plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Helping someone you care for A person you care for may not have a sense of how much they're drinking. You can help them by: making sure they drink at mealtimes making drinking a social thing, like \"having a cup of tea\" offering them food with a high water content – for example, soup, ice cream, jelly and fruits like melon Video: how to prevent dehydration This video shows you how you can reduce the risk of dehydration.

    "text": "Overview - Frontotemporal dementia Contents Overview Symptoms Treatment Frontotemporal dementia is an uncommon type of dementia that causes problems with behaviour and language. Dementia is the name for problems with mental abilities caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. Frontotemporal dementia affects the front and sides of the brain (the frontal and temporal lobes). Dementia mostly affects people over 65, but frontotemporal dementia tends to start at a younger age. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 45-65, although it can also affect younger or older people. Like other types of dementia, frontotemporal dementia tends to develop slowly and get gradually worse over several years. Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia Signs of frontotemporal dementia can include: personality and behaviour changes – acting inappropriately or impulsively, appearing selfish or unsympathetic, neglecting personal hygiene, overeating, or loss of motivation language problems – speaking slowly, struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word, getting words in the wrong order, or using words incorrectly problems with mental abilities – getting distracted easily, struggling with planning and organisation memory problems – these only tend to occur later on, unlike more common forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease There may also be physical problems, such as slow or stiff movements, loss of bladder or bowel control (usually not until later on), muscle weakness or difficulty swallowing . These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult, and the person may eventually be unable to look after themselves. Read more about the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia . Getting medical advice See a GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with a GP and perhaps suggest you go with them. The GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed. Read more about getting a dementia diagnosis . Tests for frontotemporal dementia There's no single test for frontotemporal dementia. The following may be needed to make a diagnosis: an assessment of symptoms – it's normally helpful to have somebody who knows the person well to give an account of their symptoms, especially as someone with frontotemporal dementia may not be aware of changes in their behaviour an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve a number of tasks and questions blood tests – to rule out conditions with similar symptoms brain scans – such as an MRI scan , a CT scan or a PET scan ; these can detect signs of dementia and help identify which parts of the brain are most affected, or help rule out other problems with the brain lumbar puncture – to test the spinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spine); this may be useful to rule out Alzheimer's disease as the cause of symptoms Read more about the tests used to diagnose dementia . Treatments for frontotemporal dementia There's currently no cure for frontotemporal dementia or any treatment that will slow it down. But there are treatments that can help control some of the symptoms, possibly for several years. Treatments include: medicines – to control some of the behavioural problems therapies – such as physiotherapy , occupational therapy , and speech and language therapy for problems with movement, everyday tasks and communication dementia activities – such as memory cafes, which are drop-in sessions for people with memory problems and their carers to get support and advice support groups – who can offer tips on managing symptoms from dementia experts and people living with frontotemporal dementia, and their families Read more about how frontotemporal dementia is treated . Outlook for frontotemporal dementia How quickly frontotemporal dementia gets worse varies from person to person and is very difficult to predict. People with the condition can become socially isolated as the illness progresses. They may not want to spend time in the company of others, or may behave in rude or insulting ways. Home-based help will usually be needed at some stage, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home. The average survival time after symptoms start is around 8 to 10 years. But this is highly variable and some people live much longer than this. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember you're not alone. The NHS and social services , as well as voluntary organisations and specialist support groups, can provide advice and support for you and your family. Read more about looking after someone with dementia. Causes of frontotemporal dementia Frontotemporal dementia is caused by clumps of abnormal protein forming inside brain cells. These are thought to damage the cells and stop them working properly. The proteins mainly build up in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain at the front and sides. These are important for controlling language, behaviour, and the ability to plan and organise. It's not fully understood why this happens, but there's often a genetic link. People who get frontotemporal dementia may have relatives who were also affected by the condition. If you have a family history of frontotemporal dementia, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about being referred to a geneticist and possibly having a genetic test to see if you're at risk. There's a lot of research being done to try to improve understanding of the causes of frontotemporal dementia so treatments can be discovered. If you're interested in helping with research, you can speak to a doctor or register your interest on the Join Dementia Research website. Other names for frontotemporal dementia Doctors sometimes use different names to describe frontotemporal dementia. These include: FTD Pick's disease frontal dementia frontotemporal lobar degeneration behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia primary progressive aphasia semantic dementia progressive non-fluent aphasia More information Living with dementia Living well with dementia Staying independent with dementia Dementia activities Looking after someone with dementia Dementia and your relationships Communicating with someone with dementia Coping with dementia behaviour changes Care and support Sources of help and support for people with dementia Dementia UK: nurse helpline Dementia and care homes Dementia, social services and the NHS Dementia and managing money Managing legal affairs for someone with dementia Dementia and end of life planning Rare Dementia Support How you can help Dementia Friend: Become a Dementia Friend Dementia UK: Admiral nurse dementia helpline Alzheimer's Society: Dementia talking points forum Page last reviewed: 29 June 2023 Next review due: 29 June 2026 Next : Symptoms"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vascular-dementia/",
    "text": "Overview - Vascular dementia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Vascular dementia is a common type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. It's estimated to affect around 180,000 people in the UK. Dementia is the name for problems with mental abilities caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. It's rare in people under 65. Vascular dementia tends to get worse over time, although it's sometimes possible to slow it down. Symptoms of vascular dementia Vascular dementia can start suddenly or begin slowly over time. Symptoms include: slowness of thought difficulty with planning and understanding problems with concentration changes to your mood, personality or behaviour feeling disoriented and confused difficulty walking and keeping balance symptoms of Alzheimer's disease , such as problems with memory and language (many people with vascular dementia also have Alzheimer's disease) These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult and someone with the condition may eventually be unable to look after themselves. Getting medical advice See a GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia, especially if you're over 65 years of age. If it's found at an early stage, treatment may be able to stop vascular dementia getting worse, or at least slow it down. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with a GP and perhaps suggest that you go with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms. They can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed. Find out more about how to get a dementia diagnosis . Tests for vascular dementia There's no single test for vascular dementia. The tests that are needed to make a diagnosis include: an assessment of symptoms – for example, whether these are typical symptoms of vascular dementia a full medical history, including asking about a history of conditions related to vascular dementia, such as strokes or high blood pressure an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve several tasks and questions a brain scan, such as an MRI scan or CT scan , to look for any changes that have happened in your brain Find out more about the tests used to diagnose dementia . Treatments for vascular dementia There's currently no cure for vascular dementia and there's no way to reverse any loss of brain cells that happened before the condition was diagnosed. But treatment can sometimes help slow down vascular dementia. Treatment aims to tackle the underlying cause, which may reduce the speed at which brain cells are lost. This will often involve: eating a healthy, balanced diet losing weight if you're overweight stopping smoking getting fit cutting down on alcohol taking medicines, such as those used to treat high blood pressure , lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots Other treatments, including physiotherapy , occupational therapy , dementia activities (such as memory cafes) and psychological therapies , can help reduce the impact of any existing problems. Outlook for vascular dementia Vascular dementia will usually get worse over time. This can happen in sudden steps, with periods in between where the symptoms do not change much, but it's difficult to predict when this will happen. Home-based help will usually be needed, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home . Although treatment can help, vascular dementia can significantly shorten life expectancy. But this is highly variable, and many people live for several years with the condition, or die from some other cause. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you're not alone. The NHS and social services , as well as voluntary organisations, can provide advice and support for you and your family. Causes of vascular dementia Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills brain cells. This can happen as a result of: narrowing and blockage of the small blood vessels inside the brain a single stroke , where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off lots of \"mini strokes\" (also called transient ischaemic attacks, or TIAs) that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain In many cases, these problems are linked to underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes , and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and being overweight. Tackling these might reduce your risk of vascular dementia in later life, although it's not yet clear exactly how much your risk of dementia can be reduced.

    "text": "Dengue Dengue, also known as dengue fever, is an infection spread by mosquitoes. It's not usually serious and often gets better on its own. Some people get a more severe type of dengue, but this is rare. Check if you're at risk of dengue You can get dengue if you're bitten by an infected mosquito. The mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus bite during the day. Dengue is very common in certain parts of the world. It's often found in tropical areas including: parts of Africa and Asia Central and South America the Caribbean the Pacific islands some southern areas of North America There's also a risk of getting dengue at certain times of the year (spring to November) in parts of southern Europe. European countries where dengue has been found include: Croatia France Italy Spain Portugal and Madeira Dengue is not found in the UK and you cannot catch it from another person. Information: Check before you travel You can check the risks for a country you're travelling to on the TravelHealthPro website Symptoms of dengue Dengue does not always cause symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they usually start 4 to 10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Some dengue symptoms are similar to flu . They include: a high temperature a severe headache pain behind your eyes muscle and joint pain feeling or being sick swollen glands a blotchy rash made up of flat or slightly raised spots – this can affect large areas of your body Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you feel unwell after travelling to a country where dengue is found Check your symptoms on 111 online or call 111. Tell anyone you speak to about your recent travel. Get medical advice quickly if you have dengue symptoms while you're travelling. Severe dengue Some people get a more severe type of dengue a few days after they first started feeling ill, but this is rare. You may start to feel better with your temperature returning to normal, but about 24 to 48 hours later you may get more serious symptoms. Symptoms of severe dengue include: severe tummy pain repeatedly being sick fast breathing bleeding gums or nose extreme tiredness (fatigue) being unable to relax (restlessness) blood in your vomit or poo Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have travelled to a country where dengue is found and you have symptoms of severe dengue Severe dengue can be very serious if it's not treated quickly in hospital. Go to a hospital as soon as possible if you get severe dengue symptoms while you're travelling. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for dengue Most people with dengue feel better in a few days. There is no treatment for dengue, but you can help ease your symptoms by: resting drinking plenty of fluids taking paracetamol to help bring down your temperature and ease any pain Do not take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen or aspirin. These can cause bleeding problems if you have dengue. If you have severe dengue, you'll need to stay in hospital until you recover. How to prevent dengue If you're at increased risk of getting seriously ill from dengue, you should consider not travelling to countries where the infection is found. At-risk groups include those who: are very young are older are pregnant have a weakened immune system have certain health conditions, including asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or a condition that makes you bleed more easily have had dengue in the past If you're in a country where dengue is found, the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Do wear long-sleeved clothing and trousers to cover your arms and legs, particularly during early morning and early evening use insect repellent on your skin (ideally one that contains the ingredient DEET) close windows and doors whenever possible, or use blinds or screens sleep under a mosquito net treated with insecticide, including during the day Information: Dengue vaccination There is a vaccine that helps protect against dengue. It's recommended for people who have had, or might have had, dengue in the past and are travelling to a part of the world where dengue is common. Get advice from a travel clinic if you're travelling to a part of the world where dengue is common. If you need the vaccine, you'll have to pay for it privately.

    "text": "Detached retina (retinal detachment) A detached retina is when the thin layer at the back of your eye (retina) becomes loose. It needs to be treated quickly to stop it permanently affecting your sight. Symptoms of a detached retina Symptoms of a detached retina include: floaters (dots and lines) or flashes of light in your eye a dark \"curtain\" or shadow in your vision changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if: floaters (dots and lines) suddenly appear in your vision or suddenly increase in number you get flashes of light in your vision you have a dark \"curtain\" or shadow moving across your vision your vision gets suddenly blurred You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment for a detached retina You'll be referred to hospital for surgery if tests show your retina may be detached or has started to come away (retinal tear). Surgery will usually stop your vision getting worse. What happens during surgery for a detached retina or tear Surgery to re-attach the retina or fix a retinal tear may involve: removing and replacing the jelly inside your eye (vitrectomy) attaching a small band around your eye to push the wall of your eye and retina closer together (scleral buckling) injecting a bubble of gas into your eye to push the retina against the back of your eye (pneumatic retinopexy) sealing the tear in your retina with laser or freezing treatment (cryotherapy) It's usually done with local anaesthetic, so you're awake but your eye is numbed. You do not normally need to stay in hospital overnight. You may be asked to lie or sit in a particular position for up to 7 days after the surgery. This is so that your retina is in the correct position to help it heal. Recovering from a detached retina Recovery time after surgery for a detached retina varies. But as a general guide, for 2 to 6 weeks after surgery: your vision may be blurry your eye may be sore and red – take paracetamol if you need to you may need to take time off work you may not be able to drive you may need to avoid flying (if you've had a bubble of gas put into your eye) Most people are eventually able to return to all their normal activities. Important Call the hospital or go to A&E if the pain, redness or blurriness gets worse after surgery. You may need further treatment. Causes of a detached retina A detached retina is usually caused by changes to the jelly inside your eye, which can happen as you get older. This is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). It's not clear exactly why PVD can lead to retinal detachment in some people and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. But it's more likely to happen if you: are short-sighted have had an eye operation (such as cataract surgery) have had an eye injury have a family history of retinal detachment Find out more about posterior vitreous detachment from RNIB Important: If your symptoms come back You can get a detached retina more than once.

    "text": "Overview - Developmental co-ordination disorder (dyspraxia) in children Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, is a condition affecting physical co-ordination. It causes a child to perform less well than expected in daily activities for their age, and appear to move clumsily. This topic is about DCD in children, although the condition often causes continued problems into adulthood. Find out more about DCD in adults . Symptoms of DCD Early developmental milestones of crawling, walking, self-feeding and dressing may be delayed in young children with DCD. Drawing, writing and performance in sports are also usually behind what is expected for their age. Although signs of the condition are present from an early age, children vary widely in their rate of development. This means a definite diagnosis of DCD does not usually happen until a child with the condition is 5 years old or more. Find out more about symptoms of DCD in children . When to seek medical advice If you're concerned about your child's health or development, talk to a GP or health visitor, or speak to a nurse, doctor or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) at your child's school. They may refer your child to an occupational therapist, paediatrician, or another health professional who can assess them and try to identify any developmental problems. Find out more about diagnosing DCD in children . Causes of DCD Doing co-ordinated movements is a complex process that involves many different nerves and parts of the brain. Any problem in this process could potentially lead to difficulties with movement and co-ordination. It's not usually clear why co-ordination doesn't develop as well as other abilities in children with DCD. However, a number of risk factors that can increase a child's likelihood of developing DCD have been identified. These include: being born prematurely, before the 37th week of pregnancy being born with a low birth weight having a family history of DCD, although it is not clear exactly which genes may be involved in the condition the mother drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs while pregnant Treating DCD There's no cure for DCD, but a number of therapies can help children to manage their problems. These include: being taught ways to do activities they find difficult, such as breaking down difficult movements into smaller parts and practicing them regularly adapting tasks to make them easier, such as using special grips on pens and pencils so they are easier to hold Although DCD does not affect how intelligent a child is, it can make it more difficult for them to learn and they may need extra help to keep up at school. Treatment for DCD will be tailored to your child and usually involves a number of different healthcare professionals working together. Although the physical co-ordination of a child with DCD will remain below average, this may be less of a problem as they get older and develop coping strategies. Some children may continue to have problems. However, difficulties in school – particularly producing written work – can become much more prominent and require extra help from parents and teachers. Find out more about treating DCD in children . Dyspraxia or DCD? While many people in the UK use the term dyspraxia to refer to the difficulties with movement and co-ordination that first develop in young children, this term is used less often by healthcare professionals. Instead, most healthcare professionals use the term developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) to describe the condition. This term is generally preferred by healthcare professionals because dyspraxia can have several meanings. For example, dyspraxia can be used to describe movement difficulties that happen later in life because of damage to the brain, such as from a stroke or head injury . Some healthcare professionals may also use the term specific developmental disorder of motor function (SDDMF) to refer to DCD.

    "title": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/",
    "text": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a condition where the \"ball and socket\" joint of the hip does not properly form in babies and young children. It's sometimes called congenital dislocation of the hip, or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded, like a ball, and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket. In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). DDH may affect 1 or both hips, but it's more common in the left hip. It's also more common in: girls firstborn children families where there have been childhood hip problems (parents, brothers or sisters) babies born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy Without early treatment, DDH may lead to: problems moving around, for example a limp pain osteoarthritis of the hip and back With early diagnosis and treatment, children are less likely to need surgery, and more likely to develop normally. Diagnosing DDH Your baby's hips will be checked as part of the newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of being born, and again at 6 to 8 weeks of age. The examination involves gently moving your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. It should not cause them any discomfort. If a doctor, midwife or nurse thinks your baby's hip feels unstable, they should have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old. Babies should also have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old if: there have been childhood hip problems in your family your baby was born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy If you have had twins or multiples and 1 of the babies was in the breech position, each baby should have an ultrasound scan of their hips by the time they're 4 to 6 weeks old. Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due, but they should still be checked to make sure. Get help and support from the charity Steps if your baby's been diagnosed with DDH Treating DDH Pavlik harness Babies diagnosed with DDH early in life are usually treated with a fabric splint called a Pavlik harness. This secures both of your baby's hips in a stable position and allows them to develop normally. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/729142/view The harness needs to be worn constantly for 6 to 12 weeks and should not be removed by anyone except a health professional. The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments. Your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you. Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're wearing a Pavlik harness. This will include information on: how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness – nappies can be worn normally cleaning the harness if it's soiled – it still should not be removed, but can be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush positioning your baby while they sleep – they should be placed on their back and not on their side how to avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness – you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed. You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off. Swimming is often recommended. Surgery Surgery may be needed if your baby is diagnosed with DDH after they're 6 months old, or if the Pavlik harness has not helped. The most common surgery is called reduction. This involves placing the femoral head back into the hip socket. Reduction surgery is done under general anaesthetic and may be done as either: closed reduction – the femoral head is placed in the hip socket without making any large cuts open reduction – a cut is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the femoral head into the hip socket Your child may need to wear a cast for at least 12 weeks after the operation. Their hip will be checked under general anaesthetic again after 6 weeks, to make sure it's stable and healing well. After this investigation, your child will probably wear a cast for at least another 6 weeks to allow their hip to fully stabilise. Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date, to correct any bone deformities. Late-stage signs of DDH The newborn physical screening examination, and the infant screening examination at 6 to 8 weeks, aim to diagnose DDH early. But sometimes hip problems can develop or show up after these checks. It's important to contact a GP as soon as possible if you notice your child has developed any of the following symptoms: 1 leg cannot be moved out sideways as far as the other when you change their nappy 1 leg seems to be longer than the other 1 leg drags when they crawl a limp or \"waddling\" walk Your child will be referred to an orthopaedic specialist in hospital for an ultrasound scan if your doctor thinks there's a problem with their hip. Hip-healthy swaddling A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. But if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped (swaddled) with their legs straight and pressed together, there's a risk this may affect their hip development. Using hip-healthy swaddling techniques can reduce this risk. Make sure your baby is able to move their hips and knees freely to kick.

    "text": "Diabetes Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. There are 2 main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes – a lifelong condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin type 2 diabetes – where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin properly Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, over 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. High blood sugar that develops during pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes . It usually goes away after giving birth. Non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (pre-diabetes) Many people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, or pre-diabetes. People with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the risk can be reduced through lifestyle changes. If you have non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, you may be eligible for the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme . The programme helps people make lasting lifestyle changes and has been shown to help prevent type 2 diabetes. People with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are also recommended to have a blood test every year to monitor their blood sugar levels. It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it's likely to get worse if left untreated and can cause long-term health problems. When to see a GP Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include: feeling very thirsty peeing more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush blurred vision Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days. Weight loss is common in people with type 1 diabetes when it first develops and before it's treated, but it's less common in people with type 2 diabetes. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general, or there are no symptoms at all. Causes of diabetes The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly. There are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes. You can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight. You may be more at risk of type 2 diabetes if you: are living with overweight or obesity do not have a healthy diet have a family history of type 2 diabetes are of Asian, Black African or African Caribbean origin take certain medicines such as steroids for a long time have high blood pressure have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy Living with diabetes If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to eat healthily , take regular exercise and have regular checks including blood tests. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you're a healthy weight. Try to quit smoking if you smoke, and cut down on alcohol . People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life. Type 2 diabetes can get worse over time and people living with type 2 diabetes often need medicine, usually in the form of tablets or injections. However, some people can put their type 2 diabetes into remission by losing weight, where their blood sugar is reduced below the diabetes range. Some people are able to do this through a low-calorie diet, but this is not suitable for everyone, so it's important to get medical advice first. Read about: insulin insulin for type 1 diabetes treatment for type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes remission – information from Diabetes UK treating gestational diabetes Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes aged 12 years old or over should be invited to have their eyes screened regularly. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Screening, which includes a 30-minute check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of diagnosing diabetic retinopathy and detecting the condition early where possible so it can be treated more effectively. In many people, this can stop it affecting their vision or reduce the chance of it getting worse. It's important to see a doctor if you notice any problems with your eyesight. Do not wait for your next screening appointment. Read more about diabetic eye screening . Diabetic foot problems Diabetes can damage the nerves in your feet and cause a loss of feeling. It can also reduce the blood supply to your feet. This means you may not notice if your foot is sore or injured, and foot injuries do not heal as well. This can lead to ulcers and infections, and sometimes amputations can be needed in serious cases. Adults with diabetes should have their feet checked every year by a healthcare professional. It's important to see a healthcare professional as soon as possible if you notice any problems with your feet. You can read more about diabetes and foot problems on the Diabetes UK website .

    "text": "Overview - Gestational diabetes Contents Overview Treatment Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth. It can happen at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second or third trimester. It happens when your body cannot produce enough insulin – a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels – to meet your extra needs in pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby during pregnancy and after birth. But the risks can be reduced if the condition is detected early and well managed. Who's at risk of gestational diabetes Any woman can develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but you're at an increased risk if: you are over 40 your body mass index (BMI) is above 30 – use the BMI healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI you previously had a baby who weighed 4.5kg (10lb) or more at birth you had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy 1 of your parents or siblings has diabetes you are of south Asian, Black, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern origin (even if you were born in the UK) you have had a gastric bypass or other weight-loss surgery If any of these apply to you, you should be offered screening for gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. Symptoms of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes does not usually cause any symptoms. Most cases are only discovered when your blood sugar levels are tested during screening for gestational diabetes. Some women may develop symptoms if their blood sugar levels gets too high (hyperglycaemia) , such as: increased thirst needing to pee more often than usual a dry mouth tiredness blurred eyesight genital itching or thrush But some of these symptoms are common during pregnancy and are not necessarily a sign of gestational diabetes. Speak to your midwife or doctor if you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing. How gestational diabetes can affect your pregnancy Most women with gestational diabetes have otherwise normal pregnancies with healthy babies. However, gestational diabetes can cause problems such as: your baby growing larger than usual – this may lead to difficulties during the delivery and increases the likelihood of needing induced labour or a caesarean section polyhydramnios – too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) in the womb, which can cause premature labour or problems at delivery premature birth – giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy pre-eclampsia – a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy complications if not treated your baby developing low blood sugar or yellowing of the skin and eyes ( jaundice ) after he or she is born, which may require treatment in hospital the loss of your baby ( stillbirth ) – though this is rare Having gestational diabetes also means you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. Screening for gestational diabetes During your first antenatal appointment (also called a booking appointment) at around week 8 to 12 of your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will ask you some questions to determine whether you're at an increased risk of gestational diabetes. If you have 1 or more risk factors for gestational diabetes you should be offered a screening test. The screening test is called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which takes about 2 hours. It involves having a blood test in the morning, when you have not had any food or drink for 8 to 10 hours (though you can usually drink water, but check with the hospital if you're unsure). You're then given a glucose drink. After resting for 2 hours, another blood sample is taken to see how your body is dealing with the glucose. The OGTT is done when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. If you've had gestational diabetes before, you'll be offered an OGTT earlier in your pregnancy, soon after your booking appointment, then another OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Find out more at Lab Tests Online: Glucose Tests. Treatments for gestational diabetes If you have gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with your pregnancy can be reduced by controlling your blood sugar levels. You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment. Blood sugar levels may be reduced by changing your diet and being more active if you can. Gentle activities such as walking, swimming and prenatal yoga can help reduce blood sugar. But tell your midwife or doctor before starting an activity you haven’t done before. However, if these changes don't lower your blood sugar levels enough, you will need to take medicine as well. This may be tablets or insulin injections. You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems. If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour does not start naturally by this time. Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled. Find out more about how gestational diabetes is treated . Long-term effects of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes normally goes away after birth. But women who've had it are more likely to develop: gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies type 2 diabetes – a lifelong type of diabetes You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and once every year after that if the result is normal. See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth – do not wait until your next test. You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes do not have any symptoms. You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly. Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life. Information: If you have a history of gestational diabetes, or currently have it, the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme can support you. If you self-refer to the programme, you can get help with diet, exercise and maintaining your weight. Planning future pregnancies If you've had gestational diabetes before and you're planning to get pregnant, make sure you get checked for diabetes. Your GP can arrange this. If you do have diabetes, you should be referred to a diabetes pre-conception clinic for support to ensure your condition is well controlled before you get pregnant. Read more about diabetes in pregnancy . If you have an unplanned pregnancy, talk to your GP and tell them you had gestational diabetes in your previous pregnancy. If tests show you do not have diabetes, you'll be offered screening earlier in pregnancy (soon after your first midwife appointment) and another test at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Alternatively, your midwife or doctor may suggest you test your blood sugar levels yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous gestational diabetes.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes-insipidus/",
    "text": "Overview - Diabetes insipidus Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition where you pee a lot and often feel thirsty. Diabetes insipidus is not related to type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes (also known as diabetes mellitus), but it does share some of the same signs and symptoms. The 2 main symptoms of diabetes insipidus are: extreme thirst (polydipsia) peeing a lot, even at night (polyuria) In very severe cases of diabetes insipidus, a person can pee up to 20 litres of urine in a day. Find out more about the symptoms of diabetes insipidus When to seek medical advice You should always see your GP if you're feeling thirsty all the time. Although it may not be diabetes insipidus, it should be investigated. Also see your GP if you're: peeing more than normal – most healthy adults pass urine 4 to 7 times in a 24-hour period needing to pee small amounts at frequent intervals – sometimes this can occur along with the feeling that you need to pee immediately Children tend to pee more frequently because they have smaller bladders. But seek medical advice if your child pees more than 10 times a day. Your GP will be able to carry out a number of tests to help determine what's causing the problem. Find out more about diagnosing diabetes insipidus What causes diabetes insipidus Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems with a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). AVP plays a key role in regulating the amount of fluid in the body. It's produced by specialist nerve cells in a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. AVP passes from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland, where it's stored until needed. The pituitary gland releases AVP when the amount of water in the body becomes too low. It helps retain water in the body by reducing the amount of water lost through the kidneys, making the kidneys produce more concentrated urine. In most cases of diabetes insipidus, the lack of production of AVP means the kidneys cannot make enough concentrated urine and too much water is passed from the body. This is called AVP deficiency (previously called cranial diabetes insipidus). In rare cases, the kidneys do not respond to AVP. This causes a specific form of diabetes insipidus called AVP resistance (formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). People feel thirsty as the body tries to compensate for the increased loss of water by increasing the amount of water taken in. Find out more about the causes of diabetes insipidus Who's affected by diabetes insipidus Diabetes insipidus affects about 1 in 25,000 people in the general population. Adults are more likely to develop the condition, but it can occur at any age. In rarer cases, diabetes insipidus can develop during pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes insipidus. Types of diabetes insipidus There are 2 main types of diabetes insipidus: AVP deficiency (formerly cranial diabetes insipidus) AVP resistance (formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) Arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) Arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) occurs when there's not enough AVP in the body to regulate urine production. AVP-D is the most common type of diabetes insipidus. It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland – for example, after an infection, operation, brain tumour or head injury. In about 1 in 3 cases of AVP-D there's no obvious reason why the hypothalamus stops making enough AVP. Arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R) Arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R) occurs when there's enough AVP in the body but the kidneys fail to respond to it. It can be caused by kidney damage or, in some cases, inherited as a problem on its own. Some medications, particularly lithium (used to help stabilise mood in some people with specific mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder), can cause AVP-R. Treating diabetes insipidus Treatment is not always needed for mild cases of AVP-D. You just need to increase the amount of water you drink to compensate for the fluid lost through urination. If necessary, a medication called desmopressin can be used to replicate the functions of AVP. AVP-R is often treated with medications called thiazide diuretics, which reduce the amount of urine the kidneys produce. Find out more about treating diabetes insipidus Complications As diabetes insipidus increases water loss in the urine, the amount of water in the body can become low. This is known as dehydration . Rehydration with water can be used to treat mild dehydration. Severe dehydration will need to be treated in hospital.

    "text": "Diabetic ketoacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious condition that can happen in people with diabetes. It's where a lack of insulin causes harmful substances called ketones to build up in the blood. It can be life threatening and needs urgent treatment in hospital. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) include: feeling thirsty needing to pee more often stomach pain, feeling sick or being sick diarrhoea breathing more deeply than usual breath that smells fruity (like pear drop sweets or nail polish remover) feeling tired, sleepy or confused blurred vision The symptoms usually develop over 24 hours, but it can be faster. DKA usually affects people with type 1 diabetes , but it can also happen in people with type 2 diabetes who need insulin. It can happen when people first develop type 1 diabetes and have not yet been diagnosed, particularly children. Checking your blood glucose and ketones If you have diabetes and have any of the symptoms of DKA, check your blood glucose. If it's high, test for ketones if you can. If you use a meter to test for ketones in your blood: under 0.6mmol/L is normal 0.6 to 1.5mmol/L is slightly high – test again in 2 hours 1.6 to 3mmol/L means you're at risk of DKA and should speak to your diabetes care team for advice over 3mmol/L is high and means you may have DKA and should call 999 or go to A&E If you use strips to test for ketones in your pee, over 2+ is high. This means you may have DKA and should call 999 or go to A&E. Important These ketone levels are a guide. Normal blood ketone levels can be different for different people. Your diabetes care team will advise you on what levels to look for. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have a high level of ketones – over 3mmol/L in your blood, or over 2+ in your pee you do not know your ketone levels but have symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, such as feeling thirsty and needing to pee more often, feeling sleepy or confused, and breath that smells fruity (like pear drop sweets or nail polish remover) you have symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis and have not been diagnosed with diabetes Diabetic ketoacidosis can be life threatening so it's important to get treatment quickly. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Urgent advice: Call your diabetes care team now or get help from NHS 111 if: You have diabetes and: your blood glucose is high and your insulin treatment is not working to reduce it, even if your ketones are normal your ketones are slightly high (0.6 to 1.5mmol/L) and you feel unwell your ketones are 1.6 to 3mmol/L, even if you do not feel unwell You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) If you have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) you'll need to be admitted to hospital for urgent treatment. You'll be given insulin, fluids and nutrients through a drip into your vein. You'll be monitored for complications, as DKA can sometimes affect your brain, heart or lungs. Once your ketones are at a safe level and you can eat and drink normally you'll be able to go home. The doctors will talk to you about what caused DKA and give you advice on how to reduce the risk of it happening again. How to reduce your risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) If you have diabetes, it's important to be aware of the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and how to reduce the risk of getting it. Causes of DKA can include being unwell, having an injury or surgery, having your period, or not taking enough insulin . Testing for ketones will help you know when you need to take action, such as increasing your insulin dose. You can get kit to test for ketones free from the NHS, or buy it from a pharmacy. You can use: a ketone meter to test your blood some types of blood glucose monitor that also test for ketones strips to test your pee Do follow the treatment plan agreed with your diabetes care team, including adjusting your insulin dose when you need to check your blood glucose regularly ask your care team about getting a continuous glucose monitor or flash monitor if you do not already have one test for ketones when your blood glucose is high and when you're ill follow the sick day rules you've been given by your care team when you're ill contact your care team if you're not sure what to do Don’t do not stop taking insulin, even if you're not eating do not skip insulin doses Page last reviewed: 08 June 2023 Next review due: 08 June 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Diabetic retinopathy Contents Overview Stages Treatment Prevention Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes , caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. However, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight. To minimise the risk of this happening, people with diabetes should: ensure they control their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol attend diabetic eye screening appointments – screening is offered to all people with diabetes aged 12 and over to pick up and treat any problems early on How diabetes can affect the eyes The retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain which turns them into the images you see. The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in 3 main stages: background retinopathy – tiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but do not usually affect your vision pre-proliferative retinopathy – more severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eye proliferative retinopathy – scar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina; this can result in some loss of vision However, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and treatment can stop it getting worse. Read about the stages of diabetic retinopathy . Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy? Anyone with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes is potentially at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. You're at a greater risk if you: have had diabetes for a long time have a persistently high blood sugar (blood glucose) level have high blood pressure have high cholesterol are pregnant are of Asian or Afro-Caribbean background By keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, you can reduce your chances of developing diabetic retinopathy . Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy You will not usually notice diabetic retinopathy in the early stages, as it does not tend to have any obvious symptoms until it's more advanced. However, early signs of the condition can be picked up by taking photographs of the eyes during diabetic eye screening . Contact your GP or diabetes care team immediately if you experience: gradually worsening vision sudden vision loss shapes floating in your field of vision (floaters) blurred or patchy vision eye pain or redness difficulty seeing in the dark These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it's important to get them checked out. Do not wait until your next screening appointment. Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years old or over is invited for eye screening. How often you're invited depends on your last 2 screening results. If diabetic retinopathy was not found at your last 2 tests, you'll be invited every 2 years. Screening is offered because: diabetic retinopathy does not tend to cause any symptoms in the early stages the condition can cause permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly screening can detect problems in your eyes before they start to affect your vision if problems are caught early, treatment can help prevent or reduce vision loss The screening test involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs. Depending on your result, you may be advised to attend more regular appointments or discuss treatment options with a specialist. Read more about diabetic eye screening . Reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy You can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, or help prevent it getting worse, by: controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels taking your diabetes medicine as prescribed attending all your screening appointments getting medical advice quickly if you notice any changes to your vision maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking Read more about how to prevent diabetic retinopathy . Treatments for diabetic retinopathy Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk. If the condition has not reached this stage, the above advice on managing your diabetes is recommended. The main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are: laser treatment injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes Read more about the treatment of diabetic retinopathy .

    "text": "Differences in sex development Differences in sex development (DSD) is a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs, including genitals. It means a person's sex development is different to most other people's. Sometimes the term Disorders of Sex Development is used, as is Variations in Sex Characteristics (VSC) or Diverse Sex Development. Some people prefer to use the term intersex. Why does DSD happen? You or your child may have sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) usually associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or usually associated with being male (XY chromosomes), but reproductive organs and genitals that may look different from usual. This happens because of a difference with your genes or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body, or both. It can be inherited, but there is often no clear reason why it happens. The most common times to find out that a person has a DSD are around the time of their birth or when they're a teenager. Types of DSDs There are many different types of DSD. Some examples are: Usual female pattern genes with genitals that look different to girls' genitals Some people have XX (usual female) chromosomes with ovaries and a womb, but their genitals may not look the same as many females. For example, they may have a more developed clitoris and their vagina may be closed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD. The most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A person who has CAH lacks an enzyme (chemical substance) that their body needs to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Without these hormones, their body produces more androgens (sex hormones that are naturally higher in males). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth can cause their genitals to look different, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place. CAH can also cause serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible Find out more: The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children: CAH (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) Living with CAH - what is CAH? Genes usually seen in males with genitals that look the same as most girls' and some internal male structures Some people have XY (male) chromosomes, but their external genitals may develop in the usual way for girls or boys. Sometimes it's difficult at first to know whether their genitals are more similar to girls' or boys'. A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD. Many people with 46,XY DSD are boys born with the opening to pass urine towards the bottom of their penis or below it. For some, the scrotum appears separated into two smaller sacs, one on either side. Doctors call this peno-scrotal hypospadias and boys and men with this DSD can have either fully developed or partially developed testes. There are several causes of 46,XY DSD. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) , where the body \"ignores\" androgens or is insensitive to them. Sometimes a person's body does not respond at all or only partly responds to androgens. Complete insensitivity to androgens makes a person with XY chromosomes female. Partial insensitivity to androgens can mean that some people are male and others are female. Ordinary looking genitals but different sex development Some people have a chromosome pattern other than the usual XY or XX. They may have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY). Their internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through a full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods. Doctors call this sex chromosome DSD. One type is Klinefelter syndrome , which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). This can mean they do not produce the usual level of testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as the testes and body hair. Testosterone is also important for bone strength and fertility in men. Another example of this type of DSD is Turner syndrome , which is where a girl is born with a missing X chromosome. Girls and women with Turner syndrome are often infertile and their height may be shorter than average. Find out more: Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association Turner Syndrome Support Society - What is TS? Female with usual external genitals, but without a womb Some females are born with an underdeveloped womb or without a womb, cervix and upper vagina. The ovaries and external genitalia look the same as most girls and women and they develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older. This is called Rokitansky syndrome. It's also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome). The cause is not clear, but girls and women with Rokitansky syndrome/MRKH have XX chromosomes. Often the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex involving the vagina may also be difficult because the vagina may be shorter than most women's. Not having a womb means that a woman cannot become pregnant, but it's sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another woman's womb (surrogacy). You can find more support and information on Rokitansky syndrome at: DSD Teens – MRKH (a.k.a. Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome) MRKH Connect – What is MRKH Sex characteristics usually seen in males or females Some people with a very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis). Their genitals may appear female or male or could look different from either. Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes. The cause is not usually clear, but some people with the condition have been found to have genetic material that's usually seen on the Y chromosome appearing on their X chromosome. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD. What happens after the birth of a baby Doctors will check a baby for DSD soon after birth because of signs such as undescended testicles or if a baby's genitals look different. Tests may be done to help get a clear diagnosis and find out whether any immediate treatment is needed. Tests may include: a further physical examination of your baby done by a specialist an ultrasound scan to examine their internal organs blood tests to check their genes and hormone levels In England you need to register your baby’s birth within 42 days. This is usually enough time to complete the tests, discuss the results with your child’s care team and identify your baby’s sex. Many forms of DSD do not require any medical care other than understanding the baby's development and knowing what to expect as they grow older. A specialist nurse in your care team can help you learn about DSD and a psychologist will help you address any concerns you have. Find out more about what happens when your baby is born with genitals that look different, in the First Days leaflet. This is on the DSD Families Resources website page . Advice for parents of older children Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child does not go through puberty properly. For example, your child may not start showing the changes linked with puberty, or they may start puberty but not have periods. Speak to a GP if you have any concerns about your child's development at puberty. They can refer your child to a specialist. This will usually be a consultant paediatric endocrinologist, who specialises in hormones, or an adolescent gynaecologist. A team of specialist healthcare professionals will work with you to understand your child's condition and offer you and your child support and advice. A psychologist in the team can talk with you or your child about sexuality, relationships and body image among other subjects. Some people with DSD may need hormone therapy and psychological support. Some may want to think about altering their existing genitals, for example by using vaginal stretch techniques. Some people with DSD consider altering the appearance of their genitals by having surgery. If you think you have a DSD If you think or know you have a DSD, information and support is available. Speak to a GP, as they'll be able to refer you to a team of specialist healthcare professionals. They can answer your questions, help you stay healthy and put you in touch with others with DSD if that's something you're interested in. You can stay with the gender linked to your sex at birth, which is the sex on your birth certificate. But if your legal sex does not represent who you are or how you identify, you may want to discuss your options with your care team. If you have a DSD and want to explore parenthood, you can also discuss this with your specialist care team. Where to get support If you have a DSD or you're the parent of a child with a DSD, you may find it useful to contact a group involving others with the same or similar experiences. These groups can often offer more information and advice about living with a DSD, and may be able to put you in contact with others who've been in a similar situation to you. You are welcome to ask your care team about people with experience of your diagnosis in your local area who are happy to be contacted.

    "title": "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/digeorge-syndrome/",
    "text": "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion) DiGeorge syndrome is a condition present from birth that can cause a range of lifelong problems, including heart defects and learning difficulties. The severity of the condition varies. Some children can be severely ill and very occasionally may die from it, but many others may grow up without realising they have it. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a problem with a person's genes, called 22q11 deletion. It is not usually passed on to a child by their parents, but it is in a few cases. It's often diagnosed soon after birth with a blood test to check for the genetic fault. Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome DiGeorge syndrome can cause a range of problems, but most people will not have all of these. Some of the most common issues are: learning and behaviour problems – including delays in learning to walk or talk, learning disabilities and problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism speech and hearing problems – including temporary hearing loss due to frequent ear infections, being slow to start talking and having a \"nasal-sounding\" voice mouth and feeding problems – including a gap in the top of the mouth or lip (cleft lip or palate) , difficulty feeding and sometimes bringing food back up through the nose heart problems – some children and adults have heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease) hormone problems – underdeveloped parathyroid glands produce too little parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism) , which can lead to problems such as shaking (tremors) and seizures (fits) Other possible problems include: a higher risk of getting infections – such as ear infections , oral thrush and chest infections – because the immune system (the body's natural defence against illness) is weaker than normal bone, muscle and joint problems – including leg pains that keep coming back, an unusually curved spine (scoliosis) and rheumatoid arthritis short stature – children and adults may be shorter than average mental health problems – adults are more likely to have problems such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders Causes of DiGeorge syndrome DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a problem called 22q11 deletion. This is where a small piece of genetic material is missing from a person's DNA. In about 9 in 10 cases (90%), the bit of DNA was missing from the egg or sperm that led to the pregnancy. This can happen by chance when sperm and eggs are made. It is not a result of anything you did before or during the pregnancy. In these cases, there's usually no family history of DiGeorge syndrome and the risk of it happening again to other children is very small. In around 1 in 10 cases (10%), the 22q11 deletion is passed on to a child by a parent who has DiGeorge syndrome, although they may not realise they have it if it's mild. What are the chances of my next child having DiGeorge syndrome? If neither parent has DiGeorge syndrome, the risk of having another child with it is thought to be less than 1 in 100 (1%). If 1 parent has the condition, they have a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of passing it on to their child. This applies to each pregnancy. Speak to a GP if you're planning a pregnancy and you have a family history of DiGeorge syndrome, or you have a child with it. They may refer you for a genetic test and talk about your level of risk and discuss your options. These may include: having a blood test to check if you or your partner carry the genetic problem that causes DiGeorge syndrome having tests during pregnancy ( chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis ) to check if your baby has the genetic problem that causes the condition – although this cannot show how severely your child will be affected pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – a type of IVF where eggs are fertilised in a laboratory and embryos are tested for genetic problems before they're implanted in the womb (this is not always available on the NHS) Treatment and support for DiGeorge syndrome There's currently no cure for DiGeorge syndrome. Children and adults with the condition will be closely monitored to check for problems, and these can be treated as they happen, if needed. For example, someone with DiGeorge syndrome may have: regular hearing tests , blood tests , heart scans and measurements of their height and weight an assessment of their development and learning ability before starting school – if your child has a learning disability, they may need extra support at a mainstream school, or they may benefit from attending a special school (read more about education for children with learning disabilities ) speech therapy to help with speech problems and dietary changes (or sometimes a temporary feeding tube) to help with feeding problems physiotherapy for problems with strength and movement treatment from a podiatrist for foot and leg problems, and devices such as shoe inserts (orthoses) for leg pain surgery for more severe problems – for example, surgery to repair heart defects or an operation to repair a cleft palate You may find it useful to speak to a social worker, psychologist or counsellor, who you can contact directly or through a doctor. Charities such as Max Appeal! may also be a good source of support. Read more advice about caring for a disabled child . Outlook for DiGeorge syndrome Everyone with DiGeorge syndrome is affected differently and it's difficult to predict how severe the condition will be. Most children survive into adulthood. As someone with DiGeorge syndrome gets older, some symptoms, such as heart and speech problems, tend to become less of an issue. However, behavioural, learning, and mental health problems can continue to affect their daily life. Many people with DiGeorge syndrome who reach adulthood will have a relatively normal life span, but ongoing health problems can sometimes mean their life expectancy is a bit lower than usual. It's important to attend regular check-ups so that any problems can be found and treated early. Adults with DiGeorge syndrome are often able to live independently. Information about you or your child If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "title": "Diphtheria",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diphtheria/",
    "text": "Diphtheria Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin. It's rare in the UK, but there's a small risk of catching it if you travel to some parts of the world. Diphtheria can be a serious illness and sometimes fatal, especially in children, if it’s not treated quickly. Vaccination can prevent it. Diphtheria vaccination Diphtheria is rare in the UK because babies and children have been routinely vaccinated against it since the 1940s. When childhood diphtheria vaccinations are given The vaccines are given at: 8, 12 and 16 weeks – 6-in-1 vaccine (3 separate doses) 3 years 4 months – 4-in-1 pre-school booster 14 years – 3-in-1 teenage booster Travel vaccination The best way to avoid diphtheria while travelling is to be fully vaccinated against it. If you're travelling to a part of the world where there may be a risk of diphtheria, you may need a booster vaccination if you were last vaccinated against it more than 10 years ago. Since 2018, the World Health Organization has reported a rise in cases in places including: Indonesia India South America Africa Places that have higher cases of diphtheria often change over time. For up-to-date information about the area you're visiting, check the TravelHealthPro country guides . Information: You may be able to get a combined vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and polio free on the NHS. Ask at a GP surgery. How diphtheria is spread Diphtheria is a highly contagious bacterial infection. It's spread by coughs and sneezes, or through close contact with someone who is infected. You can also get it by sharing items, such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding, with an infected person. Symptoms of diphtheria Symptoms usually start 2 to 5 days after becoming infected. Symptoms of diphtheria include: a thick grey-white coating that may cover the back of your throat, nose and tongue a high temperature (fever) sore throat swollen glands in your neck difficulty breathing and swallowing In countries with poor hygiene, infection of the skin (cutaneous diphtheria) is more common. If it's cutaneous diphtheria, it can cause: pus-filled blisters on your legs, feet and hands large ulcers surrounded by red, sore-looking skin Urgent advice: Get urgent medical help if: you have symptoms of diphtheria and: you're in an area of the world where the infection is widespread you have recently returned from somewhere where the infection is widespread you have been in close contact with someone who has diphtheria Diphtheria needs to be treated quickly in hospital to help prevent serious complications, such as breathing difficulties or heart problems. Treatments for diphtheria The main treatments are: antibiotics to kill the diphtheria bacteria medicines that stop the effects of the harmful substances (toxins) produced by the bacteria thoroughly cleaning any infected wounds if you have diphtheria affecting your skin Treatment usually lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Any skin ulcers usually heal within 2 to 3 months, but may leave a scar. People who have been in close contact with someone who has diphtheria may also need to take antibiotics, or may be given a dose of the diphtheria vaccination.

Without treatment, discoid eczema can last for weeks, months or even years. It may also keep coming back – often in the same area that was affected previously. Symptoms of discoid eczema Discoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema. It can affect any part of the body, although it does not usually affect the face or scalp.

These then quickly join up to form larger patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size. On lighter skin these patches will be pink or red. On darker skin these patches can be a dark brown or they can be paler than the skin around them. Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night. Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for ringworm . You may just have 1 patch of discoid eczema, but most people get several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry. Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include: the patches oozing a lot of fluid a yellow crust developing over the patches the skin around the patches becoming hot, swollen and tender or painful feeling sick feeling hot or shivery feeling unwell When to seek medical advice See a pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema. They can recommend a suitable treatment. You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected. You may need to use an antibiotic cream or, in severe cases, take antibiotics as a tablet or capsule. A GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions. A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist) if they're unsure of the diagnosis or if you need a patch test. Causes of discoid eczema The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may happen as a result of having particularly dry skin. When your skin is very dry it cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it. This could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate your skin. It's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. Contact dermatitis , a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may have a role in discoid eczema. Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of atopic eczema , which often happens in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever . However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families. Other possible triggers An outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an insect bite or a burn . Some medicines have been linked to discoid eczema. You should not stop taking any prescribed medicine without talking to the doctor who prescribed it for you. Dry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse, and sunny or damp (humid) environments may make your symptoms better. Treating discoid eczema Discoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medicines are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control. Treatments include: emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry topical corticosteroids – ointments and creams containing a steroid that are applied to the skin and may relieve severe symptoms antihistamines – medicines that can reduce itching There are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels. Additional medicine can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe. Occasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up. Find out more about treating discoid eczema . Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of eczema, it often runs in families and is linked to other conditions such as asthma and hay fever contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that happens when the skin comes into contact with a particular substance varicose eczema – a type of eczema that usually affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins Page last reviewed: 23 March 2023 Next review due: 23 March 2026 Next : Treatment"

Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. What to do while you’re waiting for treatment If you think you’ve dislocated your shoulder, there are some things you can do while you’re waiting for treatment. Do gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to your shoulder for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours put your arm in a sling or use a towel to support the affected arm take paracetamol for the pain – always follow the dosage advice on the packet Don’t do not move your upper arm do not try to put your arm back in yourself Information: How to make an arm sling The St John Ambulance website has more information about how to make an arm sling Treatment for a dislocated shoulder You will usually have an X-ray to check your shoulder is dislocated. If it is dislocated, a doctor will rotate your arm back into place. You will be given a local anaesthetic or a sedative so you do not feel any pain. Once your arm is back in place, you’ll be given a sling to support your arm Sometimes you may also need surgery to reduce your risk of dislocating the same shoulder again. Recovering from a dislocated shoulder It usually takes up to 12 weeks to recover from a dislocated shoulder. It may take up to 16 weeks to fully return to playing some sports, but for some recovery can take longer. You’ll need to wear a sling to support your arm for the first few weeks. A physiotherapist may recommend some regular shoulder exercises to help reduce pain and stiffness. Your doctor or physiotherapist will advise you on when you can return to daily tasks like driving or playing sport. Reducing the risk of dislocating your shoulder again Once you dislocate your shoulder, there’s an increased risk it could happen again. The risk depends on your age and how well your shoulder joint healed. You may be offered a scan to check if your shoulder has been damaged. It’s important to follow any advice you’re given by the hospital or doctor. The hospital may recommend regular physiotherapy appointments to help make your shoulder muscles stronger and reduce the risk of dislocating your shoulder again.

Tests for diverticular disease and diverticulitis The GP will ask questions to find out what's causing your symptoms. You may need a blood test or to give a poo sample to help find what's wrong. You may need further tests to confirm if you have diverticular disease or diverticulitis and rule out other conditions. Further tests you may have include: a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a thin tube with a small camera on it is used to check inside your bowels a CT scan Treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis Treatments that can help with the symptoms of diverticular disease include: painkillers such as paracetamol bulk-forming laxatives for constipation and diarrhoea medicines to help with stomach cramps (antispasmodics) Diverticulitis is treated with: antibiotics if the diverticulitis is caused by an infection painkillers such as paracetamol Things you can do to help with diverticular disease and diverticulitis If you have diverticular disease or diverticulitis there are things you can do to reduce the risk of your symptoms getting worse in the future. Do eat a healthy, balanced diet including whole grains, fruits and vegetables – there are no specific foods you need to avoid slowly increase how much fibre you eat if you do not eat much fibre – and make sure to also drink plenty of water stop smoking if you smoke maintain a healthy weight Don’t do not take NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) or opioid painkillers (such as codeine ) – they can cause stomach problems or constipation, and increase the risk of getting a hole (perforation) in your bowel Complications of diverticulitis Rarely, diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as: a build-up of pus (abscess) in your bowel a blockage in your bowel an opening from your bowel to another organ, such as your bladder, called a fistula a hole (perforation) in your bowel, which can cause a severe infection called peritonitis These problems can sometimes be treated with antibiotics or surgery. For example, you may need surgery to drain an abscess or remove an infected part of the bowel. Some people will need to have a colostomy (where your bowel is brought out of a hole in your tummy and a bag is attached to collect your poo). Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You or someone you care for: has severe tummy pain and is either vomiting, has a swollen tummy, or cannot poo or fart is bleeding heavily from their bottom is acting confused, has pale or blotchy skin, has a very high or low temperature, or is breathless or breathing rapidly – these could all be signs of sepsis Page last reviewed: 07 September 2023 Next review due: 07 September 2026"

Symptoms of Dupuytren's contracture Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers. It's common to have it in both hands at the same time. It tends to get slowly worse over many months or years. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand. It starts with lumps, dimples or ridges on your palm.

If it's severe and you cannot straighten your fingers or use your hand normally, a GP may refer you to a specialist for treatment. The specialist will explain what the benefits and risks of each treatment option are. They'll tell you what to expect afterwards, including advice on exercises to do. Your finger may not be completely straight after treatment, and might not be as strong and flexible as it used to be. The contracture could also come back after a few years. There are 3 main types of treatment: surgery to remove the affected tissue in the hand (fasciectomy) using a needle to make small cuts in the affected tissue (needle fasciotomy) surgery to remove the affected tissue and skin (dermofasciectomy) Surgery to straighten the fingers Fasciectomy A cut is made along your palm and finger so the surgeon can straighten it. general anaesthetic (you're asleep) or local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed) you can leave hospital the same day recovery time: 4 to 12 weeks lowest risk of contracture coming back risks include bleeding, numbness and infection Using a needle to straighten the fingers Needle fasciotomy A needle is inserted into several places along your palm and finger to loosen and straighten it. local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed) you can leave hospital the same day recovery time: up to 2 weeks contracture more likely to come back than with surgery risks include a cut opening up in your skin, pain and numbness Using surgery and a skin graft to straighten the fingers Dermofasciectomy Similar to a fasciectomy, except an additional area of skin is removed; a skin graft from elsewhere in the body is used to replace the removed skin. general anaesthetic (you're asleep) or local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed) 2 procedures are needed – 1 to straighten the fingers and then another procedure to add the skin graft contractures less likely to come back than with a standard fasciectomy but recovery times can be longer risks include bleeding, numbness and infection Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have Dupuytren's contracture, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS treatment for Dupuytren's contracture near you Causes of Dupuytren's contracture Dupuytren's contracture happens when the tissue under the skin near your fingers becomes thicker and less flexible. The exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to: having a family history of the condition smoking drinking lots of alcohol having diabetes or epilepsy It's not known if you can prevent it or stop it coming back.

Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You have symptoms of DVT (deep vein thrombosis), such as pain and swelling, and: breathlessness chest pain DVT can be very serious because blood clots can travel to your lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism . A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening and needs treatment straight away. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Who is more likely to get DVT (deep vein thrombosis) A DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is more likely to happen if you: are over 60 are overweight smoke have had DVT before take the contraceptive pill or HRT have cancer or heart failure have varicose veins There are also some times when you have a higher chance of getting DVT. These include if you: are staying in or recently left hospital – especially if you cannot move around much (like after an operation) are confined to bed go on a long journey (more than 3 hours) by plane, car or train are pregnant or if you've had a baby in the previous 6 weeks are dehydrated Sometimes DVT can happen for no obvious reason. How DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is diagnosed If a doctor thinks you have DVT (deep vein thrombosis), you should be referred to hospital within 24 hours for an ultrasound scan. The scan shows whether blood is flowing normally through the vein. You may also have an X-ray of the vein (venogram). For this, you'll be injected with a dye to show where the blood clot is. Treatment of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) You may have an injection of a blood-thinning medicine called heparin while you're waiting for an ultrasound scan to see if you have a DVT (deep vein thrombosis). The main treatments include: blood-thinning medicines, such as warfarin or rivaroxaban – you'll probably need to take these for at least 3 months surgery to remove blood clots or stop them forming If you get a DVT when you're pregnant , you'll have injections for the rest of the pregnancy and until your baby is 6 weeks old. Recovery from DVT (deep vein thrombosis) There are things you can do to help you recover from DVT (deep vein thrombosis). After you leave hospital, you'll be encouraged to: walk regularly keep your affected leg raised when you're sitting delay any flights or long journeys until at least 2 weeks after you start taking blood-thinning medicine How to prevent DVT (deep vein thrombosis) There are things you can do to lower your chance of getting DVT (deep vein thrombosis). Do stay a healthy weight stay active – taking regular walks can help drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration – DVT is more likely if you're dehydrated Don’t do not sit still for long periods of time – get up and move around every hour or so do not cross your legs while you're sitting do not smoke do not drink lots of alcohol Going on a long journey If you're travelling for 3 hours or more by plane, train or car, there are things you can do during the journey to lower your chances of getting DVT. These include: wearing loose clothing drinking plenty of water avoiding alcohol walking around when possible Going into hospital If you go into hospital, your healthcare team should check if there's a higher chance you'll get DVT. If they think you're more likely to get DVT, you may be given treatment to prevent it, such as medicine or compression stockings (knee-high elastic socks that help your blood circulation), while you're in hospital. You may continue treatment after you leave hospital because a blood clot can happen weeks later. You can also help protect yourself against DVT while you're in hospital by: staying active and walking around if you can moving your toes (up and down) and ankles (in circles) if you have to stay in bed – your healthcare team may give you some exercises to do Page last reviewed: 22 March 2023 Next review due: 22 March 2026"

    "title": "Restricted growth (dwarfism)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/restricted-growth/",
    "text": "Restricted growth (dwarfism) Restricted growth, also called dwarfism or short stature, is when you are shorter than most people. It has many different causes. Treatment depends on what's causing it. Information: This information is about restricted growth in children and adults, not about having a small baby. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have more information about having a small baby Symptoms of restricted growth The main symptom of restricted growth is being short. It's sometimes defined as being less than 147 centimetres (4 feet 10 inches) tall as an adult. Restricted growth can be: proportionate, where your arms and legs are the expected size compared to the rest of your body disproportionate, where parts of your body grow differently (for example, having short arms and legs compared to the rest of your body) Symptoms of restricted growth might be noticed when a baby is born, or later when a child is not growing as expected for their age. You or your child may also have other symptoms, depending on what's causing the restricted growth. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your child is not growing as expected for their age Causes of restricted growth Restricted growth is usually genetic, meaning it is caused by the genes passed on from your parents. This can just be because your parents are short themselves, or because of a genetic condition. Restricted growth can also be caused by hormone deficiencies or poor diet (malnutrition). Causes of restricted growth include: a lack of the hormone that controls growth (growth hormone deficiency) rare genetic conditions such as Turner syndrome , Noonan syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome problems affecting bone development (skeletal dysplasias), such as achondroplasia How restricted growth is diagnosed Restricted growth is often diagnosed when a baby is born. Sometimes it's not diagnosed until later, when a child is not growing as expected for their age. If a doctor thinks you or your child may have restricted growth, they may recommend tests such as: blood tests genetic tests X-rays Screening in pregnancy If you're more likely to have a baby with restricted growth, for example because you or someone in your family has a genetic condition, you may be offered screening tests before you give birth. Treatment for restricted growth The main treatment for restricted growth is growth hormone medicine. Surgery to increase the length of your arms or legs is sometimes done, but this is rare. You may also need treatment for other symptoms of your condition. Growth hormone Growth hormone is used to increase height in children with restricted growth, or children who are not growing as expected for their age. It can treat many different types of restricted growth, but it is not normally used to treat a problem with bone development (such as achondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias). Growth hormone medicines include: somatropin – a daily injection used to treat many causes of restricted growth somatrogon – a weekly injection, only used if you have a lack of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency) How well treatment works depends on what's causing the restricted growth. Treatment usually continues until your child stops growing or reaches their target height. Treatment for skeletal dysplasias If you have a skeletal dysplasia such as achondroplasia, treatment usually aims to relieve any other symptoms you have, rather than increase your height. Treatments you may need include: physiotherapy for problems with movement and pain orthodontics for problems with your teeth treatment for ear infections and sleep apnoea surgery, for example to straighten bowed legs, or to straighten or reduce pressure on your spine How restricted growth affects your life How restricted growth affects your life depends on what causes it, what other symptoms you have, and your treatment. With treatment, some people with restricted growth conditions reach an average or close to average adult height. But others will be significantly below average height as an adult. Most people with restricted growth conditions have an average life expectancy. But some restricted growth conditions can affect how long you live. Everyday life with restricted growth If you're much shorter than most people, you may need adaptations to help you with: doing everyday activities at home getting around and driving accessing education and work finding clothes that fit taking part in sports and other activities Depending on how your condition affects you, you may be eligible for disability benefits to help with the costs of adaptations and support.

    "text": "Overview - Dyslexia Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Management Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that mainly causes problems with reading, writing and spelling. It's a specific learning difficulty, which means it causes problems with certain abilities used for learning, such as reading and writing. Unlike a learning disability , intelligence isn't affected. It's estimated up to 1 in every 10 people in the UK has some degree of dyslexia. Dyslexia is a lifelong problem that can present challenges on a daily basis, but support is available to improve reading and writing skills and help those with the problem be successful at school and work. What are the signs of dyslexia? Signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how to read and write. A person with dyslexia may: read and write very slowly confuse the order of letters in words be confused by letters that look similar and write letters the wrong way round (such as \"b\" and \"d\") have poor or inconsistent spelling understand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that's written down find it hard to carry out a sequence of directions struggle with planning and organisation But people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem solving. Read more about the symptoms of dyslexia . Getting help If you think your child may have dyslexia, the first step is to speak to their teacher or their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) about your concerns. They may be able to offer additional support to help your child if necessary. If your child continues to have problems despite extra support, you or the school may want to consider requesting an in-depth assessment from a specialist in assessing specific learning difficulties (SpLD), an educational psychologist or a speech and language therapist. This can be arranged through the school, or you can request a private assessment by contacting: an educational psychologist directly (see the directory of chartered psychologists on the British Psychological Society's website ) a voluntary organisation that can arrange an assessment or share details of a qualified assessor in your area, such as the British Dyslexia Association , The Dyslexia Association , or Patoss Adults who wish to be assessed for dyslexia should contact a local or national dyslexia association for advice. Read more about how dyslexia is diagnosed . Support for people with dyslexia If your child has dyslexia, they'll probably need extra educational support from their school. With appropriate support, there's usually no reason your child can't go to a mainstream school, although a small number of children may benefit from attending a specialist school. Techniques and support that may help your child include: occasional 1-to-1 teaching or lessons in a small group with a specialist teacher phonics (a way of teaching children to identify and process the smaller sounds that make up words) combined with other techniques technology like computers and speech-recognition software that may make it easier for your child to read and write when they're a bit older Schools and colleges must offer support to students with a specific learning difficulty like dyslexia, and have access to specialist staff who are trained in helping students with special education needs. Assistive technologies such as speech-recognition software, word processors and electronic organisers can be useful for adults, too. Employers are required to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace to help people with dyslexia, such as allowing extra time for certain tasks. Read more about how dyslexia is managed . Support groups As well as national dyslexia charities such as the British Dyslexia Association (BDA) , there are several local dyslexia associations listed on the BDA website . These are independently registered charities that run workshops and help to provide local support and access to information. What causes dyslexia? People with dyslexia find it difficult to recognise the different sounds that make up words and relate these to letters. Dyslexia isn't related to a person's general level of intelligence. Children and adults of all intellectual abilities can be affected by dyslexia. The exact cause of dyslexia is unknown, but it often appears to run in families. It's thought certain genes inherited from your parents may act together in a way that affects how some parts of the brain develop during early life.

    "text": "Dyspraxia (developmental co-ordination disorder) in adults Dyspraxia, also known as developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD), is a common disorder that affects movement and co-ordination. Dyspraxia does not affect your intelligence. It can affect your co-ordination skills – such as tasks requiring balance, playing sports or learning to drive a car. Dyspraxia can also affect your fine motor skills, such as writing or using small objects. This page focuses on dyspraxia in adults. You can also read about childhood dyspraxia . Symptoms of dyspraxia Symptoms of dyspraxia can vary between individuals and may change over time. You may find routine tasks difficult. If you have dyspraxia it may affect: your co-ordination, balance and movement how you learn new skills, think, and remember information at work and home your daily living skills, such as dressing or preparing meals your ability to write, type, draw and grasp small objects how you function in social situations how you deal with your emotions time management, planning and personal organisation skills Dyspraxia should not be confused with other disorders affecting movement, such as cerebral palsy and stroke . It can affect people of all intellectual abilities. When to see a GP See a GP if you think you may have undiagnosed dyspraxia or problems with your co-ordination. It's a good idea to keep a diary of your symptoms. The GP may refer you to a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist for tests. They'll assess your movements and how your symptoms are affecting you before making a diagnosis. If you have dyspraxia, you may also have other conditions, such as: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) dyslexia autism spectrum disorder difficulty learning or understanding maths (dyscalculia) depression or anxiety Causes of dyspraxia It's not known what causes dyspraxia. You may be at a higher risk of developing it if you were born prematurely. Dyspraxia is more common in men and often runs in families. Treatment for dyspraxia There is no cure for dyspraxia but there are therapies that can help with daily living, such as: occupational therapy – to help you find practical ways to remain independent and manage everyday tasks such as writing or preparing food cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave It may also help if you: keep fit – you may find regular exercise helps with co-ordination, reduces feelings of fatigue and prevents you gaining weight learn how to use a computer or laptop if writing by hand is difficult use a calendar, diary or app to improve your organisation learn how to talk positively about your challenges and how you've overcome them get support from programmes such as Access to Work from Jobcentre Plus Support for people living with dyspraxia Dyspraxia can have a big effect on your life. It might help to talk to others with dyspraxia. Dyspraxic Adults is an online forum for adults with dyspraxia to chat, discuss challenges and share experiences.

    "text": "Overview - Developmental co-ordination disorder (dyspraxia) in children Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, is a condition affecting physical co-ordination. It causes a child to perform less well than expected in daily activities for their age, and appear to move clumsily. This topic is about DCD in children, although the condition often causes continued problems into adulthood. Find out more about DCD in adults . Symptoms of DCD Early developmental milestones of crawling, walking, self-feeding and dressing may be delayed in young children with DCD. Drawing, writing and performance in sports are also usually behind what is expected for their age. Although signs of the condition are present from an early age, children vary widely in their rate of development. This means a definite diagnosis of DCD does not usually happen until a child with the condition is 5 years old or more. Find out more about symptoms of DCD in children . When to seek medical advice If you're concerned about your child's health or development, talk to a GP or health visitor, or speak to a nurse, doctor or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) at your child's school. They may refer your child to an occupational therapist, paediatrician, or another health professional who can assess them and try to identify any developmental problems. Find out more about diagnosing DCD in children . Causes of DCD Doing co-ordinated movements is a complex process that involves many different nerves and parts of the brain. Any problem in this process could potentially lead to difficulties with movement and co-ordination. It's not usually clear why co-ordination doesn't develop as well as other abilities in children with DCD. However, a number of risk factors that can increase a child's likelihood of developing DCD have been identified. These include: being born prematurely, before the 37th week of pregnancy being born with a low birth weight having a family history of DCD, although it is not clear exactly which genes may be involved in the condition the mother drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs while pregnant Treating DCD There's no cure for DCD, but a number of therapies can help children to manage their problems. These include: being taught ways to do activities they find difficult, such as breaking down difficult movements into smaller parts and practicing them regularly adapting tasks to make them easier, such as using special grips on pens and pencils so they are easier to hold Although DCD does not affect how intelligent a child is, it can make it more difficult for them to learn and they may need extra help to keep up at school. Treatment for DCD will be tailored to your child and usually involves a number of different healthcare professionals working together. Although the physical co-ordination of a child with DCD will remain below average, this may be less of a problem as they get older and develop coping strategies. Some children may continue to have problems. However, difficulties in school – particularly producing written work – can become much more prominent and require extra help from parents and teachers. Find out more about treating DCD in children . Dyspraxia or DCD? While many people in the UK use the term dyspraxia to refer to the difficulties with movement and co-ordination that first develop in young children, this term is used less often by healthcare professionals. Instead, most healthcare professionals use the term developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) to describe the condition. This term is generally preferred by healthcare professionals because dyspraxia can have several meanings. For example, dyspraxia can be used to describe movement difficulties that happen later in life because of damage to the brain, such as from a stroke or head injury . Some healthcare professionals may also use the term specific developmental disorder of motor function (SDDMF) to refer to DCD.

    "text": "Early or delayed puberty Puberty is when a child's body begins to develop and change as they become an adult. Signs of puberty include girls developing breasts and starting periods , and boys developing a larger penis and testicles, a deeper voice and a more muscular appearance. The average age for girls to start puberty is 11, while for boys the average age is 12. But it's perfectly normal for puberty to begin at any point between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys. There's not usually any need to worry if puberty does not start around the average age, but it's a good idea to speak to your GP for advice if it starts before 8 or has not started by around 14. In some cases, early puberty or delayed puberty could be a sign of an underlying condition that may need to be treated. Early puberty Early puberty, also called precocious puberty, is when: girls have signs of puberty before 8 years of age boys have signs of puberty before 9 years of age Some girls and boys may develop certain signs of puberty at a young age, but not others. For example, girls may start periods before the age of 8 but have no breast development. See your GP if this happens to your child. Causes of early puberty It's not always clear what causes early puberty. It may just be a tendency that runs in your family. Occasionally it can be caused by: a problem in the brain, such as a brain tumour damage to the brain as a result of an infection, surgery or radiotherapy a problem with the ovaries or thyroid gland a genetic disorder, such as McCune-Albright syndrome – read more about McCune-Albright syndrome on the MedlinePlus website Early puberty mostly affects girls and often has no obvious cause. It's less common in boys and may be more likely to be associated with an underlying problem. Tests and treatments for early puberty Your GP may refer you to a specialist if they think there could be an underlying cause that needs to be investigated. Tests that may be carried out include: a blood test to check hormone levels a hand X-ray to help determine likely adult height an ultrasound scan or MRI scan to check for problems such as tumours Early puberty can be treated by: treating any underlying cause using medication to reduce hormone levels and pause sexual development for a few years Treatment with medication is usually only recommended if it's thought early puberty will cause emotional or physical problems, such as short height in adulthood or early periods in girls, which may cause significant distress. Delayed puberty Delayed puberty is when: boys have no signs of testicular development by 14 years of age girls have not started to develop breasts by 13 years of age, or they have developed breasts but their periods have not started by 15 Causes of delayed puberty It's not always clear what causes delayed puberty. It may just be a tendency that runs in your family. Delayed puberty is generally more common in boys. Occasionally it can be caused by: a long-term illness, such as cystic fibrosis , diabetes or kidney disease malnutrition , possibly from an eating disorder or a condition such as cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease a problem with the ovaries, testes, thyroid gland or pituitary gland differences in sex development , such as androgen insensitivity syndrome a genetic condition, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Kallmann syndrome – read more about Kallmann syndrome on the MedlinePlus website Tests and treatments for delayed puberty Your GP may refer you to a specialist if they think there could be an underlying cause of delayed puberty that needs to be investigated.

Delayed puberty can be treated by: treating any underlying cause using medication for a few months to increase hormone levels and trigger the start of puberty Treatment with medication is usually only recommended if the lack of development is causing problems, such as significant distress.

    "text": "Overview - Ectopic pregnancy Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. The fallopian tubes are the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb. If an egg gets stuck in them, it won't develop into a baby and your health may be at risk if the pregnancy continues. Unfortunately, it's not possible to save the pregnancy. It usually has to be removed using medicine or an operation. In the UK, around 1 in every 90 pregnancies is ectopic. This is around 11,000 pregnancies a year. Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy doesn't always cause symptoms and may only be detected during a routine pregnancy scan. If you do have symptoms, they tend to develop between the 4th and 12th week of pregnancy. Symptoms can include a combination of: a missed period and other signs of pregnancy tummy pain low down on one side vaginal bleeding or a brown watery discharge pain in the tip of your shoulder discomfort when peeing or pooing But these symptoms aren't necessarily a sign of a serious problem. They can sometimes be caused by other problems, such as a stomach bug . Read more about the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy . When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if you have a combination of any of the above symptoms and you might be pregnant – even if you haven't had a positive pregnancy test . An ectopic pregnancy can be serious, so it's important to get advice right away. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and you'll usually need to do a pregnancy test to determine if you could have an ectopic pregnancy. You may be referred to a specialist early pregnancy clinic for further assessment, where an ultrasound scan and blood tests may be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. Read more about ectopic pregnancy tests . When to get emergency help Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you experience a combination of: a sharp, sudden and intense pain in your tummy feeling very dizzy or fainting feeling sick looking very pale These symptoms could mean that your fallopian tube has split open (ruptured). This is very serious and surgery to repair the fallopian tube needs to be carried out as soon as possible. A rupture can be life threatening, but fortunately they're uncommon and treatable, if dealt with quickly. Deaths from ruptures are extremely rare in the UK. How an ectopic pregnancy is treated There are 3 main treatments for an ectopic pregnancy: expectant management – you're carefully monitored and 1 of the treatments below is used if the fertilised egg doesn't dissolve by itself medicine – an injection of a powerful medicine called methotrexate is used to stop the pregnancy growing surgery – keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is performed under general anaesthetic to remove the fertilised egg, usually along with the affected fallopian tube You'll be told about the benefits and risks of each option. In many cases, a particular treatment will be recommended based on your symptoms and the results of the tests you have. Some treatments may reduce your chances of being able to conceive naturally in the future, although most women will still be able to get pregnant. Talk to your doctor about this. Read more about treating an ectopic pregnancy . Help and support after an ectopic pregnancy Losing a pregnancy can be devastating, and many women feel the same sense of grief as if they had lost a family member or partner. It's not uncommon for these feelings to last several months, although they usually improve with time. Make sure you give yourself and your partner time to grieve. If you or your partner are struggling to come to terms with your loss, you may benefit from professional support or counselling . Speak to your GP about this. Support groups for people who have been affected by loss of a pregnancy can also help. These include: The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust Ectopic Pregnancy Foundation Miscarriage Association Cruse Bereavement Care Read more about dealing with loss and find bereavement support services in your area . Trying for another baby You may want to try for another baby when you and your partner feel physically and emotionally ready. You'll probably be advised to wait until you've had at least 2 periods after treatment before trying again to allow yourself to recover. If you were treated with methotrexate, it's usually recommended that you wait at least 3 months because the medicine could harm your baby if you become pregnant during this time. Most women who have had an ectopic pregnancy will be able to get pregnant again, even if they've had a fallopian tube removed. Occasionally, it may be necessary to use fertility treatment such as IVF . The chances of having another ectopic pregnancy are higher if you've had one before, but the risk is still small. If you do become pregnant again, it's a good idea to let your GP know as soon as possible so early scans can be carried out to check everything is OK. What can cause an ectopic pregnancy? In many cases, it's not clear why a woman has an ectopic pregnancy. Sometimes it happens when there's a problem with the fallopian tubes, such as them being narrow or blocked. The following are all associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy: pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – inflammation of the female reproductive system, usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) previous ectopic pregnancy – the risk of having another ectopic pregnancy is around 10% previous surgery on your fallopian tubes – such as an unsuccessful female sterilisation procedure fertility treatment, such as IVF – taking medicine to stimulate ovulation (the release of an egg) can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy becoming pregnant while using an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) for contraception – it's rare to get pregnant while using these, but if you do you're more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy smoking increasing age – the risk is highest for pregnant women aged over 35 You can't always prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but you can reduce your risk by using a condom when not trying for a baby to protect yourself against STIs, and by stopping smoking if you smoke.

    "text": "Ectropion Ectropion is where the lower eyelid droops away from the eye and turns outwards. It's not usually serious, but can be uncomfortable. Ectropion mainly affects the lower eyelid and can happen in 1 or both eyes. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/256885/view The drooping eyelid can disrupt the drainage of tears, which can make the eyes: sore, red and irritated water excessively feel very dry and gritty more vulnerable to bacterial infections, such as conjunctivitis If ectropion is severe and not treated, it's possible to develop a corneal ulcer (a sore on the eye's surface) that could affect your vision. But this is rare. Ectropion is different from entropion , which is where the eyelid turns inwards, towards the eye. When to get medical advice See a GP if you think you have ectropion. They'll be able to diagnose the problem by examining your eye, and can refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for further assessment and treatment, if necessary. Contact a GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest A&E , if your eye is very red and painful or you have other symptoms, such as reduced vision or sensitivity to light. This could be a sign of a more serious problem that requires urgent treatment. Causes of ectropion Ectropion is usually associated with ageing. It can happen as the tissues and muscles of the eyelids become weaker as you get older. Less common causes of ectropion include: a problem with the nerves that control the eyelid – this is often seen in a type of facial paralysis called Bell's palsy a lump, cyst or tumour on the eyelid damage to the skin around the eyelid as a result of an injury, a burn , a skin condition such as contact dermatitis , or previous surgery Rarely, ectropion can be present from birth if the muscles under the eyelid do not develop properly. Treating ectropion Treatment for ectropion depends on its severity and the underlying cause. If it's mild, it may not need any treatment. If ectropion is causing minor problems, a GP or eye specialist can advise you about ways to relieve your symptoms and look after your eyes at home. Severe ectropion may require an operation to correct the problem. Looking after your eyes Your doctor may recommend using eyedrops during the day and eye ointment at night to reduce irritation and keep your eye lubricated. Try not to wipe your eyes excessively, as this can pull on the eyelid and make the problem worse. If you need to wipe your eyes, it's best to do this gently and wipe upwards and inwards (towards your nose). If an operation is recommended, you may be advised to tape your eyelids closed at night with special skin tape as a temporary measure to help protect your eyes while you wait to have surgery. Surgery Surgery for ectropion is a relatively minor procedure that takes up to 45 minutes for each eyelid, and is usually carried out under local anaesthetic . It's normally performed on an outpatient basis, which means you will not need to stay in hospital overnight. You should arrange for a friend or family member to take you home. Various different techniques can be used, depending on the severity of ectropion and its underlying cause. Following surgery, a pad will be placed over your eye to protect it. This will need to remain in place for about a day. A course of antibiotic and steroid drops or ointment will usually be prescribed to help prevent infection and reduce inflammation. You'll have a follow-up appointment a week or two after your operation. This is to check on the position of your eyelid and sometimes to remove any stitches.

Symptoms of contact dermatitis Contact dermatitis causes the skin to become itchy, blistered, dry and cracked. Lighter skin can become red, and darker skin can become dark brown, purple or grey. This reaction usually occurs within a few hours or days of exposure to an irritant or allergen. Symptoms can affect any part of the body but most commonly the hands and face. Read about symptoms of contact dermatitis Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/506528/view When to see a pharmacist Speak to a pharmacist if your contact dermatitis is troubling you. They can recommend treatments such as emollients (moisturisers) , which you rub on your skin to stop it becoming dry. Find a pharmacy When to see a GP See a GP if you have persistent, recurrent or severe symptoms of contact dermatitis. They can try to identify the cause and suggest appropriate treatments. A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) for further tests if: the substance causing your contact dermatitis cannot be identified your symptoms are not responding to treatment Read about diagnosing contact dermatitis Causes of contact dermatitis Contact dermatitis can be caused by: an irritant – a substance that directly damages the outer layer of skin an allergen – a substance that causes the immune system to respond in a way that affects the skin Contact dermatitis is most commonly caused by irritants such as soaps and detergents, solvents or regular contact with water. Allergic contact dermatitis is less common and can be triggered by an allergic reaction to substances found in certain products, such as cosmetics, or some metals, including nickel. Handling raw, uncooked fruit and vegetables may also trigger allergic contact dermatitis in some people.

These then quickly join up to form larger patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size. On lighter skin these patches will be pink or red. On darker skin these patches can be a dark brown or they can be paler than the skin around them. Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night. Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for ringworm . You may just have 1 patch of discoid eczema, but most people get several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry. Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include: the patches oozing a lot of fluid a yellow crust developing over the patches the skin around the patches becoming hot, swollen and tender or painful feeling sick feeling hot or shivery feeling unwell When to seek medical advice See a pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema. They can recommend a suitable treatment. You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected. You may need to use an antibiotic cream or, in severe cases, take antibiotics as a tablet or capsule. A GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions. A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist) if they're unsure of the diagnosis or if you need a patch test. Causes of discoid eczema The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may happen as a result of having particularly dry skin. When your skin is very dry it cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it. This could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate your skin. It's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. Contact dermatitis , a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may have a role in discoid eczema. Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of atopic eczema , which often happens in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever . However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families. Other possible triggers An outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an insect bite or a burn . Some medicines have been linked to discoid eczema. You should not stop taking any prescribed medicine without talking to the doctor who prescribed it for you. Dry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse, and sunny or damp (humid) environments may make your symptoms better. Treating discoid eczema Discoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medicines are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control. Treatments include: emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry topical corticosteroids – ointments and creams containing a steroid that are applied to the skin and may relieve severe symptoms antihistamines – medicines that can reduce itching There are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels. Additional medicine can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe. Occasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up. Find out more about treating discoid eczema . Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of eczema, it often runs in families and is linked to other conditions such as asthma and hay fever contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that happens when the skin comes into contact with a particular substance varicose eczema – a type of eczema that usually affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins Page last reviewed: 23 March 2023 Next review due: 23 March 2026 Next : Treatment"

On black or brown skin it tends to look dark brown, purple or grey and can sometimes be more difficult to see. There may be periods when these symptoms improve and periods when they are more severe. Your legs may become swollen, especially at the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs. Some people also have other symptoms, such as: tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis) small, white scars (atrophie blanche) pain eczema affecting other parts of the body If varicose eczema is not treated, leg ulcers can develop. These are wounds that form where the skin has become damaged. When to get medical advice See a GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. Your doctor will often be able to make a diagnosis simply by looking at your skin. A GP will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema. To help make a diagnosis, a GP may want to know if you have ever had health conditions such as: varicose veins – swollen and enlarged veins DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – a blood clot in the veins of your legs leg ulcers – areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue surgery or injury to your legs A GP may also check the pulse in your feet and may do an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you. The ABPI test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries – in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use. Referral to a specialist You may be referred to a hospital specialist for further tests. You might see a doctor or surgeon who specialises in conditions affecting blood vessels (vascular specialist), or a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist). Causes of varicose eczema Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in the leg veins. When small valves in the veins stop working properly, it's difficult for blood to be pushed upwards against gravity and it can leak backwards. This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It's thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid. Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins are not working properly. Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are some factors that increase the chance of this happening, including: sex – varicose eczema is more common in women obesity – this can increase the pressure in your leg veins pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins a family history of venous insufficiency (where the veins in your legs have trouble sending blood back to your heart) not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation of blood in your leg veins having previously had DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – blood clots that develop in leg veins which can damage the valves in your veins increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation Treating varicose eczema For most people, treatment involves a combination of: self-help measures – including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it from becoming dry topical corticosteroids – ointments or creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms compression stockings – specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that squeeze your legs tightly at the foot and ankle and become looser further up your leg, helping to improve your circulation If these treatments do not help, a GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) in case there's another cause for your symptoms, or if they're concerned you may also have contact dermatitis . If you have varicose veins, you may be referred to a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist) who can talk to you about the treatment options for varicose veins .

    "text": "Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18) Edwards’ syndrome, also called trisomy 18, is a rare genetic condition that cannot currently be cured. It’s often diagnosed in pregnancy or soon after a baby is born. Symptoms of Edwards’ syndrome Newborn babies with Edwards’ syndrome may have some, or all, of the following symptoms: low birth weight ears in a low position on their head cleft lip or palate club foot problems with their heart, kidneys or spine problems with their breathing or digestion Each person with Edwards’ syndrome is different, and there are also different types which can cause different symptoms. Causes of Edwards’ syndrome Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18) is a genetic condition, caused by an extra chromosome in the body’s cells. With trisomy 18 there are 3 copies of chromosome 18 rather than the usual 2. It's not possible to prevent Edwards' syndrome. It happens by chance and is not linked to anything you did before or during pregnancy. Your chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome increases as you get older. There's also a small increased risk if you’ve already had a pregnancy or baby affected by Edwards’ syndrome. Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome Edwards' syndrome is usually screened for in pregnancy. It's also possible to test for it after your baby is born. Screening for Edwards’ syndrome If you’re pregnant, you’ll be offered a screening test to find out your chance of having a baby with Edwards’ syndrome . At 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy, you’ll be invited to a combined test. This is a combined blood test and ultrasound scan, sometimes called the 12-week scan . If you missed your combined test or it was not possible to complete it, you should be offered a quadruple blood screening test. You can have this test between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. If screening finds something, you’ll be referred to a specialist and may be offered more scans and tests, such as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) . The amniocentesis and CVS tests will be able to tell you if your baby definitely has Edwards’ syndrome, and what this might mean for you and your baby. It's your choice if you want to have any of these tests or not. They're the best way to find out if your baby could have Edwards' syndrome, but not everyone wants this information. Talk to your midwife about your options. Get support Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) has information about screening tests and how you might feel if you're told your baby has, or might have, a condition. Call the helpline on 020 7713 7486 (Monday to Friday, 10am to 5.30pm). Types of Edwards' syndrome There are 3 types of Edwards’ syndrome (trisomy 18): full trisomy 18 – the most common and most serious type mosaic trisomy 18 – a less common type, which may have less serious symptoms partial trisomy 18 – a very rare type, which may have less serious symptoms Tests during pregnancy will not always be able to tell you what symptoms your baby will have. After your baby is born, you may be offered further tests to help you understand the type of Edwards’ syndrome they have. Information: Find out more SOFT UK: what is trisomy 18 - understanding the basics Living with Edwards' syndrome Although Edwards’ syndrome affects everyone differently, some types can cause more serious health conditions and affect how long a person born with Edwards' syndrome lives. Most babies with full Edwards’ syndrome (full trisomy 18) die before or shortly after being born. Babies born with mosaic or partial trisomy 18 may have fewer health symptoms, and some will grow up to become adults. Everyone with Edwards' syndrome will have some level of learning disability and health challenges. Some people will be more independent and be able to do things like get a job. Others might need more regular care. But, like everyone, people with Edwards' syndrome have: their own personalities things they like and dislike things that make them who they are Having a child with Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18) Three families share their experience of having a child with Edwards' syndrome, also called trisomy 18.

    "title": "Ehlers-Danlos syndromes",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndromes/",
    "text": "Ehlers-Danlos syndromes Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissue. Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. Symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) There are several types of EDS that may share some symptoms. These include: an increased range of joint movement ( joint hypermobility ) stretchy skin fragile skin that breaks or bruises easily EDS can affect people in different ways. For some, the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling. The different types of EDS are caused by faults in certain genes that make connective tissue weaker. Depending on the type of EDS, the faulty gene may have been inherited from 1 parent or both parents. Sometimes the faulty gene is not inherited, but occurs in the person for the first time. Some of the rare, severe types can be life threatening. Main types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) There are 13 types of EDS, most of which are rare. Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common type. Other types of EDS include classical EDS, vascular EDS and kyphoscoliotic EDS. The EDS Support UK website has more information about the different types of EDS Hypermobile EDS People with hEDS may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily joint pain and clicking joints extreme tiredness (fatigue) skin that bruises easily digestive problems, such as heartburn and constipation dizziness and an increased heart rate after standing up problems with internal organs, such as mitral valve problems or organ prolapse problems with bladder control ( urinary incontinence ) Currently, there are no tests to confirm whether someone has hEDS. The diagnosis is made based on a person's medical history and a physical examination. Classical EDS Classical EDS (cEDS) is less common than hypermobile EDS and tends to affect the skin more. People with cEDS may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily stretchy skin fragile skin that can split easily, especially over the forehead, knees, shins and elbows smooth, velvety skin that bruises easily wounds that are slow to heal and leave wide scars hernias and organ prolapse Vascular EDS Vascular EDS (vEDS) is a rare type of EDS and is often considered to be the most serious. It affects the blood vessels and internal organs, which can cause them to split open and lead to life-threatening bleeding. People with vEDS may have: skin that bruises very easily thin skin with visible small blood vessels, particularly on the upper chest and legs fragile blood vessels that can bulge or tear, resulting in serious internal bleeding a risk of organ problems, such as the bowel tearing, the womb tearing (in late pregnancy) and partial collapse of the lung hypermobile fingers and toes, unusual facial features (such as a thin nose and lips, large eyes and small earlobes), varicose veins and delayed wound healing Kyphoscoliotic EDS Kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS) is rare. People with kEDS may have: curvature of the spine – this starts in early childhood and often gets worse in the teenage years joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily weak muscle tone from childhood (hypotonia) – this may cause a delay in sitting and walking, or difficulty walking if symptoms get worse fragile eyes that can easily be damaged soft, velvety skin that is stretchy, bruises easily and scars Hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) Some people have problems caused by hypermobility, but do not have any of the specific EDS conditions. They may be diagnosed with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), which is treated in the same way as hEDS. Getting medical advice See a GP if you have several troublesome symptoms of EDS. You do not usually need to worry if you only have a few symptoms and they're not causing any problems. Joint hypermobility, for example, is relatively common, affecting around 1 in 30 people. It's unlikely to be caused by EDS if you do not have any other symptoms. The GP may refer you to a joint specialist (rheumatologist) if you have problems with your joints and they suspect EDS. If there's a possibility you may have 1 of the rare types of EDS, the GP can refer you to your local genetics service for an assessment. The genetics specialist will ask about your medical history, family history, assess your symptoms and may carry out a genetic blood test to confirm the diagnosis. If further investigation is needed, your hospital doctor can refer you to a specialist EDS diagnostic service based in Sheffield or London – see the Annabelle's Challenge website for more information . Treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) There's no specific treatment for EDS, but it's possible to manage many of the symptoms with support and advice. People with EDS may also benefit from support from a number of different healthcare professionals. For example: a physiotherapist can teach you exercises to help strengthen your joints, avoid injuries and manage pain an occupational therapist can help you manage daily activities and give advice on equipment that may help you counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be useful if you're struggling to cope with long-term pain for certain types of EDS, regular scans carried out in hospital can detect problems with internal organs genetic counselling can help you learn more about the cause of your condition, how it's inherited, and what the chances are of passing it on to your children Your GP or consultant can refer you to these services. Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndromes near you Living with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) It's important to be careful about activities that put a lot of strain on your joints or put you at risk of injury. But it's also important not to be overprotective and avoid living an otherwise normal life. Advice will depend on which type of EDS you have and how it affects you: you may be advised to avoid some activities entirely, such as heavy lifting and contact sports for some activities you may need to wear appropriate protection and be taught how to reduce the strain on your joints lower-risk activities, such as swimming or pilates , may be recommended to help you stay fit and healthy if fatigue is a problem, you can be taught ways to conserve your energy and pace your activities How Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are inherited EDS can be inherited, but it happen by chance in someone without a family history of the condition. The 2 main ways EDS is inherited are: autosomal dominant inheritance (hypermobile, classical and vascular EDS) – the faulty gene that causes EDS is passed on by 1 parent and there's a 1 in 2 chance of each of their children developing the condition autosomal recessive inheritance (kyphoscoliotic EDS) – the faulty gene is inherited from both parents and there's a 1 in 4 chance of each of their children developing the condition A person with EDS can only pass on the same type of EDS to their children. For example, the children of someone with hypermobile EDS cannot inherit vascular EDS. The severity of the condition can vary within the same family. More information The following websites provide more information, advice and support for people with EDS and their families: Ehlers-Danlos Support UK – you can also call their free helpline on 0800 907 8518 or find local support groups Hypermobility Syndromes Association (HMSA) – you can also call their helpline on 0333 011 6388 or find local support groups Information about you If you have EDS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service . This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Page last reviewed: 04 October 2022 Next review due: 04 October 2025"

    "title": "Ejaculation problems",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ejaculation-problems/",
    "text": "Ejaculation problems Ejaculation problems are common sexual problems in men. The 3 main types of ejaculation problems are: premature ejaculation delayed ejaculation retrograde ejaculation If you have a persistent problem with ejaculation, visit your GP, who will discuss the problem with you and may examine you or refer you to a specialist. Premature ejaculation Premature ejaculation is a common ejaculation problem. It's where the male ejaculates sooner than he or his partner wishes during sexual arousal. Occasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and are not a cause for concern. However, if you're finding that it happens more than you'd like, and it's a problem for you, it might help to get treatment. Causes of premature ejaculation Various psychological and physical factors can cause a man to suddenly experience premature ejaculation. Common physical causes include: prostate problems thyroid problems – an overactive thyroid or an underactive thyroid using recreational drugs Common psychological causes may include: depression stress relationship problems anxiety about sexual performance (particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous problems with sexual performance) It's possible for a man to have experienced premature ejaculation since becoming sexually active. A number of possible causes for this are: conditioning – it's possible that early sexual experiences can influence future sexual behaviour. For example, if a teenager conditions himself to ejaculate quickly to avoid being caught masturbating, it may later be difficult to break the habit a previous traumatic sexual experience – this can range from being caught masturbating to sexual abuse a strict upbringing and beliefs about sex Treating premature ejaculation Antidepressants Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant , but they also delay ejaculation. SSRIs used for this purpose include: paroxetine sertraline fluoxetine (Prozac) Another type of antidepressant called clomipramine is also sometimes used. Some men may experience an improvement a few days after treatment begins. However, you'll usually need to take the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks before you notice the full effects. Side effects of SSRIs are usually mild and should improve after 2 to 3 weeks. They include: feeling sick and being sick diarrhoea excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) Read more about the side effects of antidepressants . Dapoxetine (Priligy) An SSRI specifically designed to treat premature ejaculation, known as dapoxetine (Priligy), has been licensed in the UK. Local NHS authorities can choose to prescribe it on the NHS. It acts much faster than the other SSRIs used for premature ejaculation and can be used \"on demand\". You'll usually be advised to take it between 1 and 3 hours before sex, but not more than once a day. Your response to the treatment will then be reviewed after 4 weeks (or after 6 doses), and again every 6 months. Dapoxetine is not suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation. For example, it is not recommended for some men with heart, kidney and liver problems. It can also interact with other medicines, such as other antidepressants. Common side effects include: headaches dizziness feeling sick Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), are a class of medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction. Research has found that they may also help with premature ejaculation. You can get sildenafil on prescription, or buy it from a pharmacy after a discussion with the pharmacist to make sure it's safe for you to take. Read more about sildenafil including information on how and when to take it . Topical anaesthetics and condoms The use of topical anaesthetics such as lidocaine or prilocaine can help but may be transferred and absorbed to the vagina, causing decreased sensation. Condoms can also be used and are effective, particularly when combined with local anaesthesia. Things you can try yourself There are also a number of things you can try yourself. It can sometimes help to: masturbate an hour or 2 before having sex use a thick condom to help decrease sensation have sex with your partner on top (to allow them to pull away when you are close to ejaculating) Psychosexual counselling You may benefit from having psychosexual counselling, where a therapist can help you, and a partner if you have one, with sex related problems. During these sessions, the therapist will: encourage you to explore any relationship issues you may have, and give advice about how to resolve them show you techniques that can help you \"unlearn\" the habit of premature ejaculation (these include the \"squeeze\" and \"stop-go\" techniques) In the squeeze technique, you masturbate but stop before the point of ejaculation and squeeze the head of your penis for between 10 to 20 seconds. Then let go and wait for another 30 seconds before resuming masturbation. This process is carried out several times before ejaculation is allowed to occur. The stop-go technique is similar, but you do not squeeze your penis. Once you feel more confident about delaying ejaculation, you could try this technique during sex, stopping and starting as required. These techniques may sound simple, but they require lots of practice. Delayed ejaculation Delayed ejaculation (male orgasmic disorder) is classed as either: experiencing a significant delay before ejaculation being unable to ejaculate at all, even though the man wants to and his erection is normal You may have delayed ejaculation if you're unable to ejaculate more than half the times you have sex. Causes of delayed ejaculation Like premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation can be caused by psychological and physical factors. Possible psychological causes of delayed ejaculation are similar to those of premature ejaculation – for example, relationship problems, stress or depression. Physical causes of delayed ejaculation include: diabetes spinal cord injuries multiple sclerosis surgery to the bladder or prostate gland increasing age Many medicines are known to cause delayed ejaculation, including: antidepressants , particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medicines to treat high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers antipsychotics, used to treat episodes of psychosis Delayed ejaculation can suddenly start to happen after previously having no problems, or (less commonly) the man may have always experienced it. Treating delayed ejaculation Sex therapy Sex therapy is a form of counselling that uses a combination of psychotherapy and structured changes in your sex life. This can help to increase your feeling of enjoyment during sex and help make ejaculation easier. Some integrated care boards (ICBs) provide a sex therapy service on the NHS. Availability can vary widely depending on where you live. You can also pay privately. The College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists website provides information about private sex therapists and how to find a therapist in your local area . The relationship counselling service Relate also offers sex therapy at a number of its centres . You'll need to pay for each session. During sex therapy, you'll have the opportunity to discuss any emotional or psychological issues related to your sexuality and relationship, in a non-judgemental way. Activities may also be recommended for you to try at home while you're having sex with your partner (you should never be asked to take part in any sexual activities during a session with the therapist). These may include: erotic fantasies and \"sex games\" to make your lovemaking more exciting using sexual aids, such as vibrators, to increase pleasure Read more information about what a sex therapist can do . Switching medicine There are a number of medicines that can be used if it's thought SSRIs are responsible for causing delayed ejaculation. These include: amantadine – originally designed to treat viral infections bupropion – usually prescribed to help people quit smoking yohimbine – originally designed to treat erectile dysfunction These help block some of the chemical effects of SSRIs that may contribute towards delayed ejaculation. Alcohol and drugs Alcohol misuse and recreational drug use can be separate underlying causes of delayed ejaculation, so addressing these problems may help. Read more about getting help with alcohol misuse and drug use . Pseudoephedrine Pseudoephedrine tablets may be tried, but these will need to be prescribed \"off-label\". This means the medicine shows promise in treating delayed ejaculation but it has not been licensed for this particular use (pseudoephedrine is normally used as a decongestant). Retrograde ejaculation Retrograde ejaculation is a rarer type of ejaculation problem. It happens when semen travels backwards into the bladder instead of through the urethra (the tube that urine passes through). The main symptoms of retrograde ejaculation include: producing no semen, or only a small amount, during ejaculation producing cloudy urine (because of the semen in it) when you first go to the toilet after having sex Men with retrograde ejaculation still experience the feeling of an orgasm and the condition does not pose a danger to health. However, it can affect the ability to father a child. Causes of retrograde ejaculation Retrograde ejaculation happens when the neck of the bladder does not close and semen passes into the bladder. Usually when you ejaculate, semen is pushed out of your urethra. It is prevented from entering your bladder by the muscles around the neck of the bladder, which close tightly at the moment of orgasm. However, damage to the surrounding muscles or nerves can stop the bladder neck closing, causing the semen to move into the bladder rather than up through the urethra. Causes of retrograde ejaculation include prostate gland surgery , bladder surgery, diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and a class of medicines known as alpha blockers, which are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Treating retrograde ejaculation Most men do not need treatment for retrograde ejaculation because they are still able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the condition does not have adverse effects on their health. But if treatment is required (usually because of wanting to father a child), there are options to try. For example, pseudoephedrine (commonly used as a decongestant) has proved effective in treating retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery. If retrograde ejaculation is caused by using a certain medicine, then normal ejaculation will usually return once medicine is stopped. Speak to your GP before stopping any prescribed medicine. However, if the retrograde ejaculation has been caused by significant muscle or nerve damage, treatment may not be possible. Men who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine or testicles for use in intrauterine insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) . Involve your partner If you're having problems with your sex life and are seeking treatment, it is usually recommended you involve your partner as much as possible. Communicating your concerns can often go a long way to helping to resolve them. And, in some cases, your partner may also have their own problems that are contributing towards problems with your sex life. For example, some women are unable to reach climax during \"normal\" intercourse and require manual or oral stimulation. Blood in your semen Finding blood in your semen can be alarming. However, in most cases it's not serious and will pass within a few days. It can be caused by an infection of your urethra ( urethritis ) or prostate ( prostatitis ). See your GP if you have blood in your semen. They can check if you need further tests or treatment. Read more about blood in the semen .

    "title": "Empyema",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/empyema/",
    "text": "Empyema Empyema is the medical term for pockets of pus that have collected inside a body cavity. They can form if a bacterial infection is left untreated, or if it fails to fully respond to treatment. The term empyema is most commonly used to refer to pus-filled pockets that develop in the pleural space. This is the slim space between the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest cavity. Empyema is a serious condition that requires treatment. It can cause fever, chest pains, breathlessness and coughing up mucus. Although it can occasionally be life threatening, it's not a common condition, as most bacterial infections are effectively treated with antibiotics before they get to this stage. What causes empyema? The lungs and inside of the chest cavity are lined with a smooth layer called the pleura. These layers are almost in contact, but separated by a thin space (the pleural space) filled with a small amount of lubricant called pleural fluid. The pleural fluid can sometimes build up and become infected, and a collection of pus forms. This can thicken and cause areas of the pleura to stick together, creating pockets of pus. Empyema can worsen to become many more pockets of pus, with thick deposits coating the outer layer of the lungs. These deposits prevent the lungs expanding properly. Pneumonia and other possible causes The most common cause of empyema is pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection of the lungs. An empyema can form when pneumonia fails to fully respond to treatment in a straightforward way. Other possible causes are: bronchiectasis – a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection a blood clot or another blockage – this can prevent blood flow to the lungs, causing some of the lung tissue to die (known as a pulmonary infarction) surgery to the chest – empyema is a rare complication an endoscopy – empyema is a rare complication serious injury to the chest an infection elsewhere in the body that's spread through the bloodstream an infection caused by inhaled food if you have swallowing problems – this is rare tuberculosis – this is rare in the UK You're more at risk of developing an empyema if you: have diabetes have a weakened immune system have acid reflux drink too much alcohol or take a lot of recreational drugs Both adults and children can be affected. What are the symptoms? An empyema can be distressing and uncomfortable. It can cause: a fever and night sweats a lack of energy difficulty breathing weight loss chest pain a cough and coughing up mucus containing pus How is it diagnosed? An empyema is usually suspected when a person with severe pneumonia doesn't improve with treatment and they start to show some of the symptoms of empyema . If the patient is coughing up mucus, a sample of this should be taken to be inspected under a microscope. The type of bacteria causing the infection is identified so the most effective antibiotics can be given. A blood sample will also be taken to count the number of white blood cells and other markers of infection. An X-ray or ultrasound scan will show whether there's a collection of fluid building up around the lungs and how much there is. If there is fluid a sample will be taken and sent for analysis. Often a CT scan may also be used to give a more detailed assessment. How is it treated? Antibiotics Some patients will just need antibiotics given directly into a vein through a drip (intravenously). But they may need to stay in hospital for a long period. Chest drain Some patients may need both antibiotics and a chest drain. A chest drain is a flexible plastic tube that's inserted through the chest wall and into the affected area to drain it of fluid. The area where the tube is inserted is numbed, and the patient may also be given a light sedative before having the drain inserted. Painkillers are given to ease any pain while the chest drain is in. The chest tube usually stays in place until an X-ray or ultrasound scan shows all the fluid has drained from the chest and the lungs are fully expanded. Sometimes injections may be given through the chest drain to help clear the infected pockets of pus. The patient may need to stay in hospital until the tube is removed. Some patients may be able to go home with the chest tube still in place, in which case a specialist nurse will offer support and advice on how to manage this at home. The nurse will demonstrate how to position, empty and change the bag until the family or patient feels confident they can do this themselves. Find out more about chest drains from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust Surgery to remove the lung lining Surgery may be needed if the condition doesn't improve. This involves making a cut in the chest to access the lungs and removing the thick layer coating the lungs so they can expand properly again. This is only carried out if other treatments haven't worked. Your surgeon or specialist will explain the benefits and risks of the procedure. Find out more about lung surgery Stoma A chest drain isn't suitable for all patients. Some will instead opt to have an opening made in their chest, known as a stoma. A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect the fluid that leaks from the empyema. This is worn on the body, and may be more discreet and interfere less with your lifestyle than a chest drain. But with modern treatments, getting a stoma is uncommon. Page last reviewed: 12 January 2022 Next review due: 12 January 2025"

    "title": "Overview-Encephalitis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/encephalitis/",
    "text": "Overview - Encephalitis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition in which the brain becomes inflamed (swollen). It can be life threatening and requires urgent treatment in hospital. Anyone can be affected, but the very young and very old are most at risk. Symptoms of encephalitis Encephalitis usually starts off with flu-like symptoms , such as a high temperature and headache . More serious symptoms come on over hours, days or weeks, including: confusion or disorientation seizures or fits changes in personality and behaviour difficulty speaking weakness or loss of movement in some parts of the body loss of consciousness Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has these serious symptoms. Causes of encephalitis It's not always clear what causes encephalitis, but it can be caused by: viral infections – very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by the common viruses that causes cold sores (herpes simplex) or chickenpox (herpes varicella) spreading to the brain a problem with the immune system, the body's defence against infection – sometimes something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks the brain, causing it to become inflamed bacterial or fungal infections – these are much rarer causes of encephalitis than viral infections Some types of encephalitis are spread by mosquitoes (such as Japanese encephalitis ), ticks (such as tick-borne encephalitis ) and mammals (such as rabies ). You cannot catch encephalitis from someone else. Treatments for encephalitis Encephalitis needs to be treated in a hospital. The earlier treatment is started, the more successful it's likely to be. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include: antiviral medicines steroid injections treatments to help control the immune system antibiotics or antifungal medicines painkillers to reduce discomfort or a high temperature medicine to control seizures or fits support with breathing, such as oxygen through a face mask or a breathing machine (ventilator) How long someone with encephalitis needs to stay in hospital can range from a few days to several weeks or even months. Recovering from encephalitis Some people eventually make a full recovery from encephalitis, although this can be a long and frustrating process. Many people never make a full recovery and are left with long-term problems caused by damage to their brain. Common complications include: memory loss (amnesia) frequent seizures or fits personality and behavioural changes problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving persistent tiredness These problems can have a significant impact on the life of the affected person, as well as their family and friends. But help and support is available. Preventing encephalitis It's not always possible to prevent encephalitis, but some of the infections that cause it can be prevented with vaccinations. These include the: measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine – a routine vaccination offered to all children in England Japanese encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to at-risk areas, such as parts of Asia tick-borne encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to certain parts of Europe (but not the UK) and Asia rabies vaccination – recommended for travellers to at-risk where access to medical care is likely to be limited. Find out about rabies risks in terrestrial animals by country on GOV.UK . Speak to a GP surgery if you're not sure whether your vaccinations are up to date, or you're planning to travel abroad and do not know if you need any vaccinations.

    "text": "Overview - Endocarditis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Endocarditis is a rare and potentially fatal infection of the inner lining of the heart (the endocardium). It's most commonly caused by bacteria entering the blood and travelling to the heart. Although the heart is usually well protected against infection, it may be easier for bacteria to bypass the immune system in people who have: an artificial (prosthetic) heart valve – valve replacement surgery is increasingly being used when people experience narrowing of one of their heart valves congenital heart disease – where a person is born with heart defects hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – where the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken damaged heart valves – because of infection or heart disease had endocarditis before People who inject drugs are also more likely to develop endocarditis. Find out more about the causes of endocarditis Symptoms of endocarditis The initial symptoms of endocarditis are similar to flu and include: a high temperature chills headache joint and muscle pain Without treatment, the infection damages the heart valves and disrupts the normal flow of blood through the heart. This could trigger a range of life-threatening complications, such as: heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body to properly meet the body's demands stroke – where the supply of blood to the brain becomes disrupted Find out more about the symptoms of endocarditis Treating endocarditis Endocarditis is treated with a course of antibiotics given via a drip. You'll need to be admitted to hospital for this. Some people also need surgery to repair or replace a damaged heart valve or drain any abscesses that develop. Endocarditis is a serious illness, especially if complications develop. Early diagnosis and treatment is vital to improve the outlook for the condition. Find out more about the treatment of endocarditis Who's affected Endocarditis is a rare condition in England, even in those with a higher risk. It's more common in older people. But cases of endocarditis have been recorded in children, particularly those born with congenital heart disease. Twice as many men are affected as women. Although it may sound strange, rates of endocarditis are increasing because of advances in medical care. This is because there's an increasing number of people being treated with valve replacement surgery or surgery to repair congenital heart disease.

    "text": "Enlarged prostate An enlarged prostate (sometimes called benign prostate enlargement) is when your prostate gets bigger. It's common and is not usually serious, but there are treatments that can help if you need them. An enlarged prostate is most common in men over 50 years old. It can affect anyone with a prostate. What the prostate is The prostate is a small gland below the bladder that makes semen and controls the flow of pee from your bladder to your penis. If it gets bigger (enlarged) it can put pressure on the tube that carries pee from your bladder (urethra), causing problems with peeing. Credit: Multimedia Team - nhs.uk Symptoms of an enlarged prostate The main symptoms of an enlarged prostate are problems with peeing, such as: difficulty starting to pee, or having to push or strain to pee a weak flow of pee, stopping and starting, and taking longer than usual to empty your bladder feeling like you cannot fully empty your bladder dribbling pee after you finish peeing needing to pee more often or urgently, including getting up to pee during the night The symptoms usually develop slowly, and may gradually get worse as you get older. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have difficulty peeing or need to pee more frequently Try not to be embarrassed. The GP will be used to talking about these symptoms. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have blood in your pee – your pee may look pink, red or brown you have pain when peeing you cannot pee at all You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Important It's important to get these symptoms checked by a GP because they can sometimes be caused by other more serious conditions, such as prostate cancer . If they're caused by cancer, finding it early may mean it's easier to treat. How an enlarged prostate is diagnosed If a GP thinks you could have an enlarged prostate they'll ask about your symptoms, such as how often you pee. They may ask to examine your tummy (abdomen) and penis, and feel inside your bottom with their finger to check the size of your prostate ( rectal examination ). They'll usually ask you to keep a record for at least 3 days of how much you drink, and how often and how much you pee. Tests the GP might do include: testing a sample of your pee a blood test called a PSA test They may refer you to a specialist in hospital for more tests, such as: a urine flow test, where you pee into a machine that measures how you pee an ultrasound scan of your bladder a procedure to look inside your bladder with a camera ( cystoscopy ) Treatment for an enlarged prostate An enlarged prostate does not always need treatment. It depends on your symptoms and how they're affecting you. If your symptoms are not causing many problems, doctors will usually recommend trying lifestyle changes first. If your symptoms get worse you may need medicines or surgery. Medicines for an enlarged prostate If you have moderate or severe symptoms you may be offered medicines for an enlarged prostate, including: medicines that help you to pee, such as tamsulosin , doxazosin or alfuzosin medicines that help with needing to pee more often or more urgently, such as oxybutynin or tolterodine medicines that help stop your prostate growing, by reducing hormone levels, if you're at high risk of your condition getting worse, such as finasteride or dutasteride These medicines can cause side effects. Your doctor will explain the benefits and possible side effects and help you decide if they are right for you. You'll have regular check-ups to see how well the medicine is working. Surgery for an enlarged prostate You might be offered surgery if medicines have not helped, or your symptoms are severe. The most common surgery you may be offered for an enlarged prostate is called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) . This involves removing part of your prostate through a thin tube that's passed up your penis to your prostate. Sometimes you may be offered a different procedure, but they may not be suitable for everyone. They include: removing or destroying part of your prostate using lasers, an electrical current, steam or a jet of water holding part of your prostate open and widening your urethra, using a small implant making small cuts in your prostate around the opening to the bladder removing part of your prostate using surgery The surgeon will explain your options, the risks and benefits of the procedure, and what will happen.

    "text": "Overview - Epidermolysis bullosa Contents Overview Symptoms Treatment Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is the name for a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile. Any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters. Symptoms of epidermolysis bullosa Common symptoms in all types of EB include: skin that blisters easily blisters on the hands and soles of the feet thickened skin that may be scarred or change colour over time thickening of the skin and nails Credit: SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/151100/view Credit: SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/877183/view Types of epidermolysis bullosa The 3 main types of EB are: epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) – the most common type, which can range from mild, with a low risk of serious complications, to severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) – which can range from mild to severe junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) – a rare form of EB that ranges from moderate to severe The type reflects where on the body the blistering takes place and which layer of skin is affected. There are also many variants of these 3 main types of EB, each with slightly different symptoms. Read more about symptoms of different types of epidermolysis bullosa . Diagnosing EB EB is usually diagnosed in babies and young children, as the symptoms can be obvious from birth. But some milder types of EB may not be diagnosed until adulthood. If it's suspected your child has the condition, they'll be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). The specialist will carry out tests to determine the type of EB and help come up with a treatment plan. They may take a small sample of skin (biopsy) to send for testing. Prenatal testing In some cases it's possible to test an unborn baby for EB after the 11th week of pregnancy. Prenatal tests include amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling . This may be offered if you or your partner are known to be a carrier of the faulty gene associated with EB and there's a risk of having a child with a severe type of EB. If the test confirms your child will have EB, you'll be offered counselling and advice. Causes of epidermolysis bullosa EB is caused by a faulty gene (gene mutation) that makes skin more fragile. A child with EB might have inherited the faulty gene from a parent who also has EB. Or they might have inherited the faulty gene from both parents who are just \"carriers\" but don't have EB themselves. The change to the gene can also happen by chance, when neither parent are carriers. Treatment for epidermolysis bullosa There's currently no cure for EB, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications developing, such as infection. A team of medical specialists will help you decide what treatment is best for your child and offer advice about living with the condition. Managing EB can include: popping blisters with a sterile needle applying protective dressings avoiding things that make the condition worse A gel containing birch bark extract can be used to treat DEB and JEB in people aged 6 months and over. Medicines can be used to treat infection or to reduce pain. Surgery may be needed if EB causes narrowing of the food pipe or problems with the hands. Read more about treating epidermolysis bullosa . Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an acquired form of EB with similar symptoms. Like EB, EBA causes the skin to blister easily. It can also affect the mouth, throat and digestive tract. But EBA isn't inherited, and symptoms don't usually appear until later life. It's an autoimmune disease, which means your immune system starts to attack healthy body tissue. It's not known exactly what causes this. EBA is a very rare condition that tends to affect people over the age of 40. Charities and support groups If your child is diagnosed with EB, it can be a frightening and overwhelming experience. You'll probably want to find out as much as possible about the condition and available treatments. DEBRA is a national charity that provides help, advice and support for people in the UK living with or directly affected by EB. DEBRA International is a worldwide network of national groups working on behalf of people affected by EB. Cure EB is a charity that funds research into treatments and a cure for Epidermolysis Bullosa. Support for carers It's important not to neglect your own health and wellbeing when caring for a child with a complex and demanding condition such as EB. Read about carers' breaks and respite care and caring for a disabled child . Information about you If you or your child has EB, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Epididymitis Epididymitis is where a tube (the epididymis) behind the testicles becomes swollen and painful. It's often caused by an infection and is usually treated with antibiotics. Symptoms of epididymitis Symptoms of epididymitis may include: sudden or gradual pain in 1 or both of your testicles (balls) the bag of skin containing your testicles (scrotum) feeling tender, warm and swollen a build-up of fluid around your testicle (a hydrocele) that feels like a lump or swelling Depending on the cause, you may have other symptoms, such as difficulty peeing, or a white, yellow or green discharge from the tip of the penis. Causes of epididymitis Epididymitis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) , such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea . This is more likely in younger men under 35 years old. In men over 35, the main cause is usually a urine infection. If testing shows that your epididymitis is caused by a STI, it may be recommended that your current or recent sexual partners (over the past 6 months) are also tested for STIs. It can also be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) , but UTIs are less common in men. A UTI is more likely if you have: an enlarged prostate gland a urinary catheter recently had surgery to the groin, prostate gland or bladder Less common causes of epididymitis include: mumps tuberculosis taking amiodarone, a medicine used to treat heart rhythm disorder a groin injury Behçet's disease Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have a lump in your testicles you have swollen testicles there's a change in the shape of your testicles you notice a change in the way your testicles feel 1 testicle becomes bigger than the other you get aching or discomfort in your testicles that does not go away Lumps in the testicles can be a sign of testicular cancer. This is easier to treat if it's found early. Information: Sexual health clinics can help with epididymitis You can also get treatment for epididymitis at a sexual health clinic. They can provide the same antibiotics you'd get at your GP surgery. Many sexual health clinics also offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment. Find a sexual health clinic Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you get sudden, unbearable pain in your testicles or tummy This could be caused by your testicle becoming twisted and needs to be treated in hospital as soon as possible. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. What happens at your appointment If you go to a GP or sexual health clinic with symptoms of epididymitis, you'll usually need some tests first to find out the cause. These may include: a groin examination a swab of the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra) – to test for infection urine and blood tests a rectal examination – to check for problems with your prostate Treatments for epididymitis The treatment for epididymitis is usually antibiotics. They're given as injections or taken as tablets, or a combination of both. It's important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better. You should start to feel better within a few days, but it may take up to 3 months to fully recover. If you still have symptoms after this, you might be referred for further tests. Things you can do to help with epididymitis If you're recovering from epididymitis, there are things you can do to help ease pain and swelling and prevent any further problems. Do take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help with the pain – if you have a history of seizures or fits, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen should not be taken with some antibiotics used to treat epididymitis; speak to a pharmacist about the best painkiller to use if you're unsure hold a cold pack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) on your groin wear underwear that supports your scrotum Don’t do not have sex if you have gonorrhoea or chlamydia until you have finished the full course of treatment, or for 7 days after Page last reviewed: 06 August 2024 Next review due: 06 August 2027"

Epiglottitis can block your windpipe, even when you're not swallowing, making it difficult to breathe. It's a medical emergency and needs to be treated in hospital straight away. Symptoms of epiglottitis The main symptom of epiglottitis is finding it very difficult to breathe. It usually comes on quickly. Your breathing may: be very fast or slow be easier when you lean forward make a high-pitched, rasping sound as you breathe in If a child has epiglottitis, they may not want to lie down, and will lean forward with their neck pushed out while they're sitting. You or your child may also have other symptoms, including: a very sore throat a high temperature a hoarse (croaky) voice finding it painful and difficult to swallow drooling pale, grey or blue-tinged skin ( cyanosis ) – this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, lips, gums and inside the eyelids on brown or black skin being extremely tired or very restless and irritable Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you think you or your child may have epiglottitis Stay upright until help arrives as lying down can make symptoms worse. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Treatment for epiglottitis If you have epiglottitis, you will need treatment in hospital. You'll usually need oxygen through a tube in your nose or a face mask. You may also need to have a breathing tube either put down your throat or into a hole made in your neck ( tracheostomy ) if you're finding it very difficult to breathe. You'll also be given antibiotics through a vein if an infection has caused your symptoms. You may have tests to check how swollen your windpipe is and find out what has caused your symptoms. These can include: a laryngoscopy, where a tube with a camera at the end is used to look at your throat a throat swab, where a swab (like a big cotton bud) is used to collect a sample of cells from your throat for testing blood tests an X-ray or CT scan With treatment, most people will make a full recovery, but you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. Causes of epiglottitis Epiglottitis is usually caused by a type of bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) . Hib is spread through coughing and sneezing, or touching objects and surfaces that have the virus on them. Other causes of epiglottitis include: injuring your throat, such as being hit in your throat or drinking very hot liquids smoking, especially illegal drugs like cannabis or crack cocaine You may also have a higher chance of getting epiglottitis if you have a weakened immune system. Preventing epiglottitis The most common cause of epiglottitis is Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) . Vaccines that protect against Hib are offered to babies as part of the NHS vaccination schedule . There are 2 vaccines that protect against Hib: 6-in-1 vaccine – given in 3 doses at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old Hib/Men C vaccine – a booster vaccine given at 1 year old If you or your child were not vaccinated as a baby, you can ask a GP about how to get vaccinated.

    "text": "Epilepsy Epilepsy is a condition that affects your brain and causes seizures (sometimes called fits). It cannot currently be cured, but treatment can often help manage it. Symptoms of epilepsy Usually the only symptom of epilepsy is having seizures. Symptoms of seizures can include: your body becoming stiff or floppy suddenly falling to the floor jerking or twitching movements in your body peeing unintentionally losing awareness of what's around you – you may stare into space and not be able to respond normally unusual feelings or sensations, such as strange smells, numbness or tingling, changes in your vision, or suddenly feeling scared unusual behaviour, such as fidgeting or walking around and not being aware of what you're doing A seizure usually lasts a few seconds or minutes, and stops by itself. You might be aware of having a seizure and remember it afterwards, or you might not. Symptoms of epilepsy often start in young children and people over 50, but it can happen at any age. Epileptic seizures are different from febrile seizures , which can happen in children when they have a high temperature. Information: Find out what to do if someone has a seizure Immediate action required: Call 999 if: You think someone's having a seizure and: it's the first time it's happened it lasts longer than is usual for them, or longer than 5 minutes if you do not know how long their seizures usually last they do not recover as usual afterwards, or they have another seizure without recovering between seizures they've now had 3 or more seizures in 24 hours Information: People with epilepsy do not always need to go to hospital when they have a seizure. They usually have a care plan that says what to do, such as giving emergency medicine and when to call 999. If you know what to do and have been trained then you can follow their care plan. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you think you or your child may have had a seizure for the first time and you did not go to hospital you've had a seizure after having no seizures for a long time You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Call 111 if you need advice for a child under 5 years old. How epilepsy is diagnosed If you or your child have had a seizure you'll need to see a specialist doctor. They'll check what caused it and whether you might have epilepsy. They'll ask about what happened before, during and after the seizure. If someone else saw the seizure, it can help to bring them with you to your appointment. Tests you might have include: an electroencephalogram (EEG) to check electrical activity in your brain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check your heart scans such as an MRI scan or CT scan blood tests genetic testing Having a seizure does not always mean you have epilepsy, as seizures can have other causes. You'll usually be diagnosed with epilepsy if you've had more than 1 seizure, or if tests show you're at risk of having more seizures. Types of epileptic seizure There are different types of epileptic seizure. They can affect people differently. You may have only one type of seizure, or more than one. Your specialist may need to monitor your symptoms and tests results to tell you which type you have. The main types of epileptic seizure are: tonic clonic seizures, where you become unconscious and may fall, your muscles get stiff and your body jerks and shakes tonic seizures, where your muscles suddenly get stiff and you may fall, then recover quickly atonic seizures, where your muscles suddenly go floppy and you may fall, then recover quickly absence seizures, where you briefly lose awareness of what's going on around you focal seizures, where you have unusual feelings, sensations or movements myoclonic seizures, where your muscles briefly jerk Information: Find out more Epilepsy Society: epileptic seizures Treatment for epilepsy If you have epilepsy you'll be supported by your GP and a team of specialists. You'll have check-ups at least once a year. Your team will work with you to agree a care plan that includes details of the care and support you need. The care plan will tell your family or carers what to do when you have a seizure. Medicines for epilepsy The main treatment for epilepsy is medicine to prevent seizures, called anti-epileptic or anti-seizure medicine. You may also be given medicine to use as emergency treatment if you have a seizure that lasts longer than usual. A family member or carer will need to give this to you. There are different anti-epileptic medicines. The medicine recommended for you depends on the type of seizures and things like your age, sex and any other conditions you have. You may need to try different medicines to find what works for you. If you have not had a seizure for 2 years, your specialist may suggest you try stopping your treatment by gradually reducing the dose. Do not change your dose or stop taking your medicine without talking to your specialist. If you take medicines for epilepsy you're entitled to free prescriptions for all your medicines. Important: Epilepsy medicines and pregnancy Some types of epilepsy medicine can harm your baby if you take them in pregnancy, or if you or your partner is taking them when you get pregnant. If you or your partner are taking epilepsy medicine and there's a chance you could get pregnant it's very important to discuss your treatment with a specialist. You may need to use contraception, or you may need to switch to another medicine. Other treatments For most people medicines work well to prevent seizures. Rarely, you may need other treatments. These can include: surgery on your brain putting a small electrical device under the skin on your chest to help reduce seizures (vagus nerve stimulation) a specialist diet that can reduce seizures (ketogenic diet) Information: Find out more Epilepsy Society: epilepsy treatment NHS medicines A to Z: find your medicine Things you can do to help with epilepsy If you have epilepsy there are things you can do to keep yourself safe and reduce the risk of seizures, if they're not completely controlled by your medicine. Do make sure your family and friends know what to do if you have a seizure carry medical ID, such as a bracelet or a card that lets people know you have epilepsy keep a diary to help you identify things that might trigger a seizure, such as tiredness, stress, your period, flashing lights, food or drink make your home safer – for example you can fit carpets and radiator covers consider using an alarm to get help if you have a seizure have showers instead of baths if you can think about safety when doing activities such as cooking, using tools or machinery, swimming or sports Don’t do not miss doses of your epilepsy medicine do not change your epilepsy treatment without getting advice from your GP or specialist do not drink too much alcohol, as it can increase the risk of seizures Important: Epilepsy and driving If you've had any type of seizure you must not drive, and you must tell the DVLA. When you can start driving again depends on the type of seizure and when it last happened. You'll need to follow the DVLA's rules about epilepsy and driving . Information: Find out more Epilepsy Action: living with epilepsy Epilepsy Society: safety and risk How epilepsy affects your life Epilepsy affects everyone differently. It can be a life-long condition, or it can get better. How it affects you depends on the type of seizures you have, how often they happen and how well your treatment works. For most people, medicine works well to prevent or reduce seizures, and epilepsy has a small impact on their daily life. But some people have seizures that are harder to control, and need more support. Seizures are not usually harmful, although they can cause accidents or injuries. The risk of seizures may affect the type of work or activities you can do, and you may need to take extra safety measures. Risks of epilepsy An epileptic seizure usually stops by itself and does not cause any lasting problems. Rarely, a seizure can last a long time, or you may have several seizures without recovering in between. This is called status epilepticus, and needs urgent treatment to prevent damage to your brain. There's also a small risk of dying suddenly, called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). But this is rare, and epilepsy treatment can reduce the risk. Epilepsy and pregnancy You can have a healthy pregnancy if you have epilepsy. But there's a chance you'll have more seizures in pregnancy. You may need extra appointments and tests. You might also need to change your medicine as some epilepsy medicines are not safe to take in pregnancy. If your partner takes epilepsy medicine, they may need to change their medicine. This is because some epilepsy medicines can affect sperm, which could harm your baby if you get pregnant. If you're planning to get pregnant or you find out you're pregnant, keep taking your medicine but speak to your specialist team straight away to review your treatment. Information: Find out more Epilepsy Action: epilepsy-related deaths and SUDEP SUDEP Action: information and support for people affected by SUDEP Epilepsy and pregnancy Causes of epilepsy Epilepsy happens when the normal electrical activity in your brain changes. It's thought that epilepsy is often related to the genes you inherit from your parents, or to changes in your genes. It's sometimes caused by damage to your brain, for example after a head injury, a stroke or an infection. But for many people it's not clear what causes it. Help and support for epilepsy As well as support from your healthcare team, you may find it helpful to get support from other people with epilepsy, either at a local support group or online. There are also national charities that can offer support and information about epilepsy. Epilepsy Action Information and support for anyone affected by epilepsy.

    "text": "Erectile dysfunction (impotence) Erectile dysfunction (impotence) is very common, particularly in men over 40. It's usually nothing to worry about, but see a GP if it keeps happening. What is erectile dysfunction? Erectile dysfunction is when you are either: unable to get an erection unable to keep an erection for long enough to have sex Depending on the cause, you may still be able to get an erection at other times, such as when you wake up. Sometimes you might also have low sex drive (loss of libido) . Causes of erectile dysfunction Most men occasionally fail to get or keep an erection. This is usually caused by stress, tiredness or drinking too much alcohol, and it's nothing to worry about. It can also be a side effect of some medicines. If erectile dysfunction happens often, it may be caused by a condition such as: high blood pressure or high cholesterol diabetes depression or anxiety hormone problems Things you can do to help with erectile dysfunction Healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help with erectile dysfunction. Do lose weight if you're overweight stop smoking eat a healthy diet exercise daily try to reduce stress and anxiety Don’t do not drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week do not cycle for a while, if you cycle for more than 3 hours a week Non-urgent advice: See a GP or go to a sexual health clinic if: erection problems keep happening It might be a sign of a health condition that can be treated. Information: How sexual health clinics can help with erection problems Sexual health clinics treat problems with sexual health. They can provide the same treatment you would get at your GP surgery. Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment. They'll often get test results quicker than GP practices. Find a sexual health clinic near you What happens at your appointment If you see someone about erectile dysfunction, the doctor or nurse may: ask about your lifestyle and relationships, and any problems you might be having do some basic health checks, such as taking your blood pressure examine your genitals to rule out any obvious physical cause If you have symptoms like needing to pee more often than usual, you may also have an examination of your prostate ( rectal examination ). Treatments for erectile dysfunction Treatment can usually help improve erectile dysfunction. Medicines for erectile dysfunction The main treatments are medicines that increase the blood flow to your penis, called PDE-5 inhibitors. These include: sildenafil (Viagra) tadalafil (Cialis) vardenafil (Levitra) avanafil (Spedra) You can get sildenafil on prescription or you can buy it from a pharmacy. You need a prescription for the other types. Buying Viagra online You can buy sildenafil (Viagra) over the internet. Be very careful if you do this as many websites sell fake medicines. Online medicines are not always regulated and the ingredients in them can vary from one pack to another. They can cause unpleasant side effects, or may not be suitable for you. It's best to see a doctor before buying medicines online. They know your medical history and can discuss whether you might benefit from treatment. If you choose to buy sildenafil (Viagra) on the internet, make sure: any online pharmacy is registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) any online doctor service is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) all doctors are registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) Vacuum pumps Vacuum pumps encourage blood to flow to the penis, causing an erection. They work for most men and can be used if medicine is not suitable or does not work. They're not always available on the NHS. Speak to a doctor about where to get a vacuum pump. Treating the cause of erectile dysfunction There are also treatments for some of the causes of erectile dysfunction. For example: your doctor may switch you to a different medicine if it's causing your erectile dysfunction high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hormone problems may be treated with medicine counselling and therapy can help if your erection problems are linked to emotional or mental health problems – but there can be a long wait for these services on the NHS Information: Finding private counsellors or sex therapists You can also pay to see a counsellor or therapist privately. Counsellors and psychotherapists should be a member of the: British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy Sex therapists should be a member of the: College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT) Institute of Psychosexual Medicine Relate also offers sex therapy for a fee.

    "title": "Erythrocytosis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/erythrocytosis/",
    "text": "Erythrocytosis Erythrocytosis, sometimes called polycythaemia, means having a high concentration of red blood cells in your blood. This makes the blood thicker and less able to travel through blood vessels and organs. Many of the symptoms of erythrocytosis are caused by this sluggish flow of blood. Symptoms of erythrocytosis Not everyone with erythrocytosis has symptoms – but many do. Make an appointment to see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of erythrocytosis. These include: headaches blurred vision red skin, particularly in the face, hands and feet – this may be more difficult to see on black or brown skin tiredness high blood pressure dizziness discomfort in the tummy confusion bleeding problems – such as nosebleeds and bruising gout – which can cause joint pain, stiffness and swelling itchy skin – especially after a bath or shower When to seek immediate medical advice Erythrocytosis can cause blood clots . These put you at risk of life-threatening problems such as: pulmonary embolisms – a blockage in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – a blockage that forms in the blood vessels in your leg before moving elsewhere in your body Seek medical help immediately if you or someone you're with shows signs of DVT or a pulmonary embolism. These include: pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one of your legs a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot breathlessness chest or upper back pain coughing up blood feeling lightheaded or dizzy fainting Erythrocytosis also increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. Seek emergency medical help if you think that you or someone you're with is having a heart attack or stroke . What causes erythrocytosis? Erythrocytosis can be divided into several different types, depending on the underlying cause. In some cases, an underlying cause can't be identified. Apparent erythrocytosis \"Apparent erythrocytosis\" is where your red cell count is normal, but you have a reduced amount of a fluid called plasma in your blood, making it thicker. Apparent erythrocytosis is often caused by being overweight, smoking, drinking too much alcohol or taking certain medicines – including diuretics (tablets for high blood pressure that make you pee more). Apparent erythrocytosis may improve if the underlying cause is identified and managed. Stopping smoking or reducing your alcohol intake, for example, may help. Relative polycythaemia This is similar to apparent erythrocytosis. It can happen as a result of dehydration. Absolute polycythaemia \"Absolute erythrocytosis\" is where your body produces too many red blood cells. There are 2 main types: primary erythrocytosis – there's a problem in the cells produced by the bone marrow that become red blood cells; the most common type is known as polycythaemia vera secondary erythrocytosis – too many red blood cells are produced as the result of an underlying condition Primary erythrocytosis - polycythaemia vera Polycythaemia vera is rare. It's usually caused by a change in the JAK2 gene, which causes the bone marrow cells to produce too many red blood cells. It’s a slow-growing type of blood cancer. The affected bone marrow cells can also develop into other cells found in the blood, which means that people with polycythaemia vera may also have abnormally high numbers of both platelets and white bloods cells. Although caused by a genetic change, polycythaemia vera isn't usually inherited. Most cases develop later in life. The average age at diagnosis is 60. Secondary erythrocytosis Secondary erythrocytosis is where an underlying condition causes more erythropoietin to be produced. This is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the bone marrow cells to produce red blood cells. Health conditions that can cause secondary erythrocytosis include: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – this can cause an increase in erythropoietin, due to not enough oxygen reaching the body's tissues a problem with the kidneys – such as a kidney cancer or narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys How erythrocytosis is diagnosed Erythrocytosis can be diagnosed by carrying out a blood test to check: the number of red blood cells in your blood ( red blood cell count ) the amount of space the red blood cells take up in the blood (haematocrit level) A high concentration of red blood cells suggests you have erythrocytosis. Erythrocytosis is sometimes only discovered during a routine blood test for another reason. Your GP may refer you to a haematologist (a specialist in blood disorders) for more tests, to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the underlying cause. These may include: a blood test to look for the changed JAK2 gene an ultrasound scan of your tummy to look for problems in your kidneys Treatments for erythrocytosis Treatment for erythrocytosis aims to prevent symptoms and complications (such as blood clots), and treat any underlying causes. Venesection (removing blood) Venesection is the simplest and quickest way of reducing the number of red cells in your blood. It may be recommended if you have polycythaemia vera, a history of blood clots, or symptoms suggesting your blood is too thick. Venesection involves removing about 1 pint (half a litre) of blood at a time, in a similar way to the procedure used for blood donation . How often this is needed will be different for each person. At first, you may need the treatment every week, but once your erythrocytosis is under control you should need it less often. If you are going to have a venesection, your hospital will give you more information about what is involved. Medicine to reduce red blood cells In cases of polycythaemia vera, medicine may be prescribed to slow down the production of red blood cells. Many different medicines are available and your specialist will take into account your age and health, response to venesection and red blood cell count when choosing the most appropriate one for you. Examples include: hydroxycarbamide – this medicine is taken as tablets every morning and is generally tolerated well. But you should not take it if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant interferon – this medicine is given by injection into the abdomen or thigh 1 to 3 times a week. You can inject it yourself at home once you've become familiar with how to do it. Interferon has the advantage that it can be taken in pregnancy, but it may cause unpleasant side effects, such as hair loss and flu -like symptoms Medicine to prevent blood clots If you have polycythaemia vera, daily low-dose aspirin tablets may be prescribed to help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of serious complications. You may also be offered treatment with low-dose aspirin if you have apparent or secondary erythrocytosis and another health problem affecting your blood vessels, such as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease . Treating and preventing other symptoms Some people may also need treatment for any other symptoms or complications of erythrocytosis they have, or for any underlying cause of the condition. For example, you may be given medicine to help relieve itching or manage COPD. Read more about: treatments for itching treating COPD Lifestyle changes that help As well as improving some cases of apparent erythrocytosis, making healthy lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of potentially serious blood clots for people with all types of erythrocytosis. Having erythrocytosis means you're already at high risk of a blood clot, and being overweight or smoking only increases this risk. You may find the following advice and information helpful: Better health - lose weight BMI healthy weight calculator preventing cardiovascular disease managing high blood pressure stopping smoking Outlook for erythrocytosis The outlook for erythrocytosis largely depends on the underlying cause. Many cases are mild and may not lead to any further complications. However, some cases – particularly cases of polycythaemia vera – can be more serious and require long-term treatment. If well controlled, erythrocytosis should not affect your life expectancy, and you should be able to live a normal life. However, people with polycythaemia vera can have a slightly lower life expectancy than normal due to the increased risk of problems, such as heart attacks and strokes. Polycythaemia vera can also sometimes cause scarring of the bone marrow (myelofibrosis), which can eventually lead to you having too few blood cells. In some rare cases, it can develop into a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) . Page last reviewed: 17 March 2023 Next review due: 17 March 2026"

    "text": "Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) Excessive sweating is common and can affect the whole body or just certain areas. Sometimes it gets better with age but there are things you can do and treatments that can help. What is excessive sweating? It's normal to sweat if you get hot or do exercise, but you may be sweating excessively if you're sweating when your body does not need to cool down. Excessive sweating can happen for no obvious reason, because of another condition you may have, or as a side effect of a medicine you're taking. Things you can do to help with excessive sweating Do wear loose-fitting clothes to minimise signs of sweating wear socks that absorb moisture and change your socks at least twice a day if possible wear leather shoes and try to wear different shoes day to day Don’t do not wear tight clothes or synthetic fabrics – for example, nylon do not wear enclosed boots or sports shoes that may cause your feet to sweat more do not do things that might make your sweating worse – for example, drinking alcohol or eating spicy food A pharmacist can help with excessive sweating You can see a pharmacist about excessive sweating. You can buy things without a prescription, such as: stronger antiperspirants instead of deodorant armpit or sweat shields to protect your clothing foot powders for sweaty feet soap substitutes that are more gentle on your skin Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if you're sweating excessively and: things you can do yourself are not helping it's lasted for at least 6 months it stops you from getting on with your daily activities it happens at least once a week it happens at night (you're having night sweats ) you have a family history of excessive sweating you're taking medicine for another condition The GP may refer you for tests if they think another condition may be causing your sweating. Treating severe excessive sweating If there's no obvious cause for your sweating, and nothing seems to be helping, then you may be referred to a specialist (dermatologist). They may recommend other treatments that you can try, such as: taking tablets that reduce sweating treating the areas with a weak electric current passed through water or on a wet pad (iontophoresis) having botox injections for sweating under the armpits (this may not be available on the NHS) surgery – for example, removal of the sweat glands If your sweating is caused by another condition, any treatment you may need will depend on what's causing it.

    "title": "Eye cancer",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/eye-cancer/",
    "text": "Eye cancer Around 850 cases of eye cancer (ocular cancer) are diagnosed in the UK each year. There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including: eye melanoma squamous cell carcinoma lymphoma retinoblastoma – a childhood cancer Cancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts. This topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer. There is more information about other types of eye cancer on the Cancer Research UK website . Symptoms of eye cancer Eye cancer does not always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test. Symptoms of eye cancer can include: shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision blurred vision a dark patch in your eye that's getting bigger partial or total loss of vision bulging of 1 eye a lump on your eyelid or in your eye that's increasing in size eye irritation that is not going away pain in or around your eye, although this is rare These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they're not necessarily a sign of cancer. But it's important to get the symptoms checked by a doctor as soon as possible. Melanoma of the eye Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it's also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye. Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected. It can also affect the conjunctiva (the thin layer that covers the front of the eye) or the eyelid. What causes eye melanoma? Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. It's not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening: lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles , you're more at risk of developing melanoma skin cancer and eye melanoma use of sunbeds – there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their 50s. There is information about risk factors for other types of eye cancer on the Cancer Research UK website . Diagnosing melanoma of the eye If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they'll refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment. If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they'll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool and Glasgow. It's likely you'll have a number of different tests at the centre, including: an eye examination – to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities an ultrasound scan of your eye – a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size a fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour ( biopsy ). The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back. Treatments for eye melanoma Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications. Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible. The main treatments for eye melanoma are: brachytherapy – tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells external radiotherapy – a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye – this may be possible if the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye removal of the eye (enucleation) – this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you have lost your vision; the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches your other eye immunotherapy – medicine to help your immune system kill cancer, which you may have if you have a certain type of eye melanoma, or if the cancer has spread to other parts of your body Chemotherapy is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer. More information Cancer Research UK: treatment options for eye cancer Cancer Research UK: types of eye cancer surgery Outlook for eye melanoma The outlook for melanoma of the eye depends on many factors. Eye cancer is rare, so survival rates are based on all eye cancers. For people with eye cancer in England: 95 out of every 100 (95%) will live at least 1 year after diagnosis 70 out of every 100 (70%) will live at least 5 years after diagnosis 60 out of every 100 (60%) will live at least 10 years after diagnosis There is more information about eye cancer survival on the Cancer Research UK website .

Treatment for herpes simplex eye infections If a GP thinks you have a herpes simplex eye infection they'll refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). You'll usually be seen the same day so that you can start treatment quickly. You'll usually be prescribed either: an antiviral medicine such as aciclovir , taken as eye ointment, eye drops or sometimes tablets antiviral medicine with steroid eye drops to reduce swelling Most infections will get better with treatment in a couple of weeks and will not permanently affect your eyesight. It's common for herpes simplex eye infections to come back. If you keep getting them a doctor might recommend that you take antiviral tablets every day to help prevent infections. If treatment does not work or you keep getting the infections, your cornea (the transparent front part of your eye) might become scarred, causing sight loss. If this happens you might need to have a cornea transplant . Information: If you use contact lenses, do not wear them until 24 hours after all your symptoms have gone. How you get herpes simplex eye infections Most herpes simplex eye infections are caused by the same herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores . You usually get the herpes simplex virus from skin to skin contact from someone with a cold sore. Once you have it, it stays in your body. It does not usually cause any symptoms, but sometimes it can cause eye infections. This is more likely if you have a weakened immune system. It might also be triggered by an illness, stress, exposure to bright light or an eye injury. You're unlikely to pass the virus on to someone else from an eye infection, but try to avoid touching your eye, and wash your hands regularly.

    "text": "Overview - Female genital mutilation (FGM) Contents Overview National FGM Support Clinics Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a procedure where the female genitals are deliberately cut, injured or changed, but there's no medical reason for this to be done. It's also known as female circumcision or cutting, and by other terms, such as Sunna, gudniin, halalays, tahur, megrez and khitan, among others. FGM is usually carried out on young girls between infancy and the age of 15, most commonly before puberty starts. It's illegal in the UK and is child abuse. It's very painful and can seriously harm the health of women and girls. It can also cause long-term problems with sex, childbirth and mental health. Getting help and support All women and girls have the right to control what happens to their bodies and the right to say no to FGM. Help is available if you have had FGM or you're worried that you or someone you know is at risk. If someone is in immediate danger, contact the police immediately by dialling 999. If you're concerned that someone may be at risk, contact the NSPCC helpline on 0800 028 3550 or email fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk . If you're under pressure to have FGM performed on your daughter, ask a GP, your health visitor or another healthcare professional for help, or contact the NSPCC helpline. If you have had FGM, you can get help from a specialist NHS gynaecologist or FGM service – ask a GP, your midwife or any other healthcare professional about services in your area. Read about National FGM Support Clinics and where to find them . If you're a health professional caring for a patient under 18 who's had FGM, you have professional responsibilities to safeguard and protect her. Guidance and resources about FGM for healthcare staff are available on the GOV.UK website . Types of FGM There are 4 main types of FGM: type 1 (clitoridectomy) – removing part or all of the clitoris type 2 (excision) – removing part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia (the lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (the larger outer lips) type 3 (infibulation) – narrowing the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia other harmful procedures to the female genitals, including pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping or burning the area FGM is often performed by traditional circumcisers or cutters who do not have any medical training. But in some countries it may be done by a medical professional. Anaesthetics and antiseptics are not generally used, and FGM is often carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. FGM often happens against a girl's will without her consent, and girls may have to be forcibly restrained. Effects of FGM There are no health benefits to FGM and it can cause serious harm, including: constant pain pain and difficulty having sex repeated infections, which can lead to infertility bleeding, cysts and abscesses problems peeing or holding pee in (incontinence) depression , flashbacks and self-harm problems during labour and childbirth, which can be life threatening for mother and baby Some girls die from blood loss or infection as a direct result of the procedure. FGM and sex FGM can make it difficult and painful to have sex. It can also result in reduced sexual desire and a lack of pleasurable sensation. Talk to your GP or another healthcare professional if you have sexual problems that you feel may be caused by FGM, as they can refer you to a special therapist who can help. In some cases, a surgical procedure called a deinfibulation may be recommended, which can alleviate and improve some symptoms. FGM and pregnancy Some women with FGM may find it difficult to become pregnant, and those who do conceive can have problems in childbirth. If you're expecting a baby, your midwife should ask you if you have had FGM at your antenatal appointment . It's important to tell your midwife if you think this has happened to you so they can arrange appropriate care for you and you baby. FGM and mental health FGM can be an extremely traumatic experience that can cause emotional difficulties throughout life, including; depression anxiety flashbacks to the time of the cutting nightmares and other sleep problems In some cases, women may not remember having the FGM at all, especially if it was performed when they were an infant. Talk to a GP or another healthcare professional if you're experiencing emotional or mental health problems that may be a result of FGM. Help and support is available. Treatment for FGM (deinfibulation) Surgery can be performed to open up the vagina, if necessary. This is called deinfibulation. It's sometimes known as a reversal, although this name is misleading as the procedure does not replace any removed tissue and will not undo the damage caused. But it can help many problems caused by FGM. Surgery may be recommended for: women who are unable to have sex or have difficulty peeing as a result of FGM pregnant women at risk of problems during labour or delivery as a result of FGM Deinfibulation should be carried out before getting pregnant, if possible. It can be done in pregnancy or labour if necessary, but ideally should be done before the last 2 months of pregnancy. The surgery involves making a cut (incision) to open the scar tissue over the entrance to the vagina. It's usually performed under local anaesthetic in a clinic and you will not normally need to stay overnight. A small number of women need either a general anaesthetic or an injection in the back (epidural) , which may involve a short stay in hospital. Video: female genital mutilation (FGM) This video raises awareness of female genital mutilation (FGM) and has advice if you or someone else are at risk. Media last reviewed: 6 June 2024 Media review due: 6 June 2027 Why FGM is carried out FGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it will benefit the girl in some way (for example, as a preparation for marriage or to preserve her virginity). But there are no acceptable reasons that justify FGM. It's a harmful practice that has no health benefits. FGM usually happens to girls whose mothers, grandmothers or extended female family members have had FGM themselves, or if their father comes from a community where it's carried out. Where FGM is carried out Girls are sometimes taken abroad for FGM, but they may not be aware this is the reason for their travel. Girls are more at risk of FGM being carried out during the summer holidays, as this allows more time for them to \"heal\" before they return to school. If you think there's a risk of this happening to you, you can download the Statement Opposing FGM on GOV.UK and take it with you on holiday to show your family. Communities that perform FGM are traditionally found in many parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Girls who were born in the UK or are resident here but whose families originate from an FGM-practising community are at greater risk of FGM happening to them. Many communities practise FGM, but those at particular risk in the UK originate from: Somalia Egypt Sudan Sierra Leone Eritrea Gambia Ethiopia The law and FGM FGM is illegal in the UK. It's an offence to: perform FGM (including taking a child abroad for FGM) help a girl perform FGM on herself in or outside the UK help anyone perform FGM in the UK help anyone perform FGM outside the UK on a UK national or resident fail to protect a girl for whom you're responsible from FGM Anyone who performs FGM can face up to 14 years in prison. Anyone found guilty of failing to protect a girl from FGM can face up to 7 years in prison. Video: female genital mutilation - the facts This video dispels myths surrounding FGM and religion. Media last reviewed: 1 July 2022 Media review due: 1 July 2025 Download the Statement Opposing FGM The summer holidays are when many young girls are taken abroad, often to their family's birth country, to have FGM performed. The FGM statement, also known as the FGM health passport, highlights the fact FGM is a serious criminal offence in the UK. If you're worried about FGM, print out this statement, take it abroad with you and show it to your family. Keep the declaration in your passport, purse or bag, and carry it with you all the time. Download the statement opposing FGM on GOV.UK , which is also available in other languages. Leaflets to download There are leaflets for patients who want to know more about FGM on GOV.UK .

    "title": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorder/",
    "text": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder If you drink alcohol during pregnancy you risk causing harm to your baby. Sometimes this can result in mental and physical problems in the baby, called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). FASD can happen when alcohol in the mother's blood passes to her baby through the placenta. Your baby cannot process alcohol well, which means it can stay in their body for a long time. Alcohol can damage their brain and body and stop them from developing normally in the womb. This can result in the loss of the pregnancy. Babies who survive may be left with lifelong problems. Characteristics of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) FASD can cause problems with: movement, balance, vision and hearing learning, such as problems with thinking, concentration, and memory managing emotions and developing social skills hyperactivity and impulse control communication, such as problems with speech the joints, muscles, bones, and organs, such as the kidneys and heart These problems are permanent, though early treatment and support can help limit their impact on a child's life. The type of FASD symptoms a baby has and how severe they are is different depending on how often, and how much, the mother drank during pregnancy. The greater the amount of alcohol consumed, the more severe the symptoms tend to be. What to do if you think your child has fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) Speak to a GP or health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's development or think they could have FASD. If the condition is not diagnosed early and your child does not receive appropriate support, they're more likely to experience bigger challenges associated with the condition. For example, they may have difficulties with learning, have challenging behaviours, mental health problems, and find it difficult to get a job and live independently as an adult. A doctor or health visitor will need to know if your child was exposed to alcohol during pregnancy to help make a diagnosis of FASD. Your child may be referred to a specialist team for an assessment if there's a possibility they have the condition. This usually involves physical examinations and blood tests to rule out genetic conditions that have similar characteristics to FASD. Treatment and support for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) There is no particular treatment for FASD, and the damage to a child's brain and body cannot be reversed. But an early diagnosis and support can make a big difference. Once the condition has been diagnosed, a team of healthcare professionals can assess your child's needs and offer appropriate educational and behavioural strategies. You may also find it helpful to contact a support group for people with FASD. These can be a good source of advice and they may be able to connect you with other people in a similar situation. Find support from: FASD Network UK National Organisation for FASD You might also want to ask your care team if they know of any local groups in your area. Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) FASD is completely avoidable if you do not drink alcohol while you're pregnant. The risk of FASD is higher the more you drink. There's no proven \"safe\" level of alcohol in pregnancy. Not drinking at all is the safest approach. If you're pregnant and struggling with an alcohol problem, talk to a midwife or doctor. Confidential help and support is also available from: Drinkaware has a national alcohol helpline called Drinkline; if you're worried about your own or someone else's drinking, call the free helpline on 0300 123 1110 (weekdays 9am to 8pm, weekends 11am to 4pm) We Are With You – a charity providing free, confidential support for drugs, alcohol and mental health problems, and a directory of drug and alcohol services around the UK Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) – a free self-help group; its \"12-step\" programme involves getting sober with the help of regular support groups National Organisation for FASD has a helpline – 020 8458 5951 (you leave a message and someone returns your call) You can also find your nearest alcohol support services or read advice on cutting down your drinking and alcohol in pregnancy .

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fibroids/",
    "text": "Overview - Fibroids Contents Overview Diagnosis Treatment Complications Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the womb (uterus). The growths are made up of muscle and fibrous tissue, and vary in size. They're sometimes known as uterine myomas or leiomyomas. Many women are unaware they have fibroids because they do not have any symptoms. Women who do have symptoms (around 1 in 3) may experience: heavy periods or painful periods tummy (abdominal) pain lower back pain a frequent need to urinate constipation pain or discomfort during sex In rare cases, further complications caused by fibroids can affect pregnancy or cause infertility . Seeing a GP As fibroids do not often cause symptoms, they're sometimes diagnosed by chance during a routine gynaecological examination, test or scan. See a GP if you have symptoms of fibroids so they can investigate possible causes. If the GP thinks you may have fibroids, they'll usually refer you for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis. Read more about diagnosing fibroids . Why fibroids develop The exact cause of fibroids is unknown, but they have been linked to the hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen is the female reproductive hormone produced by the ovaries (the female reproductive organs). Fibroids usually develop during a woman's reproductive years (from around the age of 16 to 50) when oestrogen levels are at their highest. They tend to shrink when oestrogen levels are low, such as after the menopause when a woman's monthly period stops. Who gets fibroids? Fibroids are common, with around 2 in 3 women developing at least 1 fibroid at some point in their life. They most often occur in women aged 30 to 50. Fibroids are thought to develop more frequently in women of African-Caribbean origin. It's also thought they occur more often in overweight or obese women because being overweight increases the level of oestrogen in the body. Women who have had children have a lower risk of developing fibroids. Types of fibroids Fibroids can grow anywhere in the womb and vary in size considerably. Some can be the size of a pea, whereas others can be the size of a melon. The main types of fibroids are: intramural fibroids – the most common type of fibroid, which develop in the muscle wall of the womb subserosal fibroids – fibroids that develop outside the wall of the womb into the pelvis and can become very large submucosal fibroids – fibroids that develop in the muscle layer beneath the womb's inner lining and grow into the cavity of the womb In some cases, subserosal or submucosal fibroids are attached to the womb with a narrow stalk of tissue. These are known as pedunculated fibroids.

After the menopause, they'll often shrink without treatment. If you do have symptoms caused by fibroids, medicine to help relieve the symptoms will usually be recommended first. There are also medications available to help shrink fibroids. If these prove ineffective, surgery or other, less invasive procedures may be recommended. Read more about treating fibroids .

    "text": "Overview - Fibromyalgia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Self-help Fibromyalgia, also called fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body. Symptoms of fibromyalgia As well as widespread pain, other symptoms of fibromyalgia include: increased sensitivity to pain muscle stiffness difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep, which can make you feel very tired (fatigue) problems with mental processes (known as \"fibro-fog\"), such as difficulty concentrating or remembering things headaches irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , a digestive condition that causes stomach pain and bloating feelings of frustration, worry or low mood The symptoms of fibromyalgia are changeable – for example, they can sometimes suddenly improve or get worse. See a GP if you think you have fibromyalgia. Treatment can ease some of the symptoms, although they're unlikely to disappear completely. How fibromyalgia is treated Although there's currently no cure for fibromyalgia, there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with. Treatment tends to be a combination of: lifestyle changes, such as exercise programmes and relaxation techniques talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) medicine, such as antidepressants In particular, exercise has a number of important benefits for people with fibromyalgia, including helping to reduce pain. What causes fibromyalgia? The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it's thought to be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain and changes in the way the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and nerves) processes pain messages carried around the body. It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents. In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by things that are physical or emotional like an injury, an infection or stress. Who's affected Anyone can develop fibromyalgia, but it's more common in women than men. The condition typically develops between the ages of 25 and 55, but people of any age can get it, including children and older people. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by fibromyalgia, although research has suggested it could be a relatively common condition. Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree. One of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose. There's no specific test for the condition, and the symptoms can be similar to a number of other conditions. Support groups If you have fibromyalgia, support groups can provide an important network for talking to others living with the condition. Fibromyalgia Action UK is a charity that offers information and support to people with fibromyalgia. If you have any questions about fibromyalgia, call the charity's helpline on 0300 999 3333. Fibromyalgia Action UK also has a number of regional co-ordinators who can put you in touch with a support group near you. Another organisation you may find useful is UK Fibromyalgia .

    "text": "Febrile seizures A febrile seizure (febrile convulsion or fit) can sometimes happen when a child has a high temperature. It's not usually serious, but it's important to get medical help if your child has a seizure. A febrile seizure can seem frightening, but it's unlikely to harm your child or cause long-term effects. Check if it's a febrile seizure A febrile seizure can happen when a child has a high temperature (fever) . Your child may: become stiff and twitch, shake, or have jerking movements become unconscious not respond or look at you when you talk to them be sick or pee (wet themselves) be sleepy, irritable or confused for up to 1 hour afterwards Febrile seizures usually last for 2 to 3 minutes. It's rare for them to last more than 10 minutes. They usually affect children between 6 months and 6 years old. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if your child: has a seizure for the first time has a seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes is having difficulty breathing has stiffness and twitching on only 1 side of their body is more sleepy than usual for more than 1 hour after the seizure stops has more than 1 seizure within 24 hours Do not take your child to A&E if they are still having a seizure or are unconscious, call 999 instead. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. What to do if your child is having a febrile seizure If your child is having a febrile seizure, it's important to keep them safe while you wait for medical help. Do check the time the seizure starts and ends protect their head with your hands or something soft remove any dangerous objects that are nearby after the seizure ends, put your child in the recovery position and make sure there is nothing in their mouth or throat that might affect their breathing Don’t do not move your child or try to hold them in place do not put anything in your child's mouth do not try to lower your child's temperature by undressing them or sponging them with cold water Information: Find out how to put a baby in the recovery position on the St John Ambulance website Treatment for febrile seizures Most febrile seizures do not need treatment. But your child will need to be checked in hospital after having a febrile seizure for the first time. They may also need to stay in hospital for a short time. Your child may need some tests, including: blood tests pee (urine) test a lumbar puncture – where a sample of fluid is taken from the spine and checked for bacteria or viruses If an infection is causing your child's high temperature, they may need medicine to treat it. Treatment for recurrent febrile seizures Very rarely, a child may keep having febrile seizures. If this happens, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to give to your child while they're having a seizure. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to use it. Preventing febrile seizures You cannot prevent febrile seizures. They can sometimes happen when your child has an infection and a high temperature. Information: Febrile seizures and epilepsy Febrile seizures are not the same thing as epilepsy . Children who have had a febrile seizure have a slightly increased chance of having epilepsy later in life, but this is rare. Page last reviewed: 21 June 2023 Next review due: 21 June 2026"

They usually develop arches on the inner sides of their feet between 3 and 10 years of age. Flat feet: do not usually cause any problems should not stop you doing any activities, including sports are rarely a sign of anything serious But sometimes, you may have pain around your ankle or lower leg, or the inner side (fallen arch) of your foot may ache. Your shoes may also wear out quickly. You do not need to do anything if you or your child have flat feet and they're not causing any problems. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if you have flat feet and: your feet are painful, stiff, weak or numb you often get foot or ankle injuries you have problems with walking or balance you did not have flat feet before it only affects 1 foot These problems mean you might need treatment. Treatments for flat feet If flat feet are causing problems and you need treatment, a GP may refer you to a specialist like a podiatrist or physiotherapist. Referral to a specialist is not available everywhere and waiting times can be long. Your GP might be able to give you advice about paying to see a specialist privately. A foot specialist can offer advice about: what shoes to wear (wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel are usually best) shoe insoles to support your feet foot stretches and exercises painkillers These will not change the shape of your feet but can help with things like pain or stiffness. Surgery for flat feet Surgery is rarely needed for flat feet. It might help if there's a problem with the bones, tissues or muscles in your feet and other treatments have not worked. Your GP may refer you to a surgeon if they think surgery might help. Information: Self-refer to a podiatrist If you have flat feet, you might be able to refer yourself directly to a podiatrist without seeing a GP. To find out if there are self-referral services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS podiatrists near you Causes of flat feet There's often no obvious cause for flat feet. It might just be the way your feet are. Sometimes flat feet run in families. Rarely, flat feet may be caused by: the bones in the feet not growing properly in the womb stretching of the tissues in your feet (possibly as a result of things like an injury, getting older or being overweight) conditions affecting the muscles, nerves or joints in the whole body like cerebral palsy and spina bifida Page last reviewed: 24 January 2022 Next review due: 24 January 2025"

    "title": "Plagiocephaly and brachycephaly (flat head syndrome)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/plagiocephaly-brachycephaly/",
    "text": "Plagiocephaly and brachycephaly (flat head syndrome) Babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they're a few months old, usually as a result of them spending a lot of time lying on their back. This is known as flat head syndrome, and there are 2 main types: plagiocephaly – the head is flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical; the ears may be misaligned and the head looks like a parallelogram when seen from above, and sometimes the forehead and face may bulge a little on the flat side brachycephaly – the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen, and occasionally the forehead bulges out Credit: Created by NHSD (Annabel King) These problems are quite common, affecting around 1 in every 5 babies at some point. In most cases they are not a major cause for concern, as they do not have any effect on the brain and the head shape will often improve by itself over time. Your baby will not experience any pain or other symptoms, or any problems with their general development. What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly? The skull is made up of plates of bone that strengthen and join together as a child gets older. A young baby's skull is still relatively soft and can change shape if there's constant pressure on a particular part of their head. Reasons why this may happen include: sleeping on their back – the back or side of a baby's head can become flattened as a result of always sleeping on their back, but it's important they do this to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) problems in the womb – pressure can be placed on a baby's head before they're born if they're a bit squashed in the womb or there's a lack of amniotic fluid to cushion them being born prematurely – premature babies are more likely to develop a flattened head because their skull is softer when they're born, and they may prefer to rest their head on one side at first as they're not yet able to move their head themselves neck muscle tightness – this can prevent a baby turning their head a particular way, meaning one side of their head is placed under more pressure Occasionally, a flattened head can be caused by the plates of the skull joining together too early. This is known as craniosynostosis . When to get medical advice Speak to your health visitor or GP if you're concerned about the shape of your baby's head or think they may have problems turning their head. They can examine your baby's head and suggest things you can do to help. A slightly flattened head is not usually anything to worry about, but it's a good idea to get advice early on so you can take steps to stop it getting any worse. What you can do The shape of your baby's head should improve naturally over time as their skull develops and they start moving their head, rolling around and crawling. To take pressure off the flattened part of your baby's head: give your baby time on their tummy during the day – encourage them to try new positions during play time, but make sure they always sleep on their back as this is safest for them switch your baby between a sloping chair, a sling and a flat surface – this ensures there is not constant pressure on one part of their head change the position of toys and mobiles in their cot – this will encourage your baby to turn their head on to the non-flattened side alternate the side you hold your baby when feeding and carrying reduce the time your baby spends lying on a firm flat surface, such as car seats and prams – try using a sling or front carrier when practical If your baby has difficulty turning their head, physiotherapy may help loosen and strengthen their neck muscles. Corrective surgery may be needed if they have craniosynostosis. Find out more about how craniosynostosis is treated Helmets, headbands and mattresses There are specially designed helmets and headbands that some people claim can help improve the shape of a baby's skull as they grow. These devices apply pressure to \"bulging\" parts of the skull and relieve pressure from other parts, potentially allowing growth in the flatter areas. Treatment is started when the child's skull is still soft, usually at around 5 or 6 months old, and the device is worn almost continuously (up to 23 hours a day) for several months. But these helmets and headbands generally are not recommended because: there is not clear evidence to suggest they work they often cause problems such as skin irritation and rashes they're expensive, typically costing around £2,000 your baby will need to be checked every few weeks to monitor their head growth and make any necessary adjustments they may be uncomfortable and distressing for your baby Some people try special curved mattresses that are designed to distribute the weight of a baby's head over a larger area so less pressure is placed on a particular point of their skull. These are cheaper than helmets and headbands, but there's currently only limited evidence to suggest they may help. Will my child's head shape return to normal? Mild flattening of the head will usually improve if you use the simple measures described on this page, although it may be a couple of months before you start to notice an improvement. Your baby's head may not return to a completely perfect shape, but by the time they're 1 or 2 years old any flattening will be barely noticeable. More severe cases will also get better over time, although some flattening will usually remain. The appearance of your child's head should improve as they become more mobile and their hair grows. It's very rare for a child to experience problems such as teasing when they reach school age. You may consider using a helmet or headband if you're worried about your child, but it's not clear whether these always work. You should also bear in mind the inconvenience, expense and possible discomfort for you and your child. Page last reviewed: 03 August 2022 Next review due: 03 August 2025"

    "text": "Food colours and hyperactivity Research has found a possible link between certain artificial colours used in food and problems with hyperactivity in children. If your child is overactive and struggles to concentrate, it might help to cut down on these colours in their diet. But speak to their GP first. Food colours linked to hyperactivity All food additives, including artificial colours have an E number, which means they've passed safety tests and are approved for use in the EU. According to research funded by the Food Standards Agency, the 6 food colours most closely linked to hyperactivity in children are: E102 (tartrazine) E104 (quinoline yellow) E110 (sunset yellow FCF) E122 (carmoisine) E124 (ponceau 4R) E129 (allura red) These colours are used in several foods, including soft drinks, sweets, cakes and ice cream. Find out more about food additives, including E numbers and hyperactivity, on the Food Standards Agency website Should my child avoid these food colours? If your child is hyperactive, or has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , there's some evidence to suggest that avoiding these 6 food colours may help. But it's important to be aware that: hyperactivity can have many different causes, including genetics, and food colours are probably only a small part of the problem removing food colours from your child's diet will not necessarily lead to an improvement in their behaviour the link between food colours and hyperactivity is not completely certain; more research is needed to confirm it you do not need to avoid all E numbers; there are hundreds of different E numbers and most are not linked to hyperactivity If you think your child's diet may be affecting their behaviour, it might help to keep a diary of what they eat and how their behaviour changes, so you can see any patterns. If you notice a possible link between food colours and their behaviour, you may want to see if avoiding these colours helps. But do not make changes to your child's diet without getting advice from their GP first. How to avoid these food colours You can avoid food colours linked to hyperactivity by checking food labels and looking for alternative products that do not contain them. All artificial food colours should be included in the list of ingredients, with either their E number or full name. If any of the 6 food colours mentioned on this page are included, the label must also have a warning saying the colour \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children\". If you buy food or drink without packaging, you'll need to ask the manufacturer or the person selling the product if it contains artificial colours.

It's not usually serious, but eating the food you're intolerant to can make you feel unwell. Symptoms of a food intolerance If you have a food intolerance, you usually get symptoms a few hours after eating the food or ingredient you're intolerant to. Common symptoms include: diarrhoea bloating farting tummy pain But there are lots of other possible symptoms, including headache, feeling tired or exhausted, feeling sick, constipation, joint pain or rashes. Symptoms can last for a few hours or days. Information: Food allergy A food intolerance is different to a food allergy , which causes symptoms such as itchy skin, wheezing or swelling of the lips, face and eyes. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child have any symptoms of a food intolerance that keep coming back Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air) your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet) you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy someone faints and cannot be woken up a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face) You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised or itchy. These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital. Causes of a food intolerance A food intolerance is caused by your body not being able to digest a certain food or an ingredient in food. The most common food intolerance is lactose intolerance . This is when your body is not able to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products such as cheese and yoghurts. But you can be intolerant to any type of food or ingredient in food, such as: gluten (wheat, rye and barley) – found in foods like bread and pasta histamine – found in foods and drinks like wine and cheese caffeine – found in coffee, tea and some fizzy drinks alcohol sulphites – found in cider, beer and wine salicylates – found in some fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices monosodium glutamate (MSG) – found in ripened fruits, cured meats and savoury foods Unlike a food allergy, a food intolerance is not caused by your immune system overreacting to certain types of food, which means you cannot have a serious allergic reaction. Tests for food intolerance You may be referred to a food and nutrition specialist (dietitian) if a GP thinks you have a food intolerance. Tests you may have include: a special diet where you avoid eating the food you might be intolerant to, to see if your symptoms get better – after a few weeks you start eating the food again to see if your symptoms return blood tests a breath test if you might be lactose intolerant You may also be asked to keep a food and symptoms diary to help work out what may be triggering your symptoms. Important: Home tests Some tests you can buy that claim to diagnose food intolerances are not recommended. There's limited evidence that they give accurate results and they may suggest you should avoid multiple foods, which can be harmful. Treatment for a food intolerance If you have a food intolerance, try to avoid or reduce eating the food you're intolerant to, including foods where you're intolerant to any of the ingredients. But it's important to not cut foods out of your or your child's diet without the advice of a GP or food and nutrition specialist (dietitian). This is because you or your child could miss out on certain vitamins and minerals, which are especially important for a child's growth and development.

See a GP if your or your child's foreskin is sore or swollen. Symptoms of a tight foreskin The foreskin is the thin layer of skin that covers the end of the penis. If you or your child has a tight foreskin, it will be difficult to pull it back from the end of the penis. A tight foreskin is normal in babies and young boys. Most boys' foreskins do not pull back (retract) before the age of 5, but sometimes it's not possible until they're 10 or older. The end of a boy's penis may bulge or balloon when they pee, particularly if their foreskin is tight. A tight foreskin is not usually a problem, unless there are symptoms such as: swelling and tenderness pain when peeing or a weak flow of pee blood in urine frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) bleeding or a thick discharge from under the foreskin or an unpleasant smell – these are signs of an infection ( balanitis ) painful erections, which can make having sex difficult Things you can do if you have a tight foreskin If your or your child's foreskin is tight, but is not causing problems like pain or bleeding, there are some things you can do to help ease it and keep the penis clean. Do wash your penis regularly – use warm water or warm water and non-perfumed soap gently pull back your foreskin as far as you can, so you can clean underneath it (adults only) Don’t do not pull back the foreskin of a baby or young boy because it could be painful and damage it, leading to problems in later life do not use perfumed soap, talcum powder or deodorants on your penis because they may cause irritation Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your or your child's foreskin is tight and swollen or painful there's bleeding around your or your child's foreskin when peeing, a thick discharge from under the foreskin, or an unpleasant smell Treatments for a tight foreskin The foreskins of babies and young boys will usually loosen as they get older, so treatment is often not needed. If your or your child's foreskin is causing problems, treatments include: steroid creams or gels ( topical steroids ) to help soften the foreskin antibiotics if the foreskin or head of the penis is infected surgery – removal of the foreskin (circumcision) or a procedure where small cuts are made in the tip of the foreskin so it can be pulled back more easily (usually only suitable for children) Information: Find out more Circumcision in boys Circumcision in men British Association of Urological Surgeons: phimosis and phimosis treatments Complications of a tight foreskin Sometimes if the foreskin is very tight it can get stuck and cannot go back to its original position covering the end of the penis. The end of the penis can then become very swollen and painful. This is known as paraphimosis and it's a medical emergency. Immediate treatment is needed to avoid serious complications like restricted blood flow to the penis. A doctor may be able to return the foreskin to its original position. Sometimes surgery to remove the foreskin (circumcision) may be recommended.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/",
    "text": "Overview - Frontotemporal dementia Contents Overview Symptoms Treatment Frontotemporal dementia is an uncommon type of dementia that causes problems with behaviour and language. Dementia is the name for problems with mental abilities caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. Frontotemporal dementia affects the front and sides of the brain (the frontal and temporal lobes). Dementia mostly affects people over 65, but frontotemporal dementia tends to start at a younger age. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 45-65, although it can also affect younger or older people. Like other types of dementia, frontotemporal dementia tends to develop slowly and get gradually worse over several years. Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia Signs of frontotemporal dementia can include: personality and behaviour changes – acting inappropriately or impulsively, appearing selfish or unsympathetic, neglecting personal hygiene, overeating, or loss of motivation language problems – speaking slowly, struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word, getting words in the wrong order, or using words incorrectly problems with mental abilities – getting distracted easily, struggling with planning and organisation memory problems – these only tend to occur later on, unlike more common forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease There may also be physical problems, such as slow or stiff movements, loss of bladder or bowel control (usually not until later on), muscle weakness or difficulty swallowing . These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult, and the person may eventually be unable to look after themselves. Read more about the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia . Getting medical advice See a GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with a GP and perhaps suggest you go with them. The GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed. Read more about getting a dementia diagnosis . Tests for frontotemporal dementia There's no single test for frontotemporal dementia. The following may be needed to make a diagnosis: an assessment of symptoms – it's normally helpful to have somebody who knows the person well to give an account of their symptoms, especially as someone with frontotemporal dementia may not be aware of changes in their behaviour an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve a number of tasks and questions blood tests – to rule out conditions with similar symptoms brain scans – such as an MRI scan , a CT scan or a PET scan ; these can detect signs of dementia and help identify which parts of the brain are most affected, or help rule out other problems with the brain lumbar puncture – to test the spinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spine); this may be useful to rule out Alzheimer's disease as the cause of symptoms Read more about the tests used to diagnose dementia . Treatments for frontotemporal dementia There's currently no cure for frontotemporal dementia or any treatment that will slow it down. But there are treatments that can help control some of the symptoms, possibly for several years. Treatments include: medicines – to control some of the behavioural problems therapies – such as physiotherapy , occupational therapy , and speech and language therapy for problems with movement, everyday tasks and communication dementia activities – such as memory cafes, which are drop-in sessions for people with memory problems and their carers to get support and advice support groups – who can offer tips on managing symptoms from dementia experts and people living with frontotemporal dementia, and their families Read more about how frontotemporal dementia is treated . Outlook for frontotemporal dementia How quickly frontotemporal dementia gets worse varies from person to person and is very difficult to predict. People with the condition can become socially isolated as the illness progresses. They may not want to spend time in the company of others, or may behave in rude or insulting ways. Home-based help will usually be needed at some stage, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home. The average survival time after symptoms start is around 8 to 10 years. But this is highly variable and some people live much longer than this. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember you're not alone. The NHS and social services , as well as voluntary organisations and specialist support groups, can provide advice and support for you and your family. Read more about looking after someone with dementia. Causes of frontotemporal dementia Frontotemporal dementia is caused by clumps of abnormal protein forming inside brain cells. These are thought to damage the cells and stop them working properly. The proteins mainly build up in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain at the front and sides. These are important for controlling language, behaviour, and the ability to plan and organise. It's not fully understood why this happens, but there's often a genetic link. People who get frontotemporal dementia may have relatives who were also affected by the condition. If you have a family history of frontotemporal dementia, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about being referred to a geneticist and possibly having a genetic test to see if you're at risk. There's a lot of research being done to try to improve understanding of the causes of frontotemporal dementia so treatments can be discovered. If you're interested in helping with research, you can speak to a doctor or register your interest on the Join Dementia Research website. Other names for frontotemporal dementia Doctors sometimes use different names to describe frontotemporal dementia. These include: FTD Pick's disease frontal dementia frontotemporal lobar degeneration behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia primary progressive aphasia semantic dementia progressive non-fluent aphasia More information Living with dementia Living well with dementia Staying independent with dementia Dementia activities Looking after someone with dementia Dementia and your relationships Communicating with someone with dementia Coping with dementia behaviour changes Care and support Sources of help and support for people with dementia Dementia UK: nurse helpline Dementia and care homes Dementia, social services and the NHS Dementia and managing money Managing legal affairs for someone with dementia Dementia and end of life planning Rare Dementia Support How you can help Dementia Friend: Become a Dementia Friend Dementia UK: Admiral nurse dementia helpline Alzheimer's Society: Dementia talking points forum Page last reviewed: 29 June 2023 Next review due: 29 June 2026 Next : Symptoms"

At first, your skin may be: cold and firm numb, or you may feel a stinging or burning sensation painful, throb or ache red or pale (redness may be harder to see on black or brown skin) Credit: Danita Delimont / Alamy Stock Photo https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-antarctica-antarctic-peninsula-frostbite-victim-21308117.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=393C255B-E948-427A-9BF0-AE16A341EE4E&p=68301&n=0&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dB6JJM5%26qt_raw%3dB6JJM5%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d144292%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d0%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0%26pl%3d Frostbite gets worse the colder it is and the longer you’re exposed to the cold. If frostbite gets worse, symptoms can include: hard, frozen skin that can be white, blue or blotchy swelling and loss of feeling in the affected area blisters filled with blood or clear or milky fluid the skin turns black and hard as it starts to die (this may be harder to see on black or brown skin) Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You've been exposed to very cold temperatures and: have hard, frozen skin have swelling and loss of feeling in the affected area have blisters filled with blood or a clear or milky fluid you're constantly shivering, have slurred speech, slow breathing and are tired and confused Find your nearest A&E What to do while waiting for help with frostbite If you think you or someone you're with has frostbite, there are some things you can do while waiting for medical help. Do go indoors or somewhere sheltered as quickly as possible remove clothing and jewellery, such as gloves, rings and boots from the affected area wrap yourself in something warm like a blanket, sleeping bag or dry towel put your hands in your armpits (if your hands are affected) if you're with someone who has frostbite, place the affected body part in your lap and gently warm it with your hands place the affected body part in warm (not hot) water, dry it and put on a light dressing, such as a gauze bandage, if you have one raise the body part to reduce swelling take paracetamol to ease any pain – do not give aspirin to children under 16 have a warm drink or water Don’t do not rub the affected area do not use things like a fire, radiator, hot water bottle or heat lamp to warm the affected area do not have a hot bath to warm yourself up do not drink alcohol Important: Hypothermia If the person is shivering a lot or struggling to stay awake, they may have hypothermia (very low body temperature). Make sure they’re warm and keep them awake by talking to them until you can get medical help. Treatment for frostbite Frostbite is treated in hospital. Treatments for frostbite include: warming the affected body part removing dead skin medicines to treat swelling and infection surgery if frostbite is severe You may have follow-up appointments to check how your wounds are healing and to help with any lasting problems you might have (such as problems with movement). Complications of frostbite Frostbite can cause serious problems, especially if it’s severe. It can cause the skin and tissue to die ( gangrene ), which may mean the affected body part needs to be removed (amputated). Some people have lasting problems after having frostbite, such as pain and stiffness in the affected areas. You're also more likely to get frostbite again if the body part is exposed to cold temperatures. How to avoid getting frostbite To help avoid getting frostbite, it’s important to wear warm clothing if you're in very cold temperatures. For example, you should wear: several loose layers of clothing with a waterproof outer layer a hat and scarf to protect your head, neck and face gloves or mittens to protect your hands and fingers thick socks and boots to protect your feet and toes It’s also important to eat and drink regularly if you’re in cold conditions for long periods.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/frozen-shoulder/",
    "text": "Frozen shoulder Frozen shoulder means your shoulder is painful and stiff for months, sometimes years. It can be treated with shoulder exercises and painkillers. Symptoms of frozen shoulder The 2 main symptoms of frozen shoulder are: pain in your shoulder which can be worse at night and disturb sleep stiffness in your shoulder which makes it difficult to move Frozen shoulder can take months or years to get better. But the pain and stiffness will usually go away eventually. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have shoulder pain and stiffness that does not go away the pain is so bad it makes it hard to move your arm and shoulder Treatment for frozen shoulder Treatment for frozen shoulder works in 3 main steps: Pain relief – avoid movements that cause you pain. Only move your shoulder gently. At first, try taking paracetamol . You can take it at regular intervals, up to the recommended daily dose. If paracetamol does not work, try an oral NSAID painkiller such as ibuprofen . If it does not help stop using it. Stronger pain relief – you may be prescribed stronger painkillers or a steroid injection in your shoulder. Getting movement back – try gentle shoulder exercises at home. If the pain continues, you may be referred to a physiotherapist. You may get a mix of these treatments depending on how painful and stiff your shoulder is. Stronger pain relief is usually only used for a short time because it can cause side effects. Physiotherapy for frozen shoulder Physiotherapy can help you get movement back in your shoulder. A physiotherapist will decide on the number of sessions you need. It usually lasts at least 6 weeks. The exact number depends on how quickly your shoulder start to get better. The physiotherapist will first check how much movement you have in your shoulders. Treatments from a physiotherapist include: stretching exercises strength exercises good posture advice pain relief, including giving steroid injections If you're still in pain after you have finished your sessions, go back to your GP or physiotherapist. They might prescribe more physiotherapy or another treatment. Many physiotherapists work at GP surgeries. In some areas, you can ask to see a physiotherapist without seeing a GP first. You can also get physiotherapy privately. Find a registered physiotherapist on the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website How you can ease pain from frozen shoulder yourself There are things you can do to help ease the pain from frozen shoulder yourself. Do follow any exercises from your GP or physiotherapist move your shoulder – keeping it still will make the pain worse take paracetamol regularly up to the recommended daily dose try putting a heat pack (or hot water bottle) wrapped in a tea towel on your shoulder for up to 20 minutes at a time – you can also buy heat packs from a pharmacy Don’t do not make up your own strenuous exercises – for example, gym equipment can make the pain worse Causes of frozen shoulder It's often not clear why people get a frozen shoulder. Frozen shoulder happens when the tissue around your shoulder joint becomes inflamed. The tissue then gets tighter and shrinks, which causes pain. Frozen shoulder can happen because: you had an injury or surgery that stops you from moving your arm normally you have diabetes – it's unclear why this is, but it's important to have your regular diabetes check-ups to catch any problems early Page last reviewed: 24 June 2024 Next review due: 24 June 2027"

    "text": "Medically unexplained symptoms Many people have persistent physical symptoms, such as dizziness or pain, that don't appear to be caused by a medical condition. They are sometimes known as medically unexplained symptoms when they last for more than a few weeks, but doctors can't find a problem with the body that may be the cause. This doesn't mean the symptoms are faked or \"all in the head\" – they're real and can affect your ability to function properly. Not understanding the cause can make them even more distressing and difficult to cope with. Examples of medically unexplained symptoms Common medically unexplained symptoms include: pains in the muscles or joints back pain headaches tiredness feeling faint chest pain heart palpitations stomach problems Other, less common medically unexplained symptoms include: fits (seizures) breathlessness weakness and paralysis numbness and tingling About 1 in 4 people who see a GP have physical symptoms that cannot be explained. Possible causes of medically unexplained symptoms Many people with medically unexplained symptoms, such as tiredness, pain and heart palpitations , also have depression or anxiety . Treating an associated psychological problem can often relieve the physical symptoms. For others, the symptoms may be part of a poorly understood syndrome, such as: chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) – also known as ME irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) fibromyalgia (pain all over the body) functional neurological disorders (FNDs) – symptoms thought to be caused by nervous system problems rather than a physical condition The fact that doctors are unable to find a condition causing these symptoms isn't unusual in medicine, and it doesn't mean that nothing can be done to help you. How a GP can help A GP will aim to rule out all the possible conditions that might be causing your symptoms. You may have a thorough physical examination and blood tests . It's important to consider whether any medicine you're taking may be causing your symptoms – for example, taking painkillers long term can lead to headaches . The GP should also investigate whether you might have an associated problem, such as depression or anxiety. Physical symptoms can cause depression and anxiety, and these can in turn make the physical symptoms worse, creating a vicious circle. You should tell the GP: what your symptoms are like, when they started and what makes them better or worse what you think is the cause of your symptoms and your expectations of how tests and treatments might help how your symptoms affect what you can do – what they stop you doing how upsetting your symptoms are – how they make you feel There are a number of things you can do yourself that may help. You and the GP may identify some lifestyle changes and goals that you both think will help relieve your symptoms, such as regular physical activity and better rest. You may be referred for a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . The aim of CBT is to help you to manage your symptoms by enabling you to understand links between your symptoms, worries, feelings and how you cope. If your symptoms seem to be caused by a problem with the nervous system, you may be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in disorders of the nervous system). The neurologist may refer you for psychotherapy but will also consider other therapy options, such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy . Medicine such as antidepressants can be helpful, even if you're not depressed. However, medicine isn't always the answer – painkillers or sedatives, for example, may lead to dependence. The possible benefits of medicine always need to be weighed against the potential side effects. If you think you have an underlying condition that's been missed by your doctor, you can ask for a second opinion. Self-help There are things you can do to improve or even relieve some physical symptoms, such as taking regular exercise and managing stress. Regular exercise will help keep you fit and many people find that it also boosts their mood (learn about exercise for depression ). How much exercise you should do will depend on your current health and capabilities. Managing stress is very important because it's been linked to problems such as pain and IBS. Learn about breathing exercises for stress . Generally, planning some pleasurable personal time to unwind should help – whatever helps you relax, whether it's yoga classes, swimming, running, meditation or walking in the countryside. Find out about 5 steps to mental wellbeing Your body has a remarkable ability to recover and there's a good chance that your symptoms will improve in time, even without any specific treatment.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-cholecystitis/",
    "text": "Acute cholecystitis Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. It usually happens when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. The cystic duct is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones are very common, affecting more than 1 in 10 adults in the UK. They do not usually cause symptoms, but can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious because of the risk of complications. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with rest, intravenous fluids and antibiotics . Symptoms of acute cholecystitis The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the tummy is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike other types of abdominal pain , the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and does not go away within a few hours. Some people may have additional symptoms, such as: a high temperature feeling sick being sick sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the tummy When to get medical advice See a GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a high temperature. If you're unable to contact a GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice. It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, as there's a risk of serious complications developing if it's not treated promptly. What causes acute cholecystitis? The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. Calculous cholecystitis Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. An inflamed gallbladder can sometimes become infected by bacteria. Acalculous cholecystitis Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It's less common, but usually more serious, than calculous cholecystitis. The exact cause of acalculous cholecystitis is not known, but it's usually a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. A combination of risk factors may lead to acalculous cholecystitis, including accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns , sepsis , severe malnutrition or dehydration . Diagnosing acute cholecystitis If you have severe tummy pain, a GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with the GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand. If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests – to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your tummy – to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Treating acute cholecystitis If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Initial treatment Initial treatment will usually involve: not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medicine to relieve your pain You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home. Surgery Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis coming back and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy . There are 2 main types of cholecystectomy: open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy laparoscopic cholecystectomy – keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often recommended within 1 week of confirming acute cholecystitis. Some people who have had their gallbladder removed have symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, but it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Find out more about recovering from gallbladder removal Alternatives to surgery Sometimes surgery may not be an option – for example, if you have another condition that makes surgery unsuitable. If surgery is not an option, you may be offered a procedure to drain away the fluid that has collected in your gallbladder. A narrow tube is inserted into the gallbladder to make an opening for the fluid to drain. This can be done through a cut made in the skin of your tummy, or using an endoscopic procedure (through your mouth and into the stomach). Possible complications Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) – which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) – which can spread the infection within your tummy (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about 2 or 3 in every 10 cases of acute cholecystitis. Preventing acute cholecystitis It's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones. One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Living with overweight or obesity also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly . But low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best. Find out more about preventing gallstones The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. It's an organ that's useful, but not essential, and it can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.

    "text": "Overview - Gallstones Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Prevention Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. In most cases, they do not cause any symptoms and do not need to be treated. Symptoms of gallstones Gallstones often have no symptoms. But if a gallstone becomes trapped in an opening (duct) inside the gallbladder, it can trigger a sudden, intense pain in your tummy that usually lasts between 1 and 5 hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic. Some people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder ( cholecystitis ). This can cause: persistent pain yellowing of the skin and eyes ( jaundice ) a high temperature When gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it's known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. It's passed from the liver into the gallbladder through a series of channels known as bile ducts. The bile is stored in the gallbladder and, over time, becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. Causes of gallstones Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones. Gallstones are very common. It's estimated more than 1 in every 10 adults in the UK has gallstones, although only a minority of people develop symptoms. You're more at risk of developing gallstones if you're: overweight or obese female (particularly if you have had children) 40 or over (the risk increases as you get older) Treating gallstones Treatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing: symptoms, such as tummy pain complications, such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis In these cases, keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended. This procedure, known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy , is relatively simple to perform and has a low risk of complications. It's possible to lead a normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but the bile will drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than build up in the gallbladder. Outlook Gallstone disease is usually easily treated with surgery. Very severe cases can be life threatening, particularly in people who are already in poor health. But deaths from gallstone disease are rare in the UK. Video: gallstones In this video, a doctor explains what gallstones are, the symptoms and the treatment options.

Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most common on the wrists (particularly the back of the wrist), hands and fingers. Ganglions are harmless, but can sometimes be painful. If they do not cause any pain or discomfort, they can be left alone and may disappear without treatment, although this can take a number of years. It's not clear why ganglions form. They seem to happen when the synovial fluid that surrounds a joint or tendon leaks out and collects in a sac. Treatment for a ganglion cyst Treatment is usually only recommended if the cyst causes pain or affects the range of movement in a joint. The 2 main treatment options for a ganglion cyst are: draining fluid out of the cyst with a needle and syringe (aspiration) cutting the cyst out using surgery Availability on the NHS Most integrated care boards (ICBs) do not fund treatment for ganglion cysts unless they cause significant pain or disrupt daily activities. If you want to have a cyst removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll probably have to pay for private treatment. Aspiration Aspiration is usually carried out in the outpatient department of your local hospital. Your doctor will use a needle and syringe to remove as much of the contents of the ganglion as possible. The area is sometimes also injected with a dose of steroid medication to help prevent the ganglion returning, although there's no clear evidence this reduces the risk of it coming back. After the procedure, a plaster is placed over the small hole in your skin. This can be removed about 6 hours after the procedure. Aspiration is simple and painless, and you'll be able to leave the hospital straight after. It's often the first treatment option offered for ganglion cysts as it's less invasive than surgery. But around half of all ganglion cysts treated using aspiration return at some point. If a cyst does return, surgery may be necessary. Surgery There are 2 ways surgery can be used to remove a ganglion cyst: open surgery – where the surgeon makes a medium-sized cut, usually about 5cm (2in) long, over the site of the affected joint or tendon arthroscopy – a type of keyhole surgery where smaller cuts are made and a tiny camera called an arthroscope is used by the surgeon to look inside the joint; using the arthroscope as a guide, they then pass instruments through the cut to remove the cyst Both techniques can be performed under either local anaesthetic, where you're awake but will not feel any pain, or general anaesthetic , where you're asleep during the operation. The choice depends on where the ganglion is, which anaesthetic you'd prefer and what your surgeon thinks is best. Open or keyhole surgery? Both techniques are equally effective at removing the cyst and reducing the risk of it returning. Keyhole surgery tends to cause less pain after the operation, but waiting times are often longer. After the operation The surgeon will stitch up the wound and a bandage will be placed over the area. This helps keep it clean, reducing the risk of infection, as well as keeping it safe from any accidental bumps. The wound is not usually painful, but you'll be given painkillers to take if you feel any discomfort after the operation. If the cyst was removed from your wrist or hand, you may need to wear a sling for the first few days. This helps keep your arm safe from any accidental knocks, and may help reduce swelling and discomfort. Move your fingers regularly to help keep the joints flexible. Surgery to remove a ganglion cyst leaves a scar, which can occasionally be thick and red. For some people, the skin around the scar remains numb after the operation. You'll usually experience some bruising in the area after your operation, but this should fade quickly. There's also a small possibility of temporary stiffness, swelling or pain afterwards. This may be caused by a minor infection treatable with antibiotics . Lasting pain or stiffness may need further treatment with physiotherapy . How much time you need to take off work after surgery to remove a ganglion cyst largely depends on your job and where the ganglion is. If your job involves manual labour, you may need to take time off. You can usually start driving again once it feels safe. Complications Having a ganglion cyst removed is a minor procedure, so complications are rare and seldom serious. But a small number of people experience permanent stiffness and pain after surgery. If you have the operation under general anaesthetic, there's also a very small risk of complications to your heart and lungs. Pre-assessment tests before surgery should make sure your risks are as low as possible. There's always a chance a ganglion cyst will come back after treatment. This is more likely if the ganglion is on certain areas of the wrist. Page last reviewed: 11 October 2021 Next review due: 11 October 2024"

    "text": "Overview - Gangrene Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Gangrene is a serious condition where a loss of blood supply causes body tissue to die. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands. Gangrene can occur as a result of an injury, infection or a long-term condition that affects blood circulation. Symptoms of gangrene include: red, purple or black skin in the affected area, which may be harder to see on black or brown skin swelling of the skin in the affected area either a loss of sensation or severe pain in the affected area sores or blisters in the affected area that bleed or produce a foul-smelling pus You should see your GP immediately if you're worried you may have gangrene. Read more about the symptoms of gangrene and diagnosing gangrene . Who's affected Anyone can develop gangrene, particularly after a serious injury, but there are certain groups of people who are more at risk. These include people with long-term conditions that can affect the blood vessels, such as: diabetes – a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high atherosclerosis – where the arteries become clogged up with a fatty substance called plaque, narrowing them and restricting blood flow peripheral arterial disease – where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles Raynaud's – where blood vessels in certain parts of the body, usually the fingers or toes, react abnormally to cold temperatures Read more about the causes of gangrene . How gangrene is treated The earlier treatment for gangrene begins, the more successful it's likely to be. The main treatments include surgery to remove damaged tissue, known as debridement, and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection. In some cases, surgery may be needed to restore blood flow to the affected area. In more severe cases, it may be necessary to remove an entire body part such as a toe, foot, or lower leg. This is known as amputation . Read more about treating gangrene . Preventing gangrene Many cases of gangrene can be prevented. If you have a condition that increases your risk of getting gangrene, such as diabetes, it's important you have regular check-ups to assess the state of your feet. Report any problems to your GP as soon as possible. Stopping smoking if you smoke and adopting a healthy lifestyle, with a low-fat diet and regular exercise, can also improve your circulation and reduce your risk of developing gangrene.

    "text": "Heartburn and acid reflux Heartburn is a burning feeling in the chest caused by stomach acid travelling up towards the throat (acid reflux). If it keeps happening, it may be called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Symptoms of acid reflux The main symptoms of acid reflux are: heartburn – a burning sensation in the middle of your chest an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, caused by stomach acid You may also have: a cough or hiccups that keep coming back a hoarse voice bad breath bloating and feeling sick Symptoms are often worse after eating, when lying down and when bending over.

Treatment for heartburn and acid reflux from a GP If you have acid reflux, a GP may prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces how much acid your stomach makes. PPIs include: omeprazole lansoprazole You'll usually need to take this type of medicine for 4 or 8 weeks, depending on how serious your acid reflux is. Go back to the GP if your symptoms return after stopping your medicine. You may need a long-term prescription. Important If a PPI does not help, your doctor may suggest trying a different type of medicine called an H2 receptor antagonist, such as famotidine. Tests and treatments for severe heartburn and acid reflux If medicines do not help or your symptoms are severe, a GP may refer you to a specialist for: tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, such as a gastroscopy (where a thin tube with a camera inside it is passed down your throat and into your stomach) tests to check for bacteria that can cause heartburn – this can be treated with a combination of antibiotics and PPIs surgery on your stomach or food pipe (oesophagus) to stop acid reflux Page last reviewed: 20 November 2023 Next review due: 20 November 2026"

    "title": "Overview-Gender dysphoria",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/",
    "text": "Overview - Gender dysphoria Contents Overview Signs How to get help and support Treatment Gender dysphoria is a term that describes a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity. This sense of unease or dissatisfaction may be so intense it can lead to depression and anxiety and have a harmful impact on daily life. What is gender identity? Gender identity refers to our sense of who we are and how we see and describe ourselves. Most people identify as \"male\" or \"female\". These are sometimes called \"binary\" identities. But some people feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex. For example, some people may have male genitals and facial hair but do not identify as a male or feel masculine. Some may have female genitals and breasts but do not identify as a female or feel feminine. Some people do not define themselves as having a \"binary\" identity. For them the concept of gender is not relevant to their identity. They may use different terms, such as agender, gender diverse, gender non-conforming, to describe their identity. However, as a group, they are often called \"non-binary\". Gender dysphoria and gender identity Many people with gender dysphoria have a strong, lasting desire to live a life that \"matches\" or expresses their gender identity. They do this by changing the way they look and behave. Some people with gender dysphoria, but not all, may want to use hormones and sometimes surgery to express their gender identity. Gender dysphoria is not a mental illness, but some people may develop mental health problems because of gender dysphoria. Signs of gender dysphoria People with gender dysphoria may have changed their appearance, their behaviour or their interests. They may also show signs of discomfort or distress, including: low self-esteem becoming withdrawn or socially isolated depression or anxiety taking unnecessary risks neglecting themselves Read more about the signs of gender dysphoria . Children and gender identity Children may show an interest in clothes or toys that society tells us are more often associated with the opposite gender. They may be unhappy with their physical sex characteristics. However, this type of behaviour is reasonably common in childhood and is part of growing up. It does not mean that all children behaving this way have gender dysphoria or other gender identity issues. A small number of children may feel lasting and severe distress, which gets worse as they get older. This often happens around puberty, when young people might feel that their physical appearance does not match their gender identity. This feeling can continue into adulthood with some people having a strong desire to change parts of their physical appearance, such as facial hair or breasts. Find out more information if you think your child might be trans or non-binary . How to get help See a GP if you think you or your child may have gender dysphoria. If the GP agrees, they can refer you to a gender dysphoria clinic (GDC) where you’ll be assessed by a specialist team. You do not need to be assessed by a mental health service first, and the GP does not need prior approval from the integrated care boards (ICBs) responsible for local health services. You can self-refer to a GDC, but a referral by the GP is best. This is because they can give the GDC your detailed medical history. If you are already seeing a doctor or psychologist for other conditions, ask them if they can refer you to a GDC. Referrals for children and young people should be sent to the National Referral Support Service for the NHS Children and Young People's Gender Service . Referrals for adults to one of the gender dysphoria clinics in England may be made from 17 years of age. Waiting times As there has been a huge increase in the number of people seeking a referral to a gender dysphoria clinic, waiting times can be long. Find out how your GP and other organisations can support you while you wait to see a GDC . Treatment for gender dysphoria After a detailed assessment to confirm the diagnosis of gender dysphoria and what it means for you, the GDC team will work with you on an agreed treatment plan. If you are assessed as not having gender dysphoria, the GDC may recommend other forms of support to your GP. Treatments provided by the GDC are intended to provide lasting relief from gender dysphoria. This can mean different things to different people. For some people, treatment may just involve acceptance and affirmation or confirmation of their identity. For others, it may involve bigger changes, such as changes to their voice, hormone treatment or surgery. Read more about treatments for gender dysphoria . What causes gender dysphoria? The exact cause of gender dysphoria is unclear. Gender development is complex and there are still things that are not known or fully understood. Gender dysphoria is not related to sexual orientation. People with gender dysphoria may identify as straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual. How common is gender dysphoria? No one really knows because not all people who have a sense of unease about their identity, or already identify as gender diverse, need or ask for support from the NHS. The number of people being referred and diagnosed with the condition has increased a lot over the last decade. In 2018/19 around 8,000 people were referred to adult gender dysphoria services in England.

Symptoms clear up on their own but can come back. Symptoms of genital herpes Symptoms of genital herpes include: small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around your genitals, anus, thighs or bottom – the sores may be less red on brown or black skin tingling, burning or itching around your genitals pain when you pee discharge that is not usual for you Where genital herpes symptoms appear and what they look like Genital herpes can appear as a blister on the vagina. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/529674/view Blisters can also appear on the penis in a group. Credit: Clinical Photography/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/861692/view You can also get blisters and sores on the buttocks. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/683453/view Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic as soon as possible if: you have symptoms of genital herpes Go even if you have not had sex for a long time, as blisters can take months or years to appear. Information: Why you should go to a sexual health clinic You can see a GP, but they'll probably refer you to a sexual health clinic if they think you might have genital herpes. Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urine system. Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment. They'll often get test results quicker than GP practices and you do not have to pay a prescription fee for treatment. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at a sexual health clinic The doctor or nurse at the sexual health clinic will: ask about your symptoms and your sexual partners use a small cotton bud (swab) to take some fluid from 1 of your blisters or sores for testing The test cannot: be done if you do not have visible blisters or sores tell you how long you've had herpes or who you got it from Symptoms might not appear for weeks or even years after you're infected with the herpes virus. Treatment for genital herpes There's no cure for genital herpes. Symptoms clear up by themselves, but the blisters can come back (an outbreak or recurrence). Treatment from a sexual health clinic can help. Treatment the first time you have genital herpes You may be prescribed: antiviral medicine to stop the symptoms getting worse – you need to start taking this within 5 days of the symptoms appearing cream for the pain If you've had symptoms for more than 5 days before you go to a sexual health clinic, you can still get tested to find out the cause. Treatment if the blisters come back Go to a GP or sexual health clinic if you've been diagnosed with genital herpes and need treatment for an outbreak. Antiviral medicine may help shorten an outbreak by 1 or 2 days if you start taking it as soon as symptoms appear. But outbreaks usually settle by themselves, so you may not need treatment. Recurrent outbreaks are usually milder than the first episode of genital herpes. Over time, outbreaks tend to happen less often and be less severe. Some people never have outbreaks. Some people who have more than 6 outbreaks in a year may benefit from taking antiviral medicine for 6 to 12 months. If you still have outbreaks of genital herpes during this time, you may be referred to a specialist. How to deal with outbreaks yourself There are things you can do if you've been diagnosed with genital herpes and you're having an outbreak. Do keep the area clean using plain or salt water to prevent blisters becoming infected apply an ice pack wrapped in a flannel to soothe pain apply petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) or painkilling cream (such as 5% lidocaine ) to reduce pain when you pee wash your hands before and after applying cream or jelly pee while pouring water over your genitals to ease the pain Don’t do not wear tight clothing that may irritate blisters or sores do not put ice directly on the skin do not touch your blisters or sores unless you're applying cream do not have vaginal, anal or oral sex until the sores have gone away How genital herpes is passed on Genital herpes is very easy to pass on (contagious) from the first tingling or itching of a new outbreak (before any blisters appear) to when sores have fully healed. You may also be able to pass on the virus even if you do not have any symptoms. You can get genital herpes: from skin-to-skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex) when there are no visible sores or blisters if a cold sore touches your genitals by transferring the infection on fingers from someone else to your genitals by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes You cannot get genital herpes from towels, swimming pools, saunas or toilet seats as there is no skin-to-skin contact. Protecting against genital herpes You can reduce the chances of passing on genital herpes by: using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex – but herpes can still be passed on if the condom does not cover the infected area avoiding vaginal, anal or oral sex if you or your partner has blisters or sores, or a tingle or itch that means an outbreak is coming not sharing sex toys – if you do, wash them and put a condom on them Why genital herpes comes back Genital herpes is caused by a virus called herpes simplex. Once you have the virus, it stays in your body. It will not spread in your body to cause blisters elsewhere. It stays in a nearby nerve and causes blisters in the same area. If you can, avoid things that trigger your symptoms. Triggers can include: ultraviolet light on the affected area – for example, from sunbathing or sunbeds friction in your genital area – for example, from sex (lubricant may help) or tight clothing smoking drinking alcohol Some triggers are unavoidable, including: being unwell stress during the menstrual cycle surgery on your genital area a weakened immune system – for example, from having chemotherapy for cancer Genital herpes and HIV Genital herpes can be a more serious condition for people with HIV . If you have HIV and herpes, you'll be referred to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) specialist. Genital herpes and pregnancy Women who have had genital herpes before pregnancy can usually expect to have a healthy baby and a vaginal delivery. However, if you have a herpes outbreak when you give birth, or you get genital herpes for the first time during pregnancy, there's a risk your baby could develop a serious illness called neonatal herpes . You'll be offered medicine from around 32 weeks of pregnancy to reduce this risk. Neonatal herpes can be fatal, but most babies recover with treatment. The risk of your baby getting neonatal herpes is low if you've had genital herpes before. It's higher if you get genital herpes for the first time within the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy. Important See your midwife or a GP if you think you have genital herpes in pregnancy. Genital herpes treatment in pregnancy You may be offered antiviral treatment: to treat outbreaks in pregnancy from week 32 of pregnancy to reduce the chance of an outbreak during birth from diagnosis until the birth if you first get herpes after week 28 of pregnancy Many women with genital herpes have a vaginal delivery. You may be offered a caesarean, depending on your circumstances. Video: Genital herpes - Marian's story In this video, Marian talks about the symptoms, treatment and issues surrounding herpes.

Information: Why you should go to a sexual health clinic A GP will probably refer you to a sexual health clinic if they think you might have genital warts. Sexual health clinics specialise in treating problems with the genitals and urine system. Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service where you do not need an appointment. Sexual health clinics often get test results quicker than GP surgeries. You also do not have to pay a prescription charge for medicines prescribed by a sexual health clinic. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at a sexual health clinic A doctor or nurse at a sexual health clinic will usually be able to diagnose genital warts by looking at them. They may: ask you about your symptoms and sexual partners look at the lumps around your genitals and anus, sometimes using a magnifying lens possibly need to look inside your vagina, anus or urethra (tube where pee comes out), depending on where the warts are It may not be possible to find out who you got genital warts from, or how long you've had the infection. Treatments for genital warts Treatment for genital warts is not always needed. They sometimes disappear on their own within 6 months. If treatment is recommended, it will need to be prescribed by a doctor. The type of treatment you'll be offered depends on what the warts look like and where they are. The doctor or nurse will discuss this with you. Treatments for genital warts include: cream, liquid or ointment – you can usually apply these yourself, but if the area is large, a doctor or nurse will need to apply it (these treatments can cause pain, irritation or a burning sensation) freezing (cryotherapy) – this treatment may need to be repeated several times and can be painful surgery – the warts are cut out after numbing the affected area with local anaesthetic , or they may be removed using heat or a laser (these treatments can cause pain, irritation or scarring) It may take weeks or months for genital wart treatment to work and the warts may come back. Sometimes the treatment does not work. Tell the doctor or nurse if you're pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, as some treatments will not be suitable for you. Some creams can weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms if it comes into contact with them. Ask the doctor or nurse about this. Things you can do while having treatment for genital warts There are some things you can do while having treatment for genital warts. Do follow the instructions about how to apply creams, liquids and ointments carefully – some creams should only be left on for a certain amount of time before being washed off avoid getting any treatment you apply to genital warts on normal skin or in open wounds Don’t do not use wart treatment from a pharmacy because they're not made for genital warts do not smoke – many treatments for genital warts work better if you do not smoke do not have vaginal, anal or oral sex until the warts have gone (but if you do have sex, always use a condom) How genital warts are passed on Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) . The virus can be passed on even when there are no visible warts. Many people with the virus do not have symptoms but can still pass it on. If you have genital warts, your current sexual partners should consider getting checked because they may have warts and not know it. After you get the infection, it can take weeks to many months before symptoms appear. You can get genital warts from: skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal and anal sex sharing sex toys oral sex, but this is rare The virus can also be passed to a baby from its mother during birth, but this is rare. Genital warts can be spread if you touch an infected area and then touch another part of your body. You cannot get genital warts from kissing or from sharing things like towels, cutlery, cups or toilet seats. Stopping genital warts being passed on You can stop genital warts being passed on by: using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex – but if the virus is in any skin that's not protected by a condom, it can still be passed on not having sex while you're having treatment for genital warts not sharing sex toys – if you do share them, wash them or cover them with a new condom before anyone else uses them HPV vaccine The HPV vaccine offered to 12 to 13 year-old girls and boys in England protects against genital warts and some cancers (such as cervical cancer and anal cancer). The HPV vaccine is also offered to men (up to and including 45 years old) who have sex with men, some trans men and trans women, sex workers and people living with HIV. Find out more about the HPV vaccine Genital warts and pregnancy Genital warts are not usually harmful during pregnancy. But you'll usually be referred to a sexual health specialist if you have genital warts and you’re pregnant. During pregnancy, genital warts may: multiply and get bigger (they may be removed if they're very big) become more easily irritated be passed on to the baby during birth, but this is rare (the HPV virus can cause infection in the baby’s throat or genitals) Most creams, liquids and ointments used to treat genital warts are not recommended during pregnancy. Genital warts often disappear on their own within 6 weeks after the baby is born, so treatment is often delayed until after the birth. Page last reviewed: 10 July 2023 Next review due: 10 July 2026"

It usually gets better in about a week, but it can be serious if you get it when you're pregnant. Symptoms of rubella The main symptom of rubella is a spotty rash that starts on the face or behind the ears and spreads to the neck and body. The rash takes 2 to 3 weeks to appear after getting rubella. The rash looks red or pink on white skin. Credit: PR. PH. FRANCESCHINI/CNRI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/259748/view It can be harder to see on brown or black skin, but might feel rough or bumpy. Credit: DR P.

MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/259236/view Rubella can also cause: aching fingers, wrists or knees a high temperature coughs sneezing and a runny nose headaches a sore throat sore, red eyes Information: It's very unlikely to be rubella if you have had both doses of the MMR vaccine or had rubella before. See other rashes in children and babies Non-urgent advice: Call a GP if: you or your child have symptoms of rubella Rubella can spread to others. It's best to call before you go in. The GP may suggest talking over the phone. How to look after yourself or your child Rubella usually gets better in about a week. After getting advice from a GP, you or your child should: get plenty of rest drink lots of fluids, like water or squash take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you're uncomfortable – do not give aspirin to children under 16 How to avoid spreading rubella Rubella spreads in coughs and sneezes. It’s infectious from 1 week before the symptoms start and for 5 days after the rash first appears. It can be serious for some people, so you should try to avoid spreading it to others. Do stay off nursery, school, or work for 5 days after the rash appears try to avoid close contact with anyone who is pregnant wash your hands often with soap and warm water use tissues when you cough or sneeze throw used tissues in the bin Don’t do not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, or bedding Rubella in pregnancy Rubella is very rare in pregnancy. But if you get it when you're pregnant, rubella could harm your baby. It can cause: loss of the baby ( miscarriage ) serious problems after the baby is born – such as problems with their sight, hearing, heart, or brain The risk is highest if you get rubella early in pregnancy. There's not thought to be a risk to your baby if you get rubella after week 20 of your pregnancy. Urgent advice: Call your midwife, maternity unit, or GP immediately if: You're pregnant and either: you have a new rash you’ve been in close contact with someone who has rubella Get vaccinated against rubella The MMR vaccine can prevent rubella. It also protects you from measles and mumps . The MMR vaccine is offered to all children in the UK. 2 doses can give lifelong protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. Ask at your GP surgery if you're not sure you or your child have had the vaccine. They can give it for free on the NHS.

    "title": "Overview-Gestational diabetes",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/",
    "text": "Overview - Gestational diabetes Contents Overview Treatment Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth. It can happen at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second or third trimester. It happens when your body cannot produce enough insulin – a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels – to meet your extra needs in pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby during pregnancy and after birth. But the risks can be reduced if the condition is detected early and well managed. Who's at risk of gestational diabetes Any woman can develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but you're at an increased risk if: you are over 40 your body mass index (BMI) is above 30 – use the BMI healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI you previously had a baby who weighed 4.5kg (10lb) or more at birth you had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy 1 of your parents or siblings has diabetes you are of south Asian, Black, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern origin (even if you were born in the UK) you have had a gastric bypass or other weight-loss surgery If any of these apply to you, you should be offered screening for gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. Symptoms of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes does not usually cause any symptoms. Most cases are only discovered when your blood sugar levels are tested during screening for gestational diabetes. Some women may develop symptoms if their blood sugar levels gets too high (hyperglycaemia) , such as: increased thirst needing to pee more often than usual a dry mouth tiredness blurred eyesight genital itching or thrush But some of these symptoms are common during pregnancy and are not necessarily a sign of gestational diabetes. Speak to your midwife or doctor if you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing. How gestational diabetes can affect your pregnancy Most women with gestational diabetes have otherwise normal pregnancies with healthy babies. However, gestational diabetes can cause problems such as: your baby growing larger than usual – this may lead to difficulties during the delivery and increases the likelihood of needing induced labour or a caesarean section polyhydramnios – too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) in the womb, which can cause premature labour or problems at delivery premature birth – giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy pre-eclampsia – a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy complications if not treated your baby developing low blood sugar or yellowing of the skin and eyes ( jaundice ) after he or she is born, which may require treatment in hospital the loss of your baby ( stillbirth ) – though this is rare Having gestational diabetes also means you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. Screening for gestational diabetes During your first antenatal appointment (also called a booking appointment) at around week 8 to 12 of your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will ask you some questions to determine whether you're at an increased risk of gestational diabetes. If you have 1 or more risk factors for gestational diabetes you should be offered a screening test. The screening test is called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which takes about 2 hours. It involves having a blood test in the morning, when you have not had any food or drink for 8 to 10 hours (though you can usually drink water, but check with the hospital if you're unsure). You're then given a glucose drink. After resting for 2 hours, another blood sample is taken to see how your body is dealing with the glucose. The OGTT is done when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. If you've had gestational diabetes before, you'll be offered an OGTT earlier in your pregnancy, soon after your booking appointment, then another OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Find out more at Lab Tests Online: Glucose Tests. Treatments for gestational diabetes If you have gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with your pregnancy can be reduced by controlling your blood sugar levels. You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment. Blood sugar levels may be reduced by changing your diet and being more active if you can. Gentle activities such as walking, swimming and prenatal yoga can help reduce blood sugar. But tell your midwife or doctor before starting an activity you haven’t done before. However, if these changes don't lower your blood sugar levels enough, you will need to take medicine as well. This may be tablets or insulin injections. You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems. If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour does not start naturally by this time. Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled. Find out more about how gestational diabetes is treated . Long-term effects of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes normally goes away after birth. But women who've had it are more likely to develop: gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies type 2 diabetes – a lifelong type of diabetes You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and once every year after that if the result is normal. See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth – do not wait until your next test. You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes do not have any symptoms. You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly. Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life. Information: If you have a history of gestational diabetes, or currently have it, the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme can support you. If you self-refer to the programme, you can get help with diet, exercise and maintaining your weight. Planning future pregnancies If you've had gestational diabetes before and you're planning to get pregnant, make sure you get checked for diabetes. Your GP can arrange this. If you do have diabetes, you should be referred to a diabetes pre-conception clinic for support to ensure your condition is well controlled before you get pregnant. Read more about diabetes in pregnancy . If you have an unplanned pregnancy, talk to your GP and tell them you had gestational diabetes in your previous pregnancy. If tests show you do not have diabetes, you'll be offered screening earlier in pregnancy (soon after your first midwife appointment) and another test at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Alternatively, your midwife or doctor may suggest you test your blood sugar levels yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous gestational diabetes.

    "text": "Temporal arteritis Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) is where the arteries, particularly those at the side of the head (the temples), become inflamed. It's serious and needs urgent treatment. Symptoms of temporal arteritis The symptoms of temporal arteritis depend on which arteries are affected. The main symptoms are: frequent, severe headaches pain or tenderness at the side of your head (temples) or on the scalp jaw pain while eating or talking vision problems, such as double vision or loss of vision in 1 or both eyes More general symptoms are also common – for example, flu-like symptoms, unintentional weight loss, depression and tiredness. Some people with temporal arteritis also develop polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) . This causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you think you might have temporal arteritis It can lead to serious problems like stroke and blindness if not treated quickly. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Tests for temporal arteritis If you see a GP about temporal arteritis, they’ll ask about your symptoms and examine your temples. After having some blood tests, you'll be referred to a specialist. They may carry out further tests to help diagnose temporal arteritis. You may have: an ultrasound scan of your temples a biopsy under local anaesthetic – where a small piece of the temporal artery is removed and checked for signs of temporal arteritis If you have problems with your vision, you should have a same-day appointment with an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) at a hospital eye department. Treatment for temporal arteritis Temporal arteritis is treated with steroid medicine , usually prednisolone . Treatment will be started before temporal arteritis is confirmed because of the risk of vision loss if it's not dealt with quickly. There are 2 stages of treatment: An initial high dose of steroids for a few weeks to help bring your symptoms under control. A lower steroid dose (after your symptoms have improved) given over a longer period of time, possibly several years. A small number of people may need to take steroids for the rest of their life. You'll have regular follow-ups to see how you're doing and check for any side effects you may have. Important: Steroids Do not suddenly stop taking steroids unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine could make you very ill. Other treatments You may also need to take other types of medicine if you have temporal arteritis, including: : low-dose aspirin – to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack, which can happen if the arteries to your heart are affected proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – to lower your risk of getting a stomach problem like indigestion or a stomach ulcer , which can be a side effect of taking prednisolone bisphosphonate therapy – to reduce the risk of osteoporosis when taking prednisolone immunosuppressants – to allow steroid medicine to be reduced and help prevent temporal arteritis coming back Page last reviewed: 14 August 2023 Next review due: 14 August 2026"

    "text": "Giardiasis Giardiasis is a tummy bug that causes symptoms like diarrhoea, farting and bloating. It usually goes away in about a week if it's treated, but it can sometimes last much longer. How giardiasis is spread You can get giardiasis through direct contact with infected people or animals, or from swallowing contaminated water, food or drinks. There are lots of ways you can catch it, such as: drinking water that's contaminated by the poo of infected people or animals eating food that's been washed in contaminated water or handled by someone with giardiasis water getting in your mouth while swimming in places like lakes, rivers or swimming pools touching surfaces that have been touched by an infected person having sex with someone infected with giardiasis – especially unprotected anal and oral sex Symptoms of giardiasis The main symptoms of giardiasis are: smelly diarrhoea tummy pain or cramps farting (flatulence) smelly burps – they may smell like eggs bloating weight loss You can have giardiasis and spread it to others without having any symptoms. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have had diarrhoea for more than 7 days you have bloody diarrhoea or bleeding from your bottom You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Tell anyone you speak to if you have recently travelled abroad. Treatment for giardiasis A GP may send off a sample of your poo for tests to check if you have giardiasis. It's treated with antibiotics. Your symptoms should stop in about a week, but they can sometimes last longer. Sometimes the people you live with may also need to be tested and treated. Important Go back to a GP if you still have symptoms a week after starting treatment. They might give you more antibiotics or refer you to a specialist for treatment. How to avoid spreading giardiasis There are things you can do if you have giardiasis to avoid spreading it. Do wash your hands with soap and water frequently separate clothing and bedding that may be contaminated from other laundry and wash it on a hot wash clean toilet seats, flush handles, taps, surfaces and door handles regularly Don’t do not prepare food for other people, if possible do not share towels, wash cloths, flannels, cutlery and utensils do not use a swimming pool until 2 weeks after your symptoms stop Important You're most infectious from when your symptoms start until 2 days after they have passed. Stay off school or work until your symptoms have stopped for 2 days. How to look after yourself if you have giardiasis To look after yourself while you have giardiasis: drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration, such as water and squash – if you're well hydrated, your pee should be light yellow or clear do not drink alcohol while you're taking antibiotics – alcohol can react with the main antibiotics used to treat giardiasis If your baby has giardiasis, give them breast or bottle feeds as usual.

    "title": "Gilbert's syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gilberts-syndrome/",
    "text": "Gilbert's syndrome In Gilbert's syndrome, slightly higher than normal levels of a substance called bilirubin build up in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance found naturally in the blood. It forms as a by-product when old red blood cells are broken down. Symptoms of Gilbert's syndrome Most people with Gilbert's syndrome have occasional and short-lived episodes of yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ). It's caused by the build-up of bilirubin in the blood. Jaundice may be less obvious if you have brown or black skin, but you may notice the white part of your eyes looks yellow. As Gilbert's syndrome usually only causes a slight increase in bilirubin levels, the yellowing of jaundice is often mild. The eyes are usually affected most. Around 1 in 3 people with Gilbert's syndrome do not experience any symptoms at all. You may not realise you have Gilbert's syndrome until tests for an unrelated problem are carried out. When to see a GP See a GP if you have an episode of jaundice for the first time. The jaundice of Gilbert's syndrome is usually mild, but jaundice can be associated with more serious liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C . It's important to get immediate medical advice from a GP if you have jaundice. If you cannot get in touch with a GP, call NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service for advice. If you have been diagnosed with Gilbert's syndrome, you do not usually need to get medical advice during an episode of jaundice, unless you have additional or unusual symptoms. Causes of Gilbert's syndrome Gilbert's syndrome is a genetic condition that runs in families. People with the syndrome have a faulty gene, which causes the liver to have problems removing bilirubin from the blood. Normally, when red blood cells reach the end of their life (after about 120 days), haemoglobin, the red pigment that carries oxygen in the blood, breaks down into bilirubin. The liver converts bilirubin into a water-soluble form, which passes into bile (a fluid produced by the liver to help with digestion) and is eventually removed from the body in pee or poo. In Gilbert's syndrome, the faulty gene means bilirubin is not passed into bile at the normal rate. Instead, it builds up in the bloodstream, giving the skin and whites of the eyes a yellowish tinge. Other than inheriting the faulty gene, there are no known risk factors for developing Gilbert's syndrome. It's not related to lifestyle habits, environmental factors or serious underlying liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C. Triggers of jaundice episodes People with Gilbert's syndrome often find there are certain triggers that can bring on an episode of jaundice. Episodes are often linked to things that can cause physical or mental stress including: being dehydrated going without food for long periods of time (fasting) drinking too much alcohol (keep within the recommended weekly units of alcohol) being ill with an infection heavy physical exertion not getting enough sleep having surgery having a period Where possible, avoiding known triggers can reduce your chance of having episodes of jaundice. Who's affected Gilbert's syndrome is common, but it's difficult to know exactly how many people are affected because it does not always cause obvious symptoms. In the UK, it's thought at least 1 in 20 people (probably more) are affected by Gilbert's syndrome. It's more common in people with type 1 diabetes . Gilbert's syndrome affects more men than women. It's usually diagnosed in a person's late teens or early 20s. Diagnosing Gilbert's syndrome Gilbert's syndrome can be diagnosed using a blood test to measure the levels of bilirubin in your blood and a liver function test . When the liver is damaged, it releases enzymes into the blood. At the same time, levels of proteins that the liver produces to keep the body healthy begin to drop. By measuring the levels of these enzymes and proteins, it's possible to build up a reasonably accurate picture of how well the liver is functioning. If the test results show you have high levels of bilirubin in your blood, but your liver is otherwise working normally, a confident diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can usually be made. Sometimes, a genetic test may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. Living with Gilbert's syndrome Gilbert's syndrome is a lifelong condition. But it does not require treatment because it does not pose a threat to health and does not cause complications or an increased risk of liver disease. Episodes of jaundice and any associated symptoms are usually short-lived and eventually pass. Changing your diet or the amount of exercise you do will not affect whether you have the condition. But it's still important to make sure you eat a healthy, balanced diet and get plenty of exercise. You may find it useful to avoid the things you know trigger episodes of jaundice, such as dehydration and stress. If you have Gilbert's syndrome, the problem with your liver may also mean you're at risk of developing jaundice or other side effects after taking certain medicines, such as medicines for high cholesterol like statins . You should talk to a GP before taking any new medicine and make sure you mention that you have Gilbert's syndrome to any doctors treating you for the first time.

For this reason, many people do not realise they have glaucoma, and it's often only picked up during a routine eye test. If you do notice any symptoms, they might include blurred vision, or seeing rainbow-coloured circles around bright lights. Both eyes are usually affected, although it may be worse in 1 eye. Very occasionally, glaucoma can develop suddenly and cause: intense eye pain nausea and vomiting a red eye a headache tenderness around the eyes seeing rings around lights blurred vision When to get medical advice Visit an opticians or a GP if you have any concerns about your vision. If you have glaucoma, early diagnosis and treatment can help stop your vision getting worse. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually lead to blindness . If you develop symptoms of glaucoma suddenly, go to your nearest eye casualty unit or A&E as soon as possible. This is a medical emergency that may require immediate treatment. Types of glaucoma There are several different types of glaucoma. The most common is called primary open angle glaucoma. This tends to develop slowly over many years. It's caused by the drainage channels in the eye becoming gradually clogged over time. Other types of glaucoma include: acute angle closure glaucoma – an uncommon type caused by the drainage in the eye becoming suddenly blocked, which can raise the pressure inside the eye very quickly secondary glaucoma – caused by an underlying eye condition, such as inflammation of the eye (uveitis) childhood glaucoma (congenital glaucoma) – a rare type that occurs in very young children, caused by an abnormality of the eye Causes of glaucoma Glaucoma can occur for a number of reasons. Most cases are caused by a build-up of pressure in the eye when fluid is unable to drain properly. This increase in pressure then damages the nerve that connects the eye to the brain (optic nerve). It's often unclear why this happens, although certain things can increase the risk, including: your age – glaucoma becomes more common as you get older your ethnicity – people of African, Caribbean or Asian origin are at a higher risk your family history – you're more likely to develop glaucoma if you have a parent or sibling with the condition other medical conditions – such as short-sightedness , long-sightedness and diabetes It's not clear whether you can do anything to prevent glaucoma, but having regular eye tests should pick it up as early as possible. Tests for glaucoma Glaucoma can usually be detected during a routine eye test at an opticians, often before it causes any noticeable symptoms. The tests are carried out in the opticians by an optometrist. You should have a routine eye test at least every 2 years. Find out if you're eligible for free NHS eye tests Several quick and painless tests can be carried out to check for glaucoma, including vision tests and measurements of the pressure inside your eye. If tests suggest you have glaucoma, you should be referred to a specialist eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to discuss treatment. Find out how glaucoma is diagnosed Treatments for glaucoma It's not possible to reverse any loss of vision that occurred before glaucoma was diagnosed, but treatment can help stop your vision getting worse. The treatment recommended for you will depend on the type of glaucoma you have, but the options are: eyedrops – to reduce the pressure in your eyes laser treatment – to open up the blocked drainage tubes or reduce the production of fluid in your eyes surgery – to improve the drainage of fluid You'll also probably need regular appointments to monitor your condition and check the treatment is working. Further support for glaucoma The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and Glaucoma UK have more information on glaucoma and offer further support for people affected by glaucoma.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/glomerulonephritis/",
    "text": "Overview - Glomerulonephritis Contents Overview Treatment Glomerulonephritis is damage to the tiny filters inside your kidneys (the glomeruli). It's often caused by your immune system attacking healthy body tissue. If glomerulonephritis is mild, it does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms. It's more likely to be diagnosed when blood or urine tests are carried out for another reason. Although mild cases of glomerulonephritis can be treated effectively, for some people the condition can lead to long-term kidney problems. Symptoms of glomerulonephritis If you have severe glomerulonephritis, your pee may be a dark colour because it contains blood. But the blood in your pee may only be noticed when a sample is tested. Your pee may also be frothy if it contains a large amount of protein. If a lot of protein leaks into your urine, swelling of the legs or other parts of the body can also develop. This is known as nephrotic syndrome. Depending on the cause of glomerulonephritis, other parts of your body can be affected with symptoms such as: rashes joint pain stomach pain high temperature shortness of breath yellowing of the whites of the eyes or the skin, although this may be less noticeable on brown or black skin ( jaundice ) peeing a lot less than usual tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss Some people with glomerulonephritis also have high blood pressure . When to get medical advice See a GP if you notice blood in your urine . This does not always mean you have glomerulonephritis, but the cause should be investigated. Also see a GP if you have other symptoms of glomerulonephritis, such as pain in your joints, tiredness and shortness of breath. If the GP suspects glomerulonephritis, they'll usually arrange: blood tests – to check how much protein is in your blood and measure your creatinine level (creatinine is a waste product produced by your muscles) a urine test – to check for blood or protein in your pee If you do have glomerulonephritis, further blood tests may be needed to help find out the cause. If your kidney problem needs to be investigated further, other tests may be recommended, including: an ultrasound scan – this is to check the size of your kidneys, make sure there are no blockages, and look for any other problems a biopsy – this is to remove a small sample of kidney tissue, carried out using local anaesthetic to numb the area; an ultrasound machine locates your kidneys and a small needle is used to take a sample Causes of glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis often happens if there's a problem with your immune system. It can be caused by inflammatory conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or vasculitis . In some cases, it can be caused by infections, such as: HIV hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocarditis) Some types of cancer and certain medicines can also cause glomerulonephritis. Sometimes it’s not clear what causes it. If you're diagnosed with an inherited type of glomerulonephritis, a doctor can advise you about the chances of someone else in your family being affected. They may recommend screening, which can identify people who may be at increased risk of developing the condition. Treating glomerulonephritis Treatment for glomerulonephritis depends on the cause and severity of your condition. If an underlying condition can be identified, treating it can help. Treatment can be as simple as making changes to your diet, such as eating less salt to reduce the strain on your kidneys. Medicine to lower blood pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, is commonly prescribed because it helps protect the kidneys. If the condition is caused by a problem with your immune system, medicine called immunosuppressants may be used. Read about treating glomerulonephritis Complications of glomerulonephritis Although treatment for glomerulonephritis is effective in many cases, further problems can sometimes develop. These include: high blood pressure high cholesterol blood clots – including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism damage to other organs chronic kidney disease kidney failure If you're diagnosed with glomerulonephritis, a doctor may prescribe medicine to help lower your blood pressure, lower your cholesterol or protect against blood clots.

    "text": "Glue ear Glue ear is where the middle part of the ear canal fills up with fluid. This can cause temporary hearing loss. It usually clears up within 3 months, but see a GP about any hearing problems. Symptoms of glue ear The most common symptom of glue ear is temporary hearing loss. It can affect both ears at the same time. Other symptoms may include: earache or ear pain hearing sounds like ringing or buzzing ( tinnitus ) problems with balance If glue ear lasts a long time, it can affect a child's speech development and progress at school. Glue ear is much more common in children, but adults with glue ear have the same symptoms. Other conditions that cause ear pain Other causes of ear pain Symptoms Possible condition Ear pain with a change in hearing Earwax build-up , an object stuck in the ear (do not try to remove it yourself – see a GP), perforated eardrum (particularly after a loud noise or accident) Ear pain with toothache Baby teething , dental abscess Ear pain with pain when swallowing Sore throat , tonsillitis Ear pain with a high temperature Ear infection , flu , cold Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: Your child has signs of a hearing problem, such as: speaking loudly being difficult to understand asking people to repeat what they say asking for the TV or music to be turned up loud strugglng to hear people far away becoming easily distracted when people are talking finding it hard to concentrate or seeming tired and irritable because it's harder for them to listen What happens at your appointment A GP should be able to tell if it's glue ear by looking for fluid inside the ear. They'll use a small scope with a light and magnifying glass. This should not be painful. If your child has had glue ear for more than 3 months, they may be referred to a specialist for hearing tests . Hearing tests can help find out how severe any hearing loss is and what's causing it. Treatment for glue ear from a GP Glue ear is not always treated. The GP will usually wait to see if the symptoms get better on their own. This is because there's no effective medicine for glue ear, and it often clears up on its own within 3 months. Your child may be monitored for up to a year in case their symptoms change or get worse. The GP may suggest trying a treatment called autoinflation while waiting for symptoms to improve. Autoinflation can help fluid in the ear to drain. It's done by either: blowing up a special balloon using 1 nostril at a time swallowing while holding the nostrils closed As autoinflation has to be done several times a day, it's not usually recommended for children under 3 years old. Antibiotics may be prescribed if glue ear causes an ear infection . Hospital treatment Your child may be referred to a specialist in hospital if: glue ear symptoms are affecting their learning and development they already had severe hearing loss before glue ear they have Down's syndrome or a cleft lip and palate , as glue ear is less likely to get better by itself The 2 main treatments are temporary hearing aids or grommets (small tubes implanted in the ear). Occasionally, surgery may be recommended to remove some glands at the back of the nose (adenoids). This is known as an adenoidectomy . The specialist in hospital will help you decide on the best treatment option. Grommets for glue ear A grommet is a small tube that's placed in your child's ear during surgery. It drains fluid away and keeps the eardrum open. The grommet should fall out naturally within 6 to 12 months as your child's ear gets better. If your child needs grommets, you might find these links useful: Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH): treatment of glue ear with grommets National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS): Harvey gets grommets Video: What is glue ear?

    "title": "Glutaric aciduria type 1",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/glutaric-aciduria/",
    "text": "Glutaric aciduria type 1 Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) is a rare but serious inherited condition. It means the body can't process certain amino acids (\"building blocks\" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with GA1 are unable to break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Normally, these amino acids are broken down into a substance called glutaric acid, which is then converted into energy. Babies with GA1 do not have the enzyme that breaks down glutaric acid, leading to a harmfully high level of this and other substances in the body. Diagnosing GA1 At around 5 days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have GA1. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test. If GA1 is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with GA1 are able to live normal, healthy lives. However, treatment for GA1 must be continued for life. Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma . Some children with untreated GA1 are also at risk of brain damage, which can affect muscle movement. This may lead to problems with walking, talking and swallowing. Symptoms of GA1 Symptoms of GA1 usually don't appear until a few months after birth, although some babies are born with a larger-than-average head (macrocephaly). Children with GA1 may develop some floppiness or weakness in their muscles (hypotonia) during their first year and there's a risk of developing bleeding around their brain ( subdural haematoma ). In rarer cases, bleeding can develop around the back of the eyes (retinal haemorrhage). Metabolic crisis Children with GA1 may have episodes known as a metabolic crisis, sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include: poor feeding or loss of appetite lack of energy abnormal movements vomiting irritability breathing difficulties It's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help recognise the signs. In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps to prevent these symptoms developing. Treating GA1 Diet Children diagnosed with GA1 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids your baby receives, especially lysine and tryptophan. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. People with GA1 may need to follow a restricted protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Medication Your child will be prescribed a medication called L-carnitine, which helps to clear some of the excess glutaric acid. L-carnitine is given as a tablet and needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. Emergency treatment If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold , their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill. Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medication should still be taken as normal. Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn't feeding well while they are ill. Contact the metabolic team at the hospital when your baby becomes unwell, and let them know you have started the emergency diet. If your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds, has a high temperature that does not go down, or their symptoms are getting worse, take your baby straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department . You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven't seen GA1 before. Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein). You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties. How GA1 is inherited The genetic cause (mutation) of GA1 is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition. The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive 2 copies of the affected gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father. If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of GA1. If you're a carrier of the affected gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has: a 25% chance of developing the condition a 50% chance of being a carrier of GA1 a 25% chance of receiving a pair of unaffected genes Although it's not possible to prevent GA1, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about you If you or your child has GA1, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you're finding it hard to breathe Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for a goitre Most goitres are small and do not cause any problems. Sometimes they do not need treatment. You will usually need tests like blood tests and sometimes an ultrasound scan to find out what is causing your goitre. If it is caused by a health condition like an underactive or overactive thyroid, it can usually be treated with medicines. If your goitre is making breathing and swallowing difficult, you may have surgery to remove some or all of your thyroid. Causes of a goitre A goitre happens when your thyroid gland is swollen. Some reasons why your thyroid might be swollen include: an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) harmless lumps (nodules) on the thyroid hormone changes during puberty, pregnancy or the menopause an inflamed thyroid gland ( thyroiditis ) having a condition with your immune system, like Grave's disease not enough iodine in your diet - this is rare in the UK thyroid cancer – this is rare Page last reviewed: 27 July 2022 Next review due: 27 July 2025"

    "text": "Gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) passed on through unprotected sex (sex without a condom). It's treated with antibiotics. If it's not treated, it can cause serious health problems. Symptoms of gonorrhoea Not everyone gets symptoms of gonorrhoea. So it's important to get tested if you think you might have it. If you do get symptoms, they usually start around 2 weeks after infection, although they sometimes do not appear until many months later. Symptoms in women Gonorrhoea can cause symptoms in women. These symptoms can affect anyone with a vagina: a yellow or greenish discharge from your vagina burning pain when you pee pain in your lower abdomen bleeding between your periods (this is rare) Symptoms in men Gonorrhoea can cause symptoms in men. These symptoms can affect anyone with a penis: burning pain when you pee fluid or discharge coming out of your penis sore testicles Gonorrhoea in the anus, throat or eyes Gonorrhoea can affect other parts of your body that come into contact with semen or vaginal fluid. This can cause: pain, itching and discharge from your anus (bottom) a sore throat eye redness, pain and discharge Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if: you or a sexual partner think you might have gonorrhoea you or a sexual partner have had sex without a condom you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant and think you might have gonorrhoea Find a sexual health clinic Self-test kits If you do not have symptoms but want a test, you can use a self-test kit for gonorrhoea at home and send it to a lab to be tested. If the test shows you have gonorrhoea, you'll be contacted and told what to do next. You may be able to get a free self-test kit from: a sexual health clinic some pharmacies You can also buy a self-test kit for gonorrhoea from some pharmacies. Find your local STI testing and treatment service Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You have gonorrhoea (or think you might have it) and: your eyes are red, itchy or painful, or you have pus that sticks to your eyelashes a high temperature (fever) joint pain or swelling a bumpy, spotty or blotchy rash These can be signs of a more serious gonorrhoea infection that needs to be treated quickly. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at your appointment If they think you might have gonorrhoea, the doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and sexual partners. They may need to check your penis or vagina. When you make your appointment, let them know if you’d like someone else to be in the room with you (a chaperone). This could be someone you know, another doctor, nurse or a trained member of staff. They may use a swab (like a large cotton bud) to take a sample of fluid from your penis or vagina. You may be able to do the swab yourself. You might also be asked to give a pee sample. You might have a swab of your bottom (anus), throat or eyes if these areas are affected. You can be tested even if you do not have any symptoms. You may also have tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the same time. Information: Contacting sexual partners If you have gonorrhoea, your current and any recent sexual partners will also need to be tested. A sexual health clinic can help you contact your sexual partners, or they can contact them for you. This can be done without naming you. Treatment for gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea is treated with a single dose of antibiotics, which can be an injection or tablets. You can start treatment before getting your test results. You'll need to go back to the GP surgery or sexual health clinic about a week after starting treatment to be tested again to check you no longer have gonorrhoea. Important Do not have vaginal, anal or oral sex until you and your sexual partner (if you have one) have completed treatment and tests show you no longer have gonorrhoea. Complications of gonorrhoea If gonorrhoea is not treated, it can cause serious problems including: eye infection (gonococcal conjunctivitis) if you touch your eyes after touching infected fluid from your penis or vagina an infection of the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries ( pelvic inflammatory disease ), which can lead to infertility if not treated infection in the testicles or prostate ( prostatitis ) The sooner you get treatment, the easier these complications are to treat. Gonorrhoea in pregnancy Having gonorrhoea during pregnancy can increase your risk of premature birth and your baby having a low birth weight. Theres also a risk the infection could spread to your baby's eyes (gonococcal conjunctivitis) during birth. This can cause blindness if it’s not treated with antibiotics. If you're pregnant and think you might have gonorrhoea, it's important to get tested and treated before your baby is born. How to prevent gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea is spread through vaginal fluid and semen. It can pass from person to person by having vaginal, anal or oral sex without a condom. If you have gonorrhoea when you're pregnant, it can also pass to your baby during birth. There are some things you can do to avoid getting gonorrhoea and spreading it to others. Do use condoms when you have vaginal or anal sex use condoms to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina if you have oral sex get tested once a year, or if you have a new sexual partner complete the full treatment if you or your sexual partner have gonorrhoea Don’t do not share sex toys (if you do, wash and cover them with a new condom before anyone else uses them) Page last reviewed: 16 December 2024 Next review due: 16 December 2027"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/",
    "text": "Gout Gout is a type of arthritis that causes sudden, severe joint pain. Painkillers can help the pain and healthier lifestyle choices can prevent future attacks. Symptoms of gout The main symptoms of gout are: sudden severe pain in a joint – usually your big toe, but it can be in other joints in your feet, ankles, hands, wrists, elbows or knees hot, swollen, red skin over the affected joint – redness may be harder to see on black or brown skin. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of gout for the first time you have gout and your usual treatments are not helping An attack of gout usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks if left untreated. If you do not get treatment, future attacks may last even longer. Leaving gout untreated may cause lasting damage to joints. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You have a sudden pain and swelling in a joint and: the pain is getting worse you also have a very high temperature (you feel hot and shivery) you also feel sick or cannot eat These symptoms could mean you have an infection inside your joint and need urgent medical help. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at your appointment The GP may ask about your diet and if you drink alcohol if you have symptoms of gout. They may also do a test to measure how much uric acid is in your blood. Uric acid is a chemical that can lead to crystals forming around your joints which cause pain. If the test is still unclear, a GP may refer you to see a specialist (rheumatologist) and arrange further tests. This could include taking a sample of fluid from inside the affected joint, using a thin needle. If this test cannot be done or the diagnosis is still unclear, then a scan will be arranged. Treatments for gout Treatment for gout attacks Attacks of gout are usually treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) , like ibuprofen . If the pain and swelling does not improve you may be given steroids as tablets or an injection. Treatment to prevent gout coming back Gout can come back every few months or it may be years. It can come back more often if it's not treated. If you have frequent attacks or high levels of uric acid in your blood, you may need to take uric acid-lowering medicine. Important It's important to take uric acid-lowering medicine regularly, even when you no longer have symptoms. Things you can do to help a gout attack If you're having a gout attack, there are things you can do to relieve the pain: Do take any medicine you've been prescribed as soon as possible – it should start to work within 2 days rest and raise the limb keep the joint cool – apply an ice pack, or a bag of frozen peas, wrapped in a towel for up to 20 minutes at a time drink lots of water (unless a GP tells you not to) try to keep bedclothes off the affected joint at night Don’t do not put pressure on the joint – this can make the pain feel worse Who gets gout Gout is caused by having too much uric acid in your blood. This can lead to crystals forming around your joints, which causes pain. It sometimes runs in families. It's more common in men, especially as they get older. You might have a higher chance of getting gout if you: are overweight drink alcohol have been through the menopause take medicines such as diuretics (water tablets), or medicines for high blood pressure (such as ACE inhibitors) have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, kidney problems, osteoarthritis or diabetes have had surgery or an injury Things that can trigger a gout attack You might get a gout attack if you: have an illness that causes a high temperature drink too much alcohol or eat a very large meal get dehydrated injure a joint take certain medicines Get treatment immediately if you feel an attack starting. Things you can do to help prevent gout coming back Making healthy lifestyle choices may mean you can stop or reduce further gout attacks: Do try to lose weight if you are overweight, but avoid crash diets eat a healthy diet – your doctor may give you a list of foods to include or limit have some alcohol-free days each week – try not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week drink plenty of fluids to avoid getting dehydrated exercise regularly – but avoid intense exercise or putting lots of pressure on joints try to quit smoking ask a GP about vitamin C supplements Don’t do not have lots of sugary drinks and snacks Complications of gout If you get repeated attacks of gout over a long period of time (chronic gout), and are not treated it can lead to: damage in your joints hard lumps, called tophi, under your skin, usually on your ears, fingers or elbows – they can be painful and have an impact on your daily life kidney stones chronic arthritis – but this is rare Page last reviewed: 24 August 2023 Next review due: 24 August 2026"

It sometimes clears up without treatment, but it can take a long time and it may come back. See a GP if you have bumps or lumps on your skin that do not go away in a few weeks. Symptoms of granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare mainly affects children, teenagers and young adults, but older adults can get it too. The most common symptom is small circular patches of pink, purple or skin-coloured bumps on the skin. Credit: ISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/101458/view The patches can appear on 1 or more places on your body. They tend to affect bony areas such as the back of the hands, fingers, elbows and feet. The patches are usually raised and grow slowly to around 2.5 to 5cm. They may eventually become flatter before gradually fading. Granuloma annulare may be harder to see on black and brown skin.

Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have lumps or raised areas of skin that do not go away within a few weeks Treatments for granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare is harmless and sometimes disappears without treatment. But it can take a long time to clear up (2 to 10 years) and it often comes back. A skin specialist (dermatologist) may suggest treatment if granuloma annulare affects a visible or large area of your body and it’s affecting your life. Treatments for granuloma annulare can include: steroid medicines – which may be creams, tablets or injections freezing small areas of skin (cryotherapy) – this can leave a permanent scar ultraviolet light therapy – light is used to reduce the inflammation in the skin skin camouflage (make-up) There are different types of granuloma annulare and some can be difficult to treat. Your doctor will talk to you about your options. Causes of granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare is inflammation in the deep layer of the skin called the dermis. The exact cause is unknown, but some types may be related to other health problems, such as diabetes and thyroid conditions like Graves' disease. You cannot catch granuloma annulare from someone who has it. Page last reviewed: 11 July 2023 Next review due: 11 July 2026 Some images provided by Skin Deep (Don't Forget The Bubbles) ."

    "text": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare condition where blood vessels become inflamed, mainly in the ears, nose, sinuses, kidneys and lungs. It can be serious if not treated but medicines can help manage the symptoms. GPA was previously called Wegener's granulomatosis. Symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a type of vasculitis , which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. Symptoms vary between people, and can be mild or severe. In some people, they come on slowly over many months, and in others they appear suddenly. General symptoms may be mild and start before symptoms in specific parts of the body. They can include: high temperature night sweats feeling weak and tired joint pain loss of appetite weight loss Other symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected, so you may not have all the symptoms. Symptoms that may affect specific parts of the body Body part Possible symptoms Ears, nose and sinuses Ear infection, hearing loss, blocked or runny nose, crusting of blood and mucus in the nose, nosebleeds, sinus pain Eyes Conjunctivitis, swollen eyelids, double vision, blurred vision Lungs A cough that does not go away, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing Kidneys High blood pressure, swelling in the legs, kidney failure Skin Rashes, ulcers, small spots Stomach Tummy pain, diarrhoea, blood in poo Important Some of these symptoms are very common and can be caused by other conditions. Having the symptoms does not definitely mean you have GPA, but it's important to get checked by a GP. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) If you have been diagnosed with GPA, and have new or returning symptoms, see the specialist treating you. Tests for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) There's no single test for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and it can be difficult to diagnose. A GP will ask about your symptoms and may examine the affected part of your body. If they think you could have GPA they'll refer you to a specialist. You'll have tests such as: a blood test to see if you have an antibody called ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), which may be a sign of GPA a biopsy , where a small sample of tissue from any affected body parts is sent for testing an X-ray , CT scan or MRI scan of any affected body parts a urine (pee) test if you have symptoms affecting your kidneys Treatments for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) You'll be treated by a specialist if you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Treatment depends on how severe it is and the body parts affected. There are 2 stages of treatment – bringing the condition under control and keeping it under control. Stage 1: Bringing the condition under control If you have mild GPA, you may be given an anti-inflammatory medicine called a steroid to control your symptoms. You may also have an immunosuppressant medicine such as methotrexate . If you have severe GPA, you may be given a biological medicine such as rituximab or avacopan, or both, along with steroids. You may also be given a type of chemotherapy medicine, such as cyclophosphamide, to bring it under control. Stage 2: Keeping the condition under control Once the condition is under control, treatment aims to stop your symptoms coming back. You may have lower doses of your medicines or take a different type of medicine. Treating symptoms if they come back If your symptoms come back or you get new symptoms (a relapse), your treatment may be changed or restarted. Treating severe cases In very severe cases that affect the kidneys, you may need dialysis or a kidney transplant. You may also need surgery to the affected body part if you have complications from GPA, for example reconstructive surgery if the bridge of the nose has been damaged. Recording information about you and your condition If you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . It's used to help scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Group B strep Group B strep is a type of bacteria called streptococcal bacteria. It's very common in both men and women and usually lives in the bottom (rectum) or vagina. Group B strep is normally harmless and most people will not realise they have it. It's usually only a problem: if you're pregnant – it could spread to your baby in young babies – it can make them very ill if you're older or you're already very ill – it can cause repeated or serious infections This page focuses on group B strep in pregnancy and babies. Group B strep in pregnancy Group B strep is common in pregnancy and rarely causes any problems. It's not routinely tested for, but may be found during tests carried out for another reason, such as a urine test or vaginal swab. Risks in pregnancy If you have group B strep while you're pregnant: your baby will usually be healthy there's a small risk it could spread to your baby during labour and make them ill – this happens in about 1 in 1,750 pregnancies there's an extremely small risk you could miscarry or lose your baby What to do if you're worried If you're worried about group B strep, speak to your midwife or GP for advice. Talk to them about the risks to your baby and ask their advice about whether to get tested. Routine testing is not currently recommended and tests are rarely done on the NHS. This is because group B strep is very common and testing cannot predict whether a baby will get an infection. You can pay for a test privately. Find out more about getting tested for group B strep on the Group B Strep Support website What happens if you have group B strep If tests find group B strep while you're pregnant, or you've had a baby that's been affected by it before, you may need extra care and treatment. You may be advised to: speak to your midwife about your birth plan – they may recommend giving birth in hospital contact your midwife as soon as you go into labour or your waters break have antibiotics into a vein during labour – this can significantly reduce the risk of your baby getting ill stay in hospital for at least 12 hours after giving birth so your baby can be monitored – this is not always necessary Group B strep in babies If you had group B strep during pregnancy, there's a small risk it could spread to your baby and make them very ill. If this happens, it's usually soon after they're born. Your baby may be monitored in hospital for up to 12 hours to check for any problems. They'll be given antibiotics into a vein if they develop symptoms. What to look for after leaving hospital Occasionally, symptoms of a group B strep infection in a baby can develop up to 3 months after birth. Symptoms may include: being floppy or not responding normally grunting when breathing, or working hard to breathe when you look at their chest or stomach very fast or slow breathing an unusually high or low temperature changes in their skin colour or blotchy skin not feeding well or vomiting milk up an unusually fast or slow heart rate Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: your baby has symptoms of a group B strep infection They may need treatment with antibiotics in hospital immediately. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Risks of group B strep in babies Most babies with a group B strep infection make a full recovery if treated. Some babies may develop serious problems like sepsis or meningitis . This can cause lasting problems like hearing loss or loss of vision. Sometimes it can be fatal.

    "text": "Guillain-Barré syndrome Guillain-Barré (pronounced ghee-yan bar-ray) syndrome is a rare condition that affects the nerves. It's serious and needs urgent treatment in hospital. Symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome Guillain-Barré syndrome affects your senses, your movement and things such as breathing and your heartbeat. It usually affects your arms and legs first before you get symptoms in other parts of your body. Symptoms usually get worse over the first 2 to 4 weeks. You might feel tingling, numbness or pins and needles in your feet and hands first. This is usually followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving your joints. Other symptoms can include: sharp, shooting pain (nerve pain), often in your legs or back problems breathing problems with your face, such as drooping face muscles or trouble swallowing or speaking problems with your eyes, such as double vision Some people’s symptoms become so severe that they are not able to move their legs, arms and face ( paralysis ). Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you think you have Guillain-Barré syndrome You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Important Some of the symptoms are common and may be caused by another condition. Having these symptoms does not definitely mean you have Guillain-Barré syndrome. But it's important to get medical help so your symptoms can be checked. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have problems with your face muscles, such as one side of your face drooping (falling lower than the other side) or trouble swallowing you’re not able to lift one or both arms you have trouble speaking, such as slurring your words These could be signs of a stroke and need urgent medical attention. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicine you take with you. How Guillain-Barré syndrome is diagnosed If you have symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome, your GP will check your reflexes and will check for any numbness or weakness in your muscles. If a GP thinks you could have Guillain-Barré syndrome, they'll refer you to a specialist in nerve conditions (neurologist) for tests and treatment. You may have tests such as: an electrical test of your nerves and muscles a breathing test ( spirometry ) blood tests a lumbar puncture , where a sample of fluid is taken from the spine for testing Treatments for Guillain-Barré syndrome If you've been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, you'll be treated in hospital straight away. You'll usually be in hospital for several weeks. Some people may need to stay for several months. Your main treatment will be immunotherapy to stop your immune system from attacking your nerves. You'll either have intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange. You'll also have treatment to help manage your symptoms and monitor your condition. You might need: medicine and compression stockings to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) , if you cannot walk medicines for pain such as gabapentin , carbamazepine or amitriptyline to be on a ventilator, if you have severe breathing problems – this would be in an intensive care unit (ICU) Recovering from Guillain-Barré syndrome You may be in hospital for several months while you have treatment and recover from Guillain-Barré syndrome. Most people will be able to walk within 6 months and will recover within a year. Some people continue to have longer-term problems such as: tingling in the hands and feet sharp, shooting pain (nerve pain) feeling exhausted ( fatigue ) muscle pain and muscle weakness being unable to walk without help anxiety and depression You may be offered: physiotherapy to treat muscle stiffness and help you to move more easily occupational therapy to help you manage everyday tasks and go back to work Your doctor will check you every few months after you recover. You'll then have checks once a year, because some people can become unwell again and need more treatment. Guillain-Barré syndrome can be life-threatening and cannot always be cured. The chance of dying is higher in older people or people who have had severe symptoms. Urgent advice: Contact your specialist straight away if: you have long-term symptoms that are getting worse you've recovered from Guillain-Barré syndrome and you start having symptoms again How you get Guillain-Barré syndrome It's not known what causes Guillain-Barré syndrome, but it's thought to be caused by problems with the immune system. It usually starts within a few weeks of an infection, such as flu or a stomach bug. When you get an infection, your immune system normally attacks and kills the bacteria or virus. But in Guillain-Barré syndrome the immune system starts to attack your nerves. Guillain-Barré syndrome can affect anyone, but it's more common in adults and males. Support if you have Guillain-Barré syndrome Get help from NHS talking therapies Having Guillain-Barré syndrome can affect your mental health. It might help to talk about how you're feeling. You can access talking therapies for free on the NHS. These services can help you find ways to cope. Help is available in person, by video, over the phone or as an online course.

    "text": "Overview - Haemochromatosis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Haemochromatosis is an inherited condition where iron levels in the body slowly build up over many years. This build-up of iron, known as iron overload, can cause unpleasant symptoms. If it is not treated, this can damage parts of the body such as the liver, joints, pancreas and heart. Haemochromatosis most often affects people of white northern European background and is particularly common in countries where lots of people have a Celtic background, such as Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Symptoms of haemochromatosis Symptoms of haemochromatosis usually start between the ages of 30 and 60. Common symptoms include: feeling very tired all the time (fatigue) weight loss weakness joint pain an inability to get or maintain an erection ( erectile dysfunction ) irregular periods or stopped or missed periods Brain fog, mood swings, depression and anxiety Read more about symptoms of haemochromatosis When to see a GP See a GP if you have: persistent or worrying symptoms that could be caused by haemochromatosis – particularly if you have a northern European family background a parent or sibling with haemochromatosis, even if you do not have symptoms yourself – tests can be done to check if you're at risk of developing problems Talk to the GP about whether you should have blood tests to check for haemochromatosis. Read more about tests for haemochromatosis Treatments for haemochromatosis There's currently no cure for haemochromatosis, but there are treatments that can reduce the amount of iron in the body and reduce the risk of damage. There are 2 main treatments. venesection (phlebotomy) – a procedure to remove some of your blood; this may need to be done every week at first and can continue to be needed 2 to 4 times a year for the rest of your life chelation therapy – where you take medicine to reduce the amount of iron in your body; this is only used if it's not easy to regularly remove some of your blood You do not need to make any big changes to your diet to control your iron levels if you're having treatment, but you'll usually be advised to avoid: breakfast cereals containing added iron iron or vitamin C supplements drinking too much alcohol Read more about how haemochromatosis is treated Causes of haemochromatosis Haemochromatosis is caused by a faulty gene that affects how the body absorbs iron from your diet. You're at risk of developing the condition if both of your parents have this faulty gene and you inherit 1 copy from each of them. You will not get haemochromatosis if you only inherit 1 copy of the faulty gene but there's a chance you could pass the faulty gene on to any children you have. If you do inherit 2 copies, you will not necessarily get haemochromatosis. Only a small number of people with 2 copies of this faulty gene will ever develop the condition. It's not known exactly why this is. Read more about the causes of haemochromatosis Complications of haemochromatosis If the condition is diagnosed and treated early on, haemochromatosis does not affect life expectancy and is unlikely to result in serious problems. But if it's not found until it's more advanced, the high iron levels can damage parts of the body. This can lead to potentially serious complications, such as: liver problems – including scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ) or liver cancer diabetes – where the level of sugar in the blood becomes too high arthritis – pain and swelling in the joints heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly Read more about complications of haemochromatosis Further support Haemochromatosis UK is a patient-run UK charity that provides information and support to people living with haemochromatosis.

    "text": "Haemophilia Haemophilia is a rare condition that affects the way your blood clots, meaning you bleed more easily than other people. It cannot usually be cured, but treatment can help control your symptoms. Symptoms of haemophilia Symptoms of haemophilia include: bleeding for a long time after an injury, surgery, or having a tooth removed bruising easily joint pain, stiffness and swelling Symptoms of haemophilia usually begin in early childhood, but sometimes symptoms may not be noticed until later. Information: Other conditions can cause similar symptoms to haemophilia, such as von Willebrand disease . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child have symptoms of haemophilia you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy and someone in you or your partner's family has haemophilia Causes of haemophilia Haemophilia is caused by a lack of a protein, called clotting factor, that helps blood clot. Most people with haemophilia are born with it. It is possible to develop haemophilia later in life (acquired haemophilia), but this is very rare. How haemophilia is passed on Haemophilia is usually caused by an altered gene being passed on to a child by their parents (inherited). Men with the altered gene will have symptoms of haemophilia. Women with the altered gene (carriers of haemophilia) can have symptoms of haemophilia, but this is less common and the symptoms are less severe than in men. Information: Find out more The Haemophilia Society: what causes haemophilia? Types of haemophilia There are different types of haemophilia. The type you have depends on the type and amount of clotting factor protein in your blood. The main types of haemophilia are: haemophilia A – caused by a lack of clotting factor 8 (factor VIII) haemophilia B – caused by a lack of clotting factor 9 (factor IX) Haemophilia A and B have the same symptoms, but the medicines used to treat each type are different. Haemophilia can be mild, moderate or severe. The less clotting factor you have, the more severe your symptoms will be. People with severe haemophilia need more treatment and are at more risk of life-threatening bleeding. How haemophilia is diagnosed If a GP thinks you might have haemophilia, you will have a blood test to check the amount of clotting factor in your blood. If you or your child are diagnosed with haemophilia, you'll be referred to your local haemophilia centre for treatment. Diagnosing haemophilia in pregnancy If you're at risk of having a child with haemophilia, a GP may refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss the risks and options. Tests are available before, during and after pregnancy for you and your baby. These tests may include: a genetic test to check if you carry the altered gene a blood test during early pregnancy to check the sex of the baby – boys are at more risk of haemophilia chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis tests during pregnancy to check if your baby has haemophilia a blood test from your baby after birth to check if they have haemophilia Information: Find out more The Haemophilia Society: support for people newly diagnosed with haemophilia The Haemophilia Society: pregnancy and childbirth Treatment for haemophilia Haemophilia is usually treated with injections of clotting factor to replace the missing clotting factor in your blood. It can also be treated with other medicines including emicizumab, desmopressin and tranexamic acid . Haemophilia is treated in 2 main ways: If you have severe haemophilia, you'll usually need injections up to 3 times a week to prevent bleeding (preventative or prophylactic treatment). You can usually do these injections yourself at home. If you have mild or moderate haemophilia, you'll usually only need treatment to stop or reduce bleeding after it starts (on-demand treatment). You may also need treatment before having surgery or dental work. Some people develop antibodies to clotting factor, called inhibitors, which make this treatment less effective. If this happens, your haemophilia team will work with you to find you a more suitable treatment. Information: The clotting factor used to treat haemophilia today is very safe. Much of it's synthetic and has no risk of infection. When it's made from donated blood, it's tested and treated to make sure it's as safe as possible, and the risk of getting an infection from it is very low. Managing bleeding yourself Your haemophilia team will usually show you how to treat bleeding yourself at home, with clotting factor injections or other medicines. If you can, treat any bleeding, including bleeding into joints or muscles, as soon as possible. This will reduce pain, recovery time and the risk of permanent damage. When recovering from a joint or muscle bleed, following the PRICE steps for sprains and strains can aid your recovery. For most bleeding you will also need to get medical help. Information: Find out more The Haemophilia Society: treating and managing a bleed Information: Blood transfusions before 1996 If you received a blood transfusion before 1996, there's a chance you may have been given infected blood. This could mean you were infected with hepatitis C. If you had a blood transfusion before 1996 and you've not been tested for hepatitis C, contact the specialist looking after your care to discuss any tests you may need. Find out more about support for people who may have been affected by infected blood .

    "text": "Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections. Babies and children are most at risk of getting seriously ill and can get vaccinated against it. Complications of Hib infection A Hib infection can cause serious conditions including: infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ) a severe immune reaction ( sepsis ) infection of part of your windpipe ( epiglottitis ) infection of the lungs ( pneumonia ) You can become very ill with these conditions and will need treatment in hospital. Even with successful treatment, there may be lasting effects such as hearing loss, seizures, loss of limbs and learning disabilities . Symptoms of a Hib infection Symptoms of Hib infection depend on what part of the body is affected. Symptoms may include: a high temperature difficulty breathing – babies may make grunting noises being sleepier than normal or difficult to wake blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin this may be noticeable under the nails or around the eyes a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin and does not disappear when you press a glass against it a headache a sore throat swollen or painful joints Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if you, your child or someone else: have severe difficulty breathing have blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the lips, tongue, gums and under the nails or around the eyes have a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin and does not fade when you press a glass against it have a seizure (a fit) is not responding normally If you or someone you look after has any of these symptoms, call 999 or go to A&E. Trust your instincts. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Urgent advice: Call 111 now if you, your child or someone else: have difficulty breathing feels very unwell or feels there's something seriously wrong have dark yellow or brown pee or peeing less than normal, for example, your baby has fewer wet nappies keep being sick and cannot keep any food down (or milk for babies and young children) has a high or low temperature, feels hot or cold to touch, or is shivering Do not worry if you're not sure, it's still best to call 111. They can tell you what to do, get a nurse or doctor to call you, or call you an ambulance. Treatment for Hib infection The main treatment for a Hib infection is antibiotics. You'll usually need to be treated in hospital. You may be given oxygen and other medicines such as steroids , depending on your symptoms. Other treatments, including surgery, may also be needed. If you have a Hib infection, your close contacts, such as anyone you live with, may be offered antibiotics to stop them getting ill. Hib vaccination Vaccination is the best way to prevent serious Hib infections. Vaccines that protect against Hib are offered to babies as part of the NHS vaccination schedule . There are 2 vaccines that protect against Hib: 6-in-1 vaccine – given in 3 doses at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old Hib/Men C vaccine – a booster vaccine given at 1 year old If your child was not vaccinated as a baby, you can ask your GP about how they can get it. How Hib spreads Hib is spread by sneezing and coughing, the same as how colds and flu spread. Hib bacteria can live in the nose and throat of many healthy people without causing any problems. But healthy people can still pass it on and cause others to get ill. Some people are more at risk of getting seriously ill from a Hib infection, including: babies and young children people with a weakened immune system, including people who have had their spleen removed older people Page last reviewed: 04 April 2023 Next review due: 04 April 2026"

    "title": "Hair dye reactions",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hair-dye-reactions/",
    "text": "Hair dye reactions Many hair dyes contain ingredients that can irritate your skin or cause an allergic reaction. It's important to be aware of this risk, and know what to do. Reactions to hair dye are avoidable if you follow some simple safety advice. This page offers advice to anyone who uses permanent or semi-permanent hair dye, especially darker-coloured dyes. Why some people are sensitive to hair dye Some people are prone to a skin reaction called contact dermatitis . This means their skin may become red, dry, scaly, bumpy, blistered, or irritated (inflamed) when they come into contact with a particular substance. The substance may either be an irritant, directly damaging the skin, or an allergen, triggering an allergic reaction that affects the skin. Many permanent and some semi-permanent hair dyes contain a chemical called paraphenylenediamine (PPD), which is a known irritant and allergen. Darker coloured dyes contain higher level of PPD. PPD is the cause of most reactions to hair dye. Is PPD safe? Hair dyes containing PPD are safe to use, providing safety instructions are followed. These products are strictly regulated and there's a maximum limit to the amount of PPD the product can contain. If you ignore the safety instructions that come with the dye, you could put yourself at risk of a serious reaction. You're particularly at risk if you have (or have previously had) a black henna tattoo. These temporary tattoos should be avoided because the paste often contains high levels of PPD, which can increase the risk of an allergic reaction the next time you're exposed to it. So, you could develop a life-threatening allergic reaction when you next use PPD hair dye. Learn more about the dangers of black henna tattoos on the British Skin Foundation website. How to avoid a reaction to hair dye Patch test Always carry out a patch test before using a permanent or semi-permanent hair dye, even if you are using your regular brand. This usually involves dabbing a small amount of the dye solution behind your ear or on your inner elbow and leaving it to dry. Follow the instructions that come with the dye. If you develop any irritation or feel unwell after the patch test, do not use the product. Allergy clinic You could also have a patch test done at an allergy clinic, to see which chemicals you're sensitive to, if any. You can then check product labels and avoid products containing these chemicals. However, the clinic may not test all hair dye chemicals. Other precautions If you do not develop any reaction from the patch test, you can continue to use the dye, but make sure you: do not leave it on for longer than the recommended time wear gloves when applying the dye rinse your hair thoroughly afterwards carefully follow the instructions included Signs and symptoms of a hair dye reaction Reactions to PPD can range from mild irritation in the scalp to an allergic reaction that can potentially trigger serious symptoms throughout the body. Mild irritation If you're mildly irritated by PPD, you may find that your scalp, neck, forehead, ears or eyelids become irritated and inflamed after using hair dye. The skin exposed to the PPD may become red, swollen, blistered, dry, thickened and cracked. You may feel a burning or stinging sensation. Symptoms will usually appear within 48 hours, although strong irritants may cause your skin to react immediately. Learn more about irritant contact dermatitis . Allergic reaction If you're allergic to PPD, your scalp and face may feel itchy and start to swell. PPD may also trigger symptoms throughout your body, such as itching, a nettle rash and generally feeling ill. These symptoms may not develop until hours, or even days, later. A severe allergic reaction that develops within minutes is called anaphylaxis , or \"anaphylactic shock\". Signs of anaphylaxis include: itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet – the eyelids can swell so much that the eyes close feeling lightheaded or faint swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties wheezing tummy pain, nausea and vomiting collapsing and becoming unconscious What to do if you have a reaction Dial 999 for an ambulance if you think you or someone you’re with is having a severe allergic reaction. Give an adrenaline injection if you have one. If you think you're experiencing a reaction to hair dye but it's not an emergency, follow this advice: Relieving mild symptoms wash your hair and scalp thoroughly with mild shampoo to remove any excess dye try gently applying an emollient (moisturising treatment) such as petroleum jelly to the affected skin Steroid cream If your skin is very red, sore and inflamed, you may need to try a steroid cream (topical corticosteroid) . You can buy a mild steroid cream at a pharmacy or a GP may prescribe it. Read more about the treatment of contact dermatitis . Antihistamine medicines Medicines called antihistamines can help reduce skin inflammation and itching. A pharmacist or GP will be able to recommend an antihistamine for you. Avoiding products with PPD If you develop a reaction to hair dye, even just a mild one, you should stop using products containing PPD altogether, as there's a risk you could develop a more severe reaction in the future. Try switching to a safer alternative, such as a non-permanent, PPD-free hair dye – but be aware that it's still possible to develop a reaction to this.

    "title": "Hamstring injury",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hamstring-injury/",
    "text": "Hamstring injury A hamstring injury is a strain or tear to the tendons or large muscles at the back of the thigh. It's a common injury in athletes and can happen in different severities. The 3 grades of hamstring injury are: grade 1 – a mild muscle pull or strain grade 2 – a partial muscle tear grade 3 – a complete muscle tear The length of time it takes to recover from a hamstring strain or tear will depend on how severe the injury is. A minor muscle pull or strain (grade 1) may take a few days to heal, whereas it could take weeks or months to recover from a muscle tear (grade 2 or 3). The hamstrings The hamstrings are tendons (strong bands of tissue) at the back of the thighs that attach the large thigh muscle to the bone. The term \"hamstring\" also refers to the group of 3 muscles that run along the back of your thigh, from your hip to just below your knee. The hamstring muscles are not used much while standing or walking, but they're very active during activities that involve bending the knee, such as running, jumping and climbing. What causes hamstring injuries? A hamstring injury often happens during sudden, powerful movements, such as sprinting, lunging or jumping that overstretch your tendons or muscles. The injury can also happen gradually during slower movements. Recurring injury is common in athletes and sportsmen, as you're more likely to injure your hamstring if you've injured it before. Regularly doing stretching and strengthening exercises, and warming up before exercise, may help reduce the risk of injuring your hamstring. How do I know if I've injured my hamstring? Mild hamstring strains (grade 1) will usually cause sudden pain and tenderness at the back of your thigh. It may be painful to move your leg, but the strength of the muscle should not be affected. Partial hamstring tears (grade 2) are usually more painful and tender. There may also be some swelling and bruising at the back of your thigh and you may have lost some strength in your leg. Severe hamstring tears (grade 3) will usually be very painful, tender, swollen and bruised, making it difficult to walk and stand. There may have been a \"popping\" sensation at the time of the injury and you'll be unable to use the affected leg. When to see a GP Most hamstring injuries can be cared for at home. See a GP if you have any concerns about your injury, particularly if you think it's a severe injury, it's not healing, or your symptoms are getting worse. The GP can also advise you about when you can return to your normal activities and what exercises you should do to aid your recovery in the meantime. They may also refer you for a scan or to a physiotherapist for specialist treatment in some cases. Rest and recovery from a hamstring injury Recovering from a hamstring injury may take days, weeks or months, depending on how severe it is. A completely torn hamstring may take several months to heal and you'll be unable to resume training or play sport during this time. Initial treatment During the first 2 or 3 days, you should care for your injury using RICE therapy: Rest – rest your leg as much as possible. Ice – apply cold packs (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work) to your hamstring for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours during the day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. Compression – compress or bandage the thigh to limit any swelling and movement that could cause further damage. You can use a simple elastic bandage or elasticated tubular bandage available from a pharmacy. Elevation – keep your leg raised and supported on a pillow as much as possible, to help reduce any swelling. Regular painkillers, such as paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) cream or gel, may also help relieve the pain. Short-term use of oral NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen tablets, can also help reduce swelling and inflammation. However, these are not suitable for everyone. Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if you can take it. The GP may recommend you wear a knee splint for a brief time. This will help stop your leg moving to help it heal. Gentle exercises and stretches Returning to strenuous exercise too quickly could make your injury worse, but avoiding exercise for too long can cause your hamstring muscles to shrink and scar tissue to form around the tear. To avoid this, you should start doing gentle hamstring stretches after a few days, when the pain has started to subside. This should be followed by a programme of gentle exercise, such as walking and cycling , and hamstring strengthening exercises. The GP can give you further advice and, if necessary, refer you to a physiotherapist for a suitable exercise programme. To avoid injuring yourself again, you should only return to a full level of activity when your hamstring muscles are strong enough. Your physiotherapist or GP will be able to advise you about this. Many people need to avoid sports for at least a few weeks, but the length of time you need off will depend on the severity of your injury. Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have a hamstring injury, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS treatment for a hamstring injury near you Page last reviewed: 03 November 2021 Next review due: 03 November 2024"

They can tell you which ones are suitable for children. Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease do not improve after 7 to 10 days you're pregnant and get hand, foot and mouth disease Hand, foot and mouth disease can be spread to other people. Check with your GP surgery before going. They may suggest a phone consultation. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you or your child has a very high temperature, or feel hot and shivery you're worried about your child's hand, foot and mouth disease symptoms your child has hand, foot and mouth disease and is peeing less than usual (they may be becoming dehydrated) You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . How to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading Hand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It's spread in coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in the blisters. You can get it more than once. You can start spreading it from a few days before you have any symptoms, but you're most likely to spread it to others in the first 5 days after symptoms start. To reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease: wash your hands often with soap and water, and children's hands too use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze bin used tissues as quickly as possible do not share towels or household items like cups or cutlery wash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash Staying off school or nursery Keep your child off school or nursery while they're feeling too unwell to go. But as soon as they're feeling better, they can go back to school or nursery. There's no need to wait until all the blisters have healed. Keeping your child away from other children for longer is unlikely to stop the illness spreading. Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy Although there's usually no risk to the pregnancy or baby, it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and mouth disease. This is because getting hand, foot and mouth disease shortly before giving birth can mean your baby is born with a mild version of it. Speak to a GP or your midwife if you have been in contact with someone with hand, foot and mouth disease. Page last reviewed: 10 May 2024 Next review due: 10 May 2027"

You do not need to wash your laundry on a hot wash. Wet combing Lice and nits can be removed by wet combing. You can buy a special fine-toothed comb (detection comb) online or from pharmacies to remove head lice and nits. There may be instructions on the pack, but usually you: wash hair with ordinary shampoo apply lots of conditioner (any conditioner will do) comb the whole head of hair, using the detection comb, from the roots to the ends It usually takes about 10 minutes to comb short hair, and 20 to 30 minutes for long, frizzy or curly hair. When you've finished combing the hair, comb through all the hair again for a second time. Do wet combing on days 1, 5, 9 and 13 to catch any newly hatched head lice. Check again that everyone's hair is free of lice on day 17. Medicated lotions and sprays If wet combing has not worked or is not suitable, you could try a medicated lotion or spray. These kill head lice in all types of hair, and you can buy them from pharmacies, supermarkets or online. Head lice should die within a day. Some lotions and sprays come with a comb to remove dead lice and eggs. Some treatments need to be repeated after a week to kill any newly hatched lice. Check the pack to see if they're OK for you or your child to use, and how to use them. If lotions or sprays do not work, speak to a pharmacist about other treatments. Treatments that are not recommended for head lice Some treatments are not recommended because they're unlikely to work. For example: products containing permethrin head lice \"repellents\" electric combs for head lice plant oil treatments, such as tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil and lavender oil herbal remedies Information: Wet combing video The charity Community Hygiene Concern has a video about wet combing for head lice . You cannot prevent head lice There's nothing you can do to prevent head lice. You can help stop them spreading by wet combing regularly, using a detection comb, to catch them early. Do not use medicated lotions and sprays to prevent head lice. They can irritate the scalp. Page last reviewed: 22 April 2024 Next review due: 22 April 2027"

    "title": "Overview-Heart attack",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/",
    "text": "Overview - Heart attack Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Recovery Complications Prevention A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot. A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack. A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening. Symptoms of a heart attack Symptoms of a heart attack can include: chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy feeling lightheaded or dizzy sweating shortness of breath feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack) coughing or wheezing The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion. While the most common symptom is chest pain, symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain. Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances. Treating heart attacks While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin. Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart. In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on the type of heart attack, and how serious it is. The 2 main treatments are: using medicines to dissolve blood clots surgery to help restore blood to the heart Causes of a heart attack Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks. CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels (coronary arteries) that supply the heart muscle become clogged by a build-up of deposits of fatty substances, known as plaques. Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture. The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack. Recovering from a heart attack The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle. Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do. The recovery process aims to: reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins ), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities ( cardiac rehabilitation ) Find out more about recovering from a heart attack Complications of a heart attack Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening. These include: arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. Some types can stop the heart beating cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture) These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death. Some people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack. But with treatment many people survive a heart attack. The outlook often depends on: age – serious complications are more likely as you get older the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible general health Find out more about complications of a heart attack Preventing a heart attack There are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack): smokers should quit smoking lose weight if you're overweight or obese do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day moderate your alcohol consumption Video: heart attack This video explores the symptoms, surgical treatments and importance of reducing risk factors for a heart attack.

Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. How heart block is diagnosed The main test used to diagnose heart block is an electrocardiogram (ECG) , which measures the electrical activity of your heart. It usually only takes a few minutes, but you may be asked to wear a portable ECG for 1 or 2 days to monitor your heart. Other tests that may be used to help diagnose heart block include: an echocardiogram or MRI scan – to get a picture of your heart and the nearby blood vessels exercise tests – to check your heart while you use a bike or treadmill blood tests Types of heart block The most common type of heart block is called AV (atrioventricular) heart block. AV heart block may be diagnosed as: 1st-degree – which does not usually need treatment 2nd-degree – which sometimes needs treatment 3rd-degree (complete) – which often needs treatment There are other types of heart block which affect different areas of the heart, but the symptoms are often similar. Find out more about different types of heart block on the British Heart Foundation website . Treatments for heart block The treatment for heart block depends on what's causing it and whether you have any symptoms. If you have heart block that is not causing any symptoms, you will not usually need any treatment. If you have severe symptoms, you may need a pacemaker , which keeps your heart beating regularly and not too slowly. You may need a pacemaker for a short time or permanently, depending on what's causing your heart block. Causes of heart block Heart block is most often caused by a heart condition such as coronary heart disease, or a heart attack. Sometimes babies are born with heart block, known as congenital heart block. Other possible causes of AV heart block include: taking some types of medicine infection and inflammation of the heart, caused by another condition having heart surgery Sometimes there's no obvious cause. Help and support for heart block If you're diagnosed with heart block, you can get advice and support from your GP or other healthcare professionals. You can also get information and support from the British Heart Foundation.

    "text": "Overview - Coronary heart disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Recovery Prevention Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death in the UK and worldwide. CHD is sometimes called ischaemic heart disease or coronary artery disease. Symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD) The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are: chest pain (angina) shortness of breath pain in your neck, shoulders, jaw or arms feeling faint feeling sick (nausea) But not everyone has the same symptoms and some people may not have any before coronary heart disease is diagnosed. Causes of coronary heart disease (CHD) Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. Over time, the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma. Atherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors, such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. You're also more at risk of getting atherosclerosis if you have conditions like high cholesterol , high blood pressure (hypertension) or diabetes . Diagnosing coronary heart disease (CHD) If a doctor feels you're at risk of coronary heart disease, they may carry out a risk assessment. They'll ask you about your medical and family history and your lifestyle, and they'll take a blood test . Further tests may be needed to confirm coronary heart disease, including: electrocardiogram (ECG) echocardiogram chest x-ray coronary angiogram Read more about how coronary heart disease is diagnosed . Treating coronary heart disease (CHD) Coronary heart disease cannot be cured but treatment can help manage the symptoms and reduce the chances of problems such as heart attacks. Treatment can include: lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and stopping smoking medicines angioplasty – where balloons and stents are used to treat narrow heart arteries surgery Recovering from the effects of coronary heart disease (CHD) If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty, or heart surgery, you’ll want to get back to as full a life as possible. Advice and support is available to help you deal with aspects of your life that may have been affected by coronary heart disease. Read more about recovering from the effects of coronary heart disease . Preventing coronary heart disease (CHD) You can reduce your risk of getting coronary heart disease by making some simple lifestyle changes. These include: eating a healthy, balanced diet being physically active giving up smoking controlling blood cholesterol and sugar levels Keeping your heart healthy will also have other health benefits, such as helping reduce your risk of stroke and dementia . The heart The heart is a muscle about the size of your fist. It pumps blood around your body and beats approximately 70 times a minute. After the blood leaves the right side of the heart, it goes to your lungs where it picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood returns to your heart and is then pumped to the body's organs through a network of arteries. The blood returns to your heart through veins before being pumped back to your lungs again. This process is called circulation. The heart gets its own supply of blood from a network of blood vessels on the heart's surface called coronary arteries. Video: coronary arteries and heart disease This video shows how your heart works and what happens when your coronary arteries stop functioning properly.

    "text": "Overview - Heart failure Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Living with Heart failure means that the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly. It usually happens because the heart has become too weak or stiff. It's sometimes called congestive heart failure, although this name is not widely used now. Heart failure does not mean your heart has stopped working. It means it needs some support to help it work better. It can occur at any age, but is most common in older people. Heart failure is a long-term condition that tends to get gradually worse over time. It cannot usually be cured, but the symptoms can often be controlled for many years. Symptoms of heart failure The main symptoms of heart failure are: breathlessness after activity or at rest feeling tired most of the time and finding exercise exhausting feeling lightheaded or fainting swollen ankles and legs Some people also experience other symptoms, such as a persistent cough, a fast heart rate and dizziness . Symptoms can develop quickly (acute heart failure) or gradually over weeks or months (chronic heart failure). When to get medical advice See a GP if you experience persistent or gradually worsening symptoms of heart failure. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest A&E department as soon as possible if you have sudden or very severe symptoms. A number of tests can be used to help check how well your heart is working, including blood tests , an ECG and an echocardiogram . Find out more about how heart failure is diagnosed Causes of heart failure Heart failure is often the result of a number of problems affecting the heart at the same time. Conditions that can lead to heart failure include: coronary heart disease – where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged up with fatty substances ( atherosclerosis ), which may cause angina or a heart attack high blood pressure – this can put extra strain on the heart, which over time can lead to heart failure conditions affecting the heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ) heart rhythm problems ( arrhythmias ), such as atrial fibrillation damage or other problems with the heart valves congenital heart disease – birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart Sometimes obesity , anaemia , drinking too much alcohol, an overactive thyroid or high pressure in the lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) can also lead to heart failure. Treatments for heart failure Treatment for heart failure usually aims to control the symptoms for as long as possible and slow down the progression of the condition. How you're treated will depend on what is causing your heart failure. Common treatments include: lifestyle changes – including eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking medicine – a range of medicines can help; many people need to take 2 or 3 different types devices implanted in your chest – these can help control your heart rhythm surgery – such as a bypass operation or a heart transplant Treatment will usually be needed for life. A cure may be possible when heart failure has a treatable cause. For example, if your heart valves are damaged, replacing or repairing them may cure the condition. Outlook for heart failure Heart failure is a serious long-term condition that will usually continue to get slowly worse over time. It can severely limit the activities you're able to do and is often eventually fatal. But it's very difficult to tell how the condition will progress on an individual basis. It's very unpredictable. Lots of people remain stable for many years, while in some cases it may get worse quickly.

    "text": "Heart valve disease Heart valve disease is where 1 or more of the valves in your heart does not work as it should. It does not always need treatment, but some people will need medicines or surgery. Symptoms of heart valve disease Symptoms of heart valve disease can include: shortness of breath feeling tired or weak feeling dizzy heart palpitations , where you suddenly feel your heart beating irregularly or faster than usual swollen ankles and feet chest pain or discomfort Some people do not have any symptoms. Sometimes it's found by chance if a doctor hears an unusual sound (a heart murmur) when they listen to your chest. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you're feeling short of breath regularly you feel tired, weak or dizzy when doing normal activities you have heart palpitations that keep coming back, last longer than a few minutes or are getting worse you have swollen ankles or feet you have chest pain that comes and goes These symptoms can be caused by many different conditions. Having them does not definitely mean you have heart valve disease. But it's important to get them checked by a GP. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you're struggling to breathe – you're choking, gasping and unable to speak you have sudden chest pain that spreads to your arms, back, neck or jaw, or lasts more than 15 minutes you have chest pain with shortness of breath or heart palpitations Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. How heart valve disease is diagnosed If you have symptoms of heart valve disease a GP will listen to your heart. They may arrange tests or refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist). Tests you may have include: an ultrasound scan of your heart ( echocardiogram ) an X-ray of your chest an electrocardiogram (ECG) , where sensors are put on your chest to check your heart Treatments for heart valve disease If you have mild heart valve disease and you do not have any symptoms, you may not need treatment. You'll usually have regular check-ups to see if your condition is getting worse. If you have symptoms or have severe heart valve disease, you may need medicines to: lower your blood pressure and help protect your heart (ACE inhibitors) reduce build-up of fluid in your body and lungs (diuretics) slow down your heart rate (such as beta blockers ) reduce the risk of blood clots ( anticoagulants ) If you have severe heart valve disease you'll usually need surgery to either: repair the heart valve, if it's not seriously damaged replace the heart valve with an artificial valve or one made from human or animal tissue, if it cannot be repaired Information: Find out more about heart valve surgery Aortic valve replacement British Heart Foundation: heart valve repair surgery Complications of heart valve disease Heart valve disease affects people differently. It's common to have mild heart valve disease that does not cause any issues, but for some people it can lead to serious health problems. Your care team will tell you what to expect. They'll also advise on any changes you need to make. This can include healthy lifestyle changes and avoiding strenuous exercise. Possible complications of heart valve disease include: heart failure , where your heart cannot pump blood properly atrial fibrillation , where your heart beats irregularly and faster than normal a stroke endocarditis , a serious condition where your heart becomes infected Heart valve disease in pregnancy It's important to get advice from a heart specialist if you're pregnant or want to get pregnant. Pregnancy can make heart valve disease symptoms worse. You can usually have a safe pregnancy, but you may need extra monitoring and treatment. Types of heart valve disease Heart valve disease happens when 1 of your heart valves either: does not open fully (called stenosis) does not close fully (called prolapse) and may be leaky (called regurgitation) This means your heart has to work harder to pump blood around your body. It can affect any of your 4 heart valves, but it's most common in the aortic or mitral valves, on the left side of your heart. Less commonly it can affect the tricuspid or pulmonary valves, on the right side of your heart. Causes of heart valve disease Heart valve disease can be caused by: congenital heart disease , where you're born with the condition changes to your heart as you get older, particularly if you smoke or have high blood pressure or high cholesterol conditions that affect your heart, such as rheumatic fever , cardiomyopathy or endocarditis damage from a heart attack Help and support for heart valve disease If you have heart valve disease you can get support from charities such as: the British Heart Foundation Heart Valve Voice Page last reviewed: 22 January 2025 Next review due: 22 January 2028"

    "text": "Heartburn and acid reflux Heartburn is a burning feeling in the chest caused by stomach acid travelling up towards the throat (acid reflux). If it keeps happening, it may be called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Symptoms of acid reflux The main symptoms of acid reflux are: heartburn – a burning sensation in the middle of your chest an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, caused by stomach acid You may also have: a cough or hiccups that keep coming back a hoarse voice bad breath bloating and feeling sick Symptoms are often worse after eating, when lying down and when bending over. Causes of heartburn and acid reflux Lots of people get heartburn from time to time. There's often no obvious reason why. Sometimes it's caused or made worse by: certain food and drink – such as coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate and fatty or spicy foods being overweight smoking pregnancy - find out more about indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy stress and anxiety an increase in some types of hormones, such as progesterone and oestrogen some medicines, such as anti-inflammatory painkillers (like ibuprofen ) a hiatus hernia – when part of your stomach moves up into your chest a stomach ulcer a bacterial infection in your stomach How you can ease heartburn and acid reflux yourself Simple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce heartburn. Do eat smaller, more frequent meals try to lose weight if you're overweight try to find ways to relax Don’t do not have food or drink that triggers your symptoms do not eat within 3 or 4 hours before bed do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist do not smoke do not drink too much alcohol do not stop taking any prescribed medicine without speaking to a doctor first You may find that using wood, bricks or books to raise the head of your bed by around 10 to 20cm, so your chest and head are above your waist, helps relieve symptoms. This can help stop stomach acid travelling up towards your throat. But do not try to achieve the same effect by using additional pillows, as this can increase pressure on your belly and make your symptoms worse. A pharmacist can help with heartburn and acid reflux Speak to a pharmacist for advice if you keep getting heartburn. They may recommend medicines called antacids or alginates that can help ease your symptoms. It's best to take these with food or soon after eating, as this is when you're most likely to get heartburn. They may also work for longer if taken with food. Although antacids and alginates help symptoms in the short term, they will not cure the problem and should not be taken regularly for long periods. If you're pregnant, a pharmacist can advise you about medicines you can take. Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: lifestyle changes and pharmacy medicines are not helping your heartburn you have heartburn most days you also have other symptoms, like food getting stuck in your throat, frequently being sick, or losing weight for no reason A GP can provide alternative or stronger treatments and help rule out any more serious causes of your symptoms. If at any time you feel your symptoms are getting worse, contact a GP, go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111. Treatment for heartburn and acid reflux from a GP If you have acid reflux, a GP may prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces how much acid your stomach makes. PPIs include: omeprazole lansoprazole You'll usually need to take this type of medicine for 4 or 8 weeks, depending on how serious your acid reflux is. Go back to the GP if your symptoms return after stopping your medicine. You may need a long-term prescription. Important If a PPI does not help, your doctor may suggest trying a different type of medicine called an H2 receptor antagonist, such as famotidine. Tests and treatments for severe heartburn and acid reflux If medicines do not help or your symptoms are severe, a GP may refer you to a specialist for: tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, such as a gastroscopy (where a thin tube with a camera inside it is passed down your throat and into your stomach) tests to check for bacteria that can cause heartburn – this can be treated with a combination of antibiotics and PPIs surgery on your stomach or food pipe (oesophagus) to stop acid reflux Page last reviewed: 20 November 2023 Next review due: 20 November 2026"

Treatment in hospital You may need to go into hospital if HSP affects your kidneys. In hospital, you may be given strong medicines like steroids to help ease your symptoms. Risks of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) Most people with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) make a full recovery. Any kidney problems usually get better without treatment. But sometimes HSP can be severe and last several months. There's also a small chance the kidneys could be permanently damaged ( chronic kidney disease ). This is why it's important to have regular check-ups. Important: Getting HSP again You can get HSP more than once. Get medical advice quickly if the symptoms come back.

    "text": "Hepatitis Hepatitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the liver. It's usually the result of a viral infection or liver damage caused by drinking alcohol. There are several different types of hepatitis. Some types will pass without any serious problems, while others can be long-lasting (chronic) and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) , loss of liver function and, in some cases, liver cancer . Symptoms of hepatitis Short-term (acute) hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so you may not realise you have it. If symptoms do develop, they can include: muscle and joint pain a high temperature feeling and being sick feeling unusually tired all the time a general sense of feeling unwell loss of appetite tummy pain dark urine pale, grey-coloured poo itchy skin yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) See your GP if you have any persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by hepatitis. Long-term (chronic) hepatitis also may not have any obvious symptoms until the liver stops working properly (liver failure) and may only be picked up during blood tests . In the later stages it can cause jaundice, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, confusion , and blood in your stools or vomit. Hepatitis A Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It's usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the poo of an infected person, and is most common in countries where sanitation is poor. Hepatitis A usually passes within a few months, although it can occasionally be severe and even life threatening. There's no specific treatment for it, other than to relieve symptoms like pain, nausea and itching. Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended if: you're at high risk of infection or severe consequences of infection you're travelling to an area where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and eastern Europe. Find out more about hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is spread in the blood of an infected person. It's a common infection worldwide and is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact. It can also be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs. Hepatitis B is uncommon in the UK. It most commonly affects people who became infected while growing up in part of the world where the infection is more common, such as southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months. But most people infected as children develop a long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B, and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medicine can be used to treat it. In the UK, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as: healthcare workers people who inject drugs men who have sex with men children born to mothers with hepatitis B people travelling to parts of the world where the infection is more common Hepatitis B vaccination is also part of the routine immunisation programme so all children can benefit from protection from this virus. Find out more about hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus. It's usually spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. In the UK, it's most commonly spread through sharing needles used to inject drugs. Poor healthcare practices and unsafe medical injections are the main way it's spread outside the UK. Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or only flu-like symptoms, so many people are unaware they're infected. Some people will fight off the infection and be free of the virus. In other cases, it'll stay in the body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis C and can cause cirrhosis and liver failure. Chronic hepatitis C can be treated with very effective antiviral medicines, but there's currently no vaccine available. Find out more about hepatitis C Hepatitis D Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus. It only affects people who are already infected with hepatitis B, as it needs the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body. Hepatitis D is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact or sexual contact. It's uncommon in the UK, but is more widespread in other parts of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South America. Long-term infection with hepatitis D and hepatitis B can increase your risk of developing serious problems, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. There's no vaccine specifically for hepatitis D, but the hepatitis B vaccine can help protect you from it. Hepatitis E Hepatitis E is caused by the hepatitis E virus. The number of cases in Europe has increased in recent years and it's now the most common cause of short-term (acute) hepatitis in the UK. The virus has been mainly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat or offal, but also with wild boar meat, venison and shellfish. Hepatitis E is generally a mild and short-term infection that does not require any treatment, but it can be serious in some people, such as those who have a weakened immune system. There's no vaccine for hepatitis E. When travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, where epidemic hepatitis E may be common, you can reduce your risk by practising good food and water hygiene measures. The British Liver Trust has more information about hepatitis E Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis is a type of hepatitis caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years. The condition is common in the UK and many people do not realise they have it. This is because it does not usually cause any symptoms, although it can cause sudden jaundice and liver failure in some people. Stopping drinking will usually allow your liver to recover, but there's a risk you could eventually develop cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer if you continue to drink alcohol excessively. You can reduce your risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis by controlling how much you drink. It's recommended that you do not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week. Read more about alcohol-related liver disease and the health risks associated with alcohol . Autoimmune hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare cause of long-term hepatitis where the immune system attacks and damages the liver. Eventually, the liver can become so damaged that it stops working properly. Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves very effective medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. It's not clear what causes autoimmune hepatitis and it's not known whether anything can be done to prevent it. The British Liver Trust has more information about autoimmune hepatitis Page last reviewed: 23 August 2022 Next review due: 23 August 2025"

There's a vaccine if you're at high risk or travelling to a country where it's more common. The infection usually only lasts for a few months, but some people can have hepatitis B long-term. How you can get hepatitis B Hepatitis B is caused by a virus that is spread through blood, semen and vaginal fluids. You can get hepatitis B from: having vaginal, anal or oral sex without using a condom or dam injecting drugs using shared needles being injured by a used needle having a tattoo or piercing with unsterilised equipment having a blood transfusion in a country that does not check blood for hepatitis B. Blood transfusions in the UK are checked for hepatitis B. If you're pregnant and have hepatitis B, you can also pass it onto your baby during pregnancy or birth. Hepatitis B from infected blood Since 1972, donated blood has been tested for hepatitis B to make sure it’s as safe as possible. This means the risk of getting an infection from a blood transfusion from it is extremely low. Higher risk areas The risk of getting hepatitis B is higher in some parts of the world, including: Africa Asia the Middle East parts of South America and eastern Europe Information: You can check the risks of a country you're travelling to on the TravelHealthPro website How to prevent hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccination Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis B. In the UK, the hepatitis B vaccine is given to babies as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine . Babies born to mothers with hepatitis B are given additional vaccinations at birth, 4, weeks and 1 year, to reduce the risk of them getting the infection. Adults only need to get the hepatitis B vaccine if they're at high risk, for example: you are travelling to a high-risk country – you may have to pay for a hepatitis B vaccine for travel you have liver or kidney disease you have HIV your job puts you at risk of infection – for example, you're a healthcare worker or work in a prison Your employer should organise your vaccination if your job puts you at risk.

    "text": "Overview - Hepatitis C Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Lifestyle FAQs Complications Hepatitis C is a virus that can infect the liver. If left untreated, it can sometimes cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage to the liver over many years. But with modern treatments, it's usually possible to cure the infection, and most people with it will have a normal life expectancy. It's estimated around 118,000 people in the UK had chronic hepatitis C in 2019. You can become infected with it if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person. Symptoms of hepatitis C Hepatitis C often does not have any noticeable symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without realising it. When symptoms do occur, they can be mistaken for another condition. Symptoms can include: flu-like symptoms , such as muscle aches and a high temperature (fever) feeling tired all the time loss of appetite stomach ache feeling and being sick The only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested. How do you get hepatitis C? The hepatitis C virus is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact. Some ways the infection can be spread include: sharing unsterilised needles – particularly needles used to inject recreational drugs sharing razors or toothbrushes from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby through unprotected sex – although this is very rare In the UK, most hepatitis C infections happen in people who inject drugs or have injected them in the past. It's estimated around half of those who inject drugs have been infected with the virus. Hepatitis C from infected blood before 1996 If you received a blood transfusion before 1996, there's a chance you may have been infected with hepatitis C. Information: If you had a blood transfusion before 1996 and you've not been tested for hepatitis C, contact your GP surgery to discuss any tests you may need. You can also get a free home test for hepatitis C . Find out more about support for people who may have been affected by infected blood . Getting tested for hepatitis C Seek medical advice if you have persistent symptoms of hepatitis C or there's a risk you're infected, even if you do not have any symptoms. A blood test can be carried out to see if you have the infection. You can do a finger-prick test at home to find out if you have hepatitis C. GPs, sexual health clinics, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics or drug treatment services also offer testing for hepatitis C. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or limit any damage to your liver, as well as help ensure the infection is not passed on to other people. Find out how to get a free home test for hepatitis C Find out more about testing for hepatitis C Treatments for hepatitis C Hepatitis C can be treated with medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. These usually need to be taken for several weeks. Until recently, most people would have taken 2 main medicines called pegylated interferon (a weekly injection) and ribavirin (a capsule or tablet). Tablet-only treatments are now available. These new hepatitis C medicines have been found to make treatment more effective, are easier to tolerate, and have shorter treatment courses. They include sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. Using the latest medications, more than 90% of people with hepatitis C may be cured. But it's important to be aware that you will not be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again. Complications of hepatitis C If the infection is left untreated for many years, some people with hepatitis C will develop scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ). Over time, this can cause the liver to stop working properly. In severe cases, life-threatening problems, such as liver failure, where the liver loses most or all of its functions, or liver cancer , can eventually develop. Treating hepatitis C as early as possible can help reduce the risk of these problems happening. Find out more about the complications of hepatitis C Preventing hepatitis C There's no vaccine for hepatitis C, but there are ways to reduce your risk of becoming infected. These include: not sharing any drug-injecting equipment with other people – including needles and other equipment, such as syringes, spoons and filters not sharing razors or toothbrushes that might be contaminated with blood The risk of getting hepatitis C through sex is very low. But it may be higher if blood is present, such as menstrual blood or from minor bleeding during anal sex. Condoms are not usually necessary to prevent hepatitis C for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner.

    "title": "Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hereditary-haemorrahagic-telangiectasia/",
    "text": "Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the blood vessels. It's also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. People with HHT have some blood vessels that have not developed properly and sometimes cause bleeding, known as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). When AVMs form in the lining of the nose or the gut, they can easily bleed. Frequent bleeding can lead to anaemia and sometimes more serious problems. Symptoms of HHT The typical symptoms of HHT include: regular nosebleeds visible red spots in certain places on the body Symptoms usually start in childhood or in the teenage years, but can start at any age. See a GP if you have these symptoms so they can investigate the cause. Nosebleeds Nosebleeds are often the first sign of HHT. They may be frequent and persistent. They happen because of the abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the nose. The loss of blood can lead to iron-deficiency anaemia , if the iron is not replaced through the diet and with iron supplements. Red or purple spots under the skin (telangiectasia) Abnormal blood vessels (telangiectasia) may appear just underneath the skin, which show as red or purple spots. These often start to appear in adolescence. Red or purple spots usually form on the fingertip pads, the lips, and the lining of the nose or the gut. Sometimes, they can form on the ears and face. Abnormal blood vessels (AVMs) inside the body AVMs can form inside the body organs and tissues. Many people with AVMs inside the body will not have any symptoms. However, AVMs in the lungs can lead to low blood oxygen levels and AVMs in the brain can cause seizures or headaches. If AVMs in the body bleed, this can increase the risk of a stroke. Causes of HHT People with HHT have a faulty gene, which is usually inherited from one of their parents. This gene normally provides instructions for making certain proteins found in the lining of the blood vessels. In HHT, the gene cannot produce this protein, or the protein it produces is abnormal. You only need to have 1 copy of the faulty gene to develop HHT. Treatment for HHT There's no cure for HHT, but there are effective treatments. Some people can be treated by a GP and others need to be under the care of a specialist. There are increased risks during pregnancy for women with HHT, such as a slight increased risk of a major bleed or a stroke. Tell a midwife or GP if you have HHT in your family and you become pregnant. Iron supplements If you have regular nosebleeds you will probably lose a lot of iron through this loss of blood, especially if you also bleed from telangiectasia in the gut. It may be necessary to replace the lost iron with iron supplements. Dietary changes alone may not be enough. Read about: the importance of iron iron deficiency anaemia Treatment of nosebleeds People with severe nosebleeds may need emergency nasal packing, where the nose is packed with ribbon gauze or a special nasal sponge. Read about nosebleeds . Some people may need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist for treatment. Laser therapy may help. More severe cases may be treated with skin grafting or other surgery. Blood transfusion after loss of blood If a lot of blood has been lost from bleeding inside the body or after nosebleeds, a blood transfusion may be needed. Read about blood transfusions . Laser treatment for telangiectasia Telangiectasia on the skin or in the lining of the nose can sometimes be improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment: for the skin, you'll usually need a referral to a dermatologist – this may be expensive if treatment is not available on the NHS as 2 to 4 treatments a year may be needed for the nose, you'll need a referral to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist – these treatments are usually available on the NHS Laser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers makes the veins shrink so they're no longer visible. This should leave minimal scarring or damage to the surrounding area. Laser treatment can be uncomfortable, but most people do not need a local anaesthetic. Treating AVMs inside the body AVMs in the body may require specialist treatment. Your HHT specialist will explain any procedures to you in more detail. For example, AVMs in the lung are usually treated, even if they're not causing any apparent problems. They're treated by embolisation, a procedure that blocks the blood supply to the AVM. A tiny plug is inserted inside the artery supplying the abnormal blood vessel. Embolisation is preferred to open surgery and is normally carried out under sedation (which helps relax you during the procedure). For brain AVMs, embolisation, surgery and stereotactic radiotherapy (precisely delivering radiation to the blood vessel) are possible treatment options. Liver AVMs may require different types of specialist treatments. However, these treatments are not always appropriate. Your specialist will explain why many AVMs, such as those in the liver and in the brain, may be better left alone. The risks of treatments may outweigh the potential benefits. Information about you If you have HHT, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Page last reviewed: 09 May 2023 Next review due: 09 May 2026"

    "title": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/",
    "text": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a general term for a group of rare inherited disorders that cause weakness and stiffness in the leg muscles. Symptoms gradually get worse over time. It's also known as familial spastic paraparesis or Strümpell-Lorrain syndrome. It's difficult to know exactly how many people have hereditary spastic paraplegia because it's often misdiagnosed. Symptoms of hereditary spastic paraplegia The severity and progression of symptoms will vary from person to person. About 90% of people with hereditary spastic paraplegia have what's known as a \"pure form\" of the condition. This means their symptoms are mainly confined to lower limb weakness and involuntary spasms and muscle stiffness (spasticity). The remaining 10% have a complicated or complex form of the condition. This means they have other symptoms in addition to the muscle weakness and spasticity. They may have a wide range of symptoms. Pure hereditary spastic paraplegia The main symptoms of pure hereditary spastic paraplegia are: a gradual weakness in the legs increased muscle tone and stiffness (spasticity) problems peeing – such as an urgent need to pee, even when the bladder is not full a lack of sensation in the feet (sometimes) People with the condition may develop leg stiffness and problems walking, such as stumbling and tripping, particularly on uneven ground. These problems are caused by weak hip muscles and difficulty bending the foot upwards. Some people may eventually need to use a walking aid or a wheelchair to help them get around. Others may not need to use any type of mobility equipment. Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia In complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia, additional symptoms may include: nerve damage in the feet or other extremities ( peripheral neuropathy ) epilepsy problems with balance, co-ordination and speech ( ataxia ) eye problems – such as damage to the retina (retinopathy) and damage to the optic nerve (optic neuropathy) dementia ichthyosis – a condition that causes widespread and persistent thick, dry \"fish-scale\" skin learning and developmental problems hearing loss speech, breathing or swallowing problems What causes hereditary spastic paraplegia? Most people with pure hereditary spastic paraplegia will have inherited a faulty gene from 1 of their parents. People with the complicated form of the condition will have usually inherited a faulty gene from both parents. The gene abnormality causes the long nerves in the spine to deteriorate. These nerves normally control muscle tone and movement in the lower body. Diagnosing hereditary spastic paraplegia Hereditary spastic paraplegia is diagnosed after a thorough clinical examination and the identification of typical symptoms. Other conditions that cause mobility problems and muscle stiffness and weakness, such as multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy , need to be ruled out first. A number of specialised tests may be used during diagnosis, including MRI scans of the brain and spine and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. In some cases, genetic testing may also be needed. Treating hereditary spastic paraplegia It's not possible to prevent, slow or reverse hereditary spastic paraplegia, but some of the symptoms can be managed so day-to-day activities become easier. For example: muscle relaxants, such as baclofen, tizandine and botulinum (Botox) injections, can be used to help relieve spasticity regular physiotherapy is important for helping improve and maintain muscle strength and range of movement occupational therapy can help the person carry out their daily activities more easily and regain as much independence as possible braces, splints or shoe inserts can help hold the foot in position and improve walking surgery may occasionally be needed to release tendons or shortened muscles Complications of hereditary spastic paraplegia Possible complications of hereditary spastic paraplegia include: shortening and hardening of the calf muscles – regular physiotherapy may help prevent this cold feet – this is fairly common and occurs as a result of the deterioration of the nerves in the spine extreme tiredness (fatigue) – this may be because of the extra effort needed for walking, and symptoms interrupting sleep back and knee pain – caused by the muscle weakness and walking problems stress and depression Outlook The outlook for people with hereditary spastic paraplegia varies. Some people are severely affected and need a wheelchair, while others have mild symptoms and do not need to use a mobility aid. Pure hereditary spastic paraplegia does not usually affect life expectancy, and most people are able to lead relatively independent and active lives. The outlook for complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia varies between people, depending on the symptoms. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If you or your child have hereditary spastic paraplegia, your clinical team may pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) .

    "title": "Hernia",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hernia/",
    "text": "Hernia A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall. A hernia usually develops between your chest and hips. In many cases, it causes no or very few symptoms, although you may notice a swelling or lump in your tummy (abdomen) or groin. The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down. Coughing or straining may make the lump appear. Types of hernia Inguinal hernias Inguinal hernias occur when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. This is the most common type of hernia and it mainly affects men. It's often associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy. Femoral hernias Femoral hernias also happen when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. They're much less common than inguinal hernias and tend to affect more women than men. Like inguinal hernias, femoral hernias are also associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy. Umbilical hernias Umbilical hernias occur when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through your tummy near your belly button. This type of hernia can occur in babies if the opening in the tummy that the umbilical cord passes through does not seal properly after birth. Adults can also be affected, possibly as a result of repeated strain on the tummy. Hiatus hernias Hiatus hernias occur when part of the stomach pushes up into your chest by squeezing through an opening in the diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the tummy. This type of hernia may not have any noticeable symptoms, although it can cause heartburn in some people. It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernias, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age or pressure on the tummy. Other types of hernia Other types of hernia that can affect the tummy include: incisional hernias – where tissue pokes through a surgical wound in your tummy that has not fully healed epigastric hernias – where fatty tissue pokes through your tummy, between your belly button and the lower part of your breastbone spigelian hernias – where part of your bowel pokes through your tummy at the side of your abdominal muscle, usually below your belly button diaphragmatic hernias – where organs in your tummy move into your chest through an opening in the diaphragm; this can also affect babies if their diaphragm does not develop properly in the womb muscle hernias – where part of the muscle pokes through the tissue; they commonly occur in leg muscles as a result of a sports injury When to seek medical advice See a GP if you think you have a hernia. They may refer you to hospital for surgical treatment, if necessary. You should go to your nearest A&E straight away if you have a hernia and you develop any of the following symptoms: sudden, severe pain being sick difficulty pooing or passing wind the hernia becomes firm or tender, or cannot be pushed back in These symptoms could mean that either: the blood supply to a section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation) a piece of bowel has entered the hernia and become blocked (obstruction) A strangulated hernia and obstructed bowel are medical emergencies and need to be treated as soon as possible. Assessing a hernia A GP will usually be able to identify a hernia by examining the affected area. In some cases, they may refer you to a nearby hospital for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis or assess the extent of the problem. This is a painless scan where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body. Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, a GP or hospital doctor will determine whether surgery to repair the hernia is necessary. A number of factors will be considered when deciding whether surgery is appropriate, including: the type of hernia – some types of hernia are more likely to become strangulated or cause a bowel obstruction than others the content of your hernia – if the hernia contains a part of your bowel, muscle or other tissue, there may be a risk of strangulation or obstruction your symptoms and the impact on your daily life – surgery may be recommended if your symptoms are severe or getting worse, or if the hernia is affecting your ability to carry out your normal activities your general health – surgery may be too much of a risk if your general health is poor Although most hernias will not get better without surgery, they will not necessarily get worse. In some cases, the risks of surgery outweigh the potential benefits. Surgery for a hernia There are 2 main ways surgery for hernias can be carried out: open surgery – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the tummy laparoscopy (keyhole surgery ) – this is a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after surgery and make a full recovery within a few weeks. If your doctor recommends having surgery, it's important to be aware of the potential risks, as well as the possibility of the hernia coming back. Make sure you discuss the benefits and risks of the procedure with your surgeon in detail before having the operation.

It does not normally need treatment if it's not causing you problems. Symptoms of a hiatus hernia You can have a hiatus hernia without knowing and without it being a problem. Symptoms include: a painful burning feeling in your chest, often after eating (heartburn) bringing up small amounts of food or bitter-tasting fluids (acid reflux) bad breath feeling bloated feeling or being sick difficulty or pain when swallowing (dysphagia) These are the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) . Things you can do to ease a hiatus hernia There are things you can do yourself to manage hiatus hernia symptoms. Do eat smaller, more frequent meals raise the head end of your bed by 10 to 20cm so your chest and head are above the level of your waist, which can stop stomach acid travelling up towards your throat try to lose weight if you're overweight try to find ways to relax Don’t do not have food or drink that triggers your symptoms do not eat within 3 or 4 hours of going to bed do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist do not smoke do not drink too much alcohol do not stop taking any prescribed medicine without speaking to a doctor first A pharmacist can help with hiatus hernia symptoms Speak to a pharmacist for advice if you keep getting hiatus hernia symptoms. They may recommend medicines called antacids or alginates, which can help ease your symptoms. It's best to take these with food or soon after eating, as this is when you're most likely to get symptoms. They may also work for longer if taken with food. Although antacids and alginates help symptoms in the short term, they will not cure the problem and should not be taken regularly for long periods. If you're pregnant, a pharmacist can advise you about medicines you can take.

    "text": "Genital herpes Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) passed on through vaginal, anal and oral sex. Treatment from a sexual health clinic can help. Symptoms clear up on their own but can come back. Symptoms of genital herpes Symptoms of genital herpes include: small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around your genitals, anus, thighs or bottom – the sores may be less red on brown or black skin tingling, burning or itching around your genitals pain when you pee discharge that is not usual for you Where genital herpes symptoms appear and what they look like Genital herpes can appear as a blister on the vagina. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/529674/view Blisters can also appear on the penis in a group. Credit: Clinical Photography/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/861692/view You can also get blisters and sores on the buttocks. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/683453/view Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic as soon as possible if: you have symptoms of genital herpes Go even if you have not had sex for a long time, as blisters can take months or years to appear. Information: Why you should go to a sexual health clinic You can see a GP, but they'll probably refer you to a sexual health clinic if they think you might have genital herpes. Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urine system. Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment. They'll often get test results quicker than GP practices and you do not have to pay a prescription fee for treatment. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at a sexual health clinic The doctor or nurse at the sexual health clinic will: ask about your symptoms and your sexual partners use a small cotton bud (swab) to take some fluid from 1 of your blisters or sores for testing The test cannot: be done if you do not have visible blisters or sores tell you how long you've had herpes or who you got it from Symptoms might not appear for weeks or even years after you're infected with the herpes virus. Treatment for genital herpes There's no cure for genital herpes. Symptoms clear up by themselves, but the blisters can come back (an outbreak or recurrence). Treatment from a sexual health clinic can help. Treatment the first time you have genital herpes You may be prescribed: antiviral medicine to stop the symptoms getting worse – you need to start taking this within 5 days of the symptoms appearing cream for the pain If you've had symptoms for more than 5 days before you go to a sexual health clinic, you can still get tested to find out the cause. Treatment if the blisters come back Go to a GP or sexual health clinic if you've been diagnosed with genital herpes and need treatment for an outbreak. Antiviral medicine may help shorten an outbreak by 1 or 2 days if you start taking it as soon as symptoms appear. But outbreaks usually settle by themselves, so you may not need treatment. Recurrent outbreaks are usually milder than the first episode of genital herpes. Over time, outbreaks tend to happen less often and be less severe. Some people never have outbreaks. Some people who have more than 6 outbreaks in a year may benefit from taking antiviral medicine for 6 to 12 months. If you still have outbreaks of genital herpes during this time, you may be referred to a specialist. How to deal with outbreaks yourself There are things you can do if you've been diagnosed with genital herpes and you're having an outbreak. Do keep the area clean using plain or salt water to prevent blisters becoming infected apply an ice pack wrapped in a flannel to soothe pain apply petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) or painkilling cream (such as 5% lidocaine ) to reduce pain when you pee wash your hands before and after applying cream or jelly pee while pouring water over your genitals to ease the pain Don’t do not wear tight clothing that may irritate blisters or sores do not put ice directly on the skin do not touch your blisters or sores unless you're applying cream do not have vaginal, anal or oral sex until the sores have gone away How genital herpes is passed on Genital herpes is very easy to pass on (contagious) from the first tingling or itching of a new outbreak (before any blisters appear) to when sores have fully healed. You may also be able to pass on the virus even if you do not have any symptoms. You can get genital herpes: from skin-to-skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex) when there are no visible sores or blisters if a cold sore touches your genitals by transferring the infection on fingers from someone else to your genitals by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes You cannot get genital herpes from towels, swimming pools, saunas or toilet seats as there is no skin-to-skin contact. Protecting against genital herpes You can reduce the chances of passing on genital herpes by: using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex – but herpes can still be passed on if the condom does not cover the infected area avoiding vaginal, anal or oral sex if you or your partner has blisters or sores, or a tingle or itch that means an outbreak is coming not sharing sex toys – if you do, wash them and put a condom on them Why genital herpes comes back Genital herpes is caused by a virus called herpes simplex. Once you have the virus, it stays in your body. It will not spread in your body to cause blisters elsewhere. It stays in a nearby nerve and causes blisters in the same area. If you can, avoid things that trigger your symptoms. Triggers can include: ultraviolet light on the affected area – for example, from sunbathing or sunbeds friction in your genital area – for example, from sex (lubricant may help) or tight clothing smoking drinking alcohol Some triggers are unavoidable, including: being unwell stress during the menstrual cycle surgery on your genital area a weakened immune system – for example, from having chemotherapy for cancer Genital herpes and HIV Genital herpes can be a more serious condition for people with HIV . If you have HIV and herpes, you'll be referred to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) specialist. Genital herpes and pregnancy Women who have had genital herpes before pregnancy can usually expect to have a healthy baby and a vaginal delivery. However, if you have a herpes outbreak when you give birth, or you get genital herpes for the first time during pregnancy, there's a risk your baby could develop a serious illness called neonatal herpes . You'll be offered medicine from around 32 weeks of pregnancy to reduce this risk. Neonatal herpes can be fatal, but most babies recover with treatment. The risk of your baby getting neonatal herpes is low if you've had genital herpes before. It's higher if you get genital herpes for the first time within the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy. Important See your midwife or a GP if you think you have genital herpes in pregnancy. Genital herpes treatment in pregnancy You may be offered antiviral treatment: to treat outbreaks in pregnancy from week 32 of pregnancy to reduce the chance of an outbreak during birth from diagnosis until the birth if you first get herpes after week 28 of pregnancy Many women with genital herpes have a vaginal delivery. You may be offered a caesarean, depending on your circumstances. Video: Genital herpes - Marian's story In this video, Marian talks about the symptoms, treatment and issues surrounding herpes.

    "title": "Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-herpes/",
    "text": "Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby) Neonatal herpes is a herpes infection in a young baby. The younger the baby, the more vulnerable they are to the harmful effects of infection. Herpes can be very serious for a young baby, whose immune system will not have fully developed to fight off the virus. Neonatal herpes, which is rare in the UK, is caused by the herpes simplex virus. This virus is very common and causes cold sores and genital ulcers in adults. Neonatal herpes can be prevented by following some simple advice. How does a newborn baby catch herpes? During pregnancy and labour If you had genital herpes for the first time within the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy, your newborn baby is at risk of catching herpes. There's a risk you will have passed the infection on to your baby if you had a vaginal delivery. This risk is much lower if you have had genital herpes before. After birth The herpes simplex virus can be passed to a baby through a cold sore if a person has a cold sore and kisses the baby. The herpes virus can also be spread to your baby if you have a blister caused by herpes on your breast and you feed your baby with the affected breast or expressed breast milk from the affected breast. A baby is most at risk of getting a herpes infection in the first 4 weeks after birth. You should not kiss a baby if you have a cold sore to reduce the risk of spreading infection. Cold sores and other blisters caused by the herpes virus are at their most contagious when they burst. They remain contagious until completely healed. What are the warning signs in babies? Because newborn babies have underdeveloped immune systems, they can quickly become seriously ill after catching the virus. Call a GP or contact 111 straight away if your baby: is lethargic or irritable is not feeding has a high temperature (fever) – find out how to take your baby's temperature has a rash or sores on the skin, eyes and inside the mouth These are early warning signs that your baby may be unwell. Call 999 immediately if your baby: is lacking in energy (listless) is becoming floppy and unresponsive is difficult to wake up from sleep has breathing difficulties or starts grunting breathes rapidly has a blue tongue and skin ( cyanosis ) – if they have brown or black skin this may be easier to see on their lips, tongue and gums, under their nails and around their eyes Very often the baby will not have any specific herpes symptoms, such as a rash. But they can become unwell very quickly, so you need to act fast. How is neonatal herpes treated? Neonatal herpes is usually treated with antiviral medicines given directly into the baby's vein (intravenously). This treatment may be needed for several weeks. Any related complications, such as fits (seizures), will also need to be treated. You can breastfeed your baby while they're receiving treatment, unless you have herpes sores around your nipples. If you are taking antiviral treatment too, this can be excreted in your breast milk, but is not thought to cause any harm to your baby. How serious is herpes for a baby? Sometimes neonatal herpes will only affect the baby's eyes, mouth or skin. In these cases, most babies will make a complete recovery with antiviral treatment. But the condition is much more serious if it has spread to the baby's organs. Many infants with this type of neonatal herpes will die, even after they have been treated. If widespread herpes is not treated immediately, there's a high chance the baby will die. How can neonatal herpes be prevented? If you're pregnant and have a history of genital herpes, tell your doctor or midwife. You may need to take medicine during the last month of pregnancy to prevent an outbreak of vaginal sores during labour. Delivery by caesarean section is recommended if the genital herpes has occurred for the first time in the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy. If you develop a cold sore or have any signs of a herpes infection, take these precautions: do not kiss any babies wash your hands before contact with a baby wash your hands before breastfeeding cover up any cold sores, lesions or signs of a herpes infection anywhere on your body to avoid passing on the virus Support and advice if you have been affected You may find these resources helpful: cold sores genital herpes Sands World Health Organization (WHO): herpes simplex virus Page last reviewed: 03 March 2022 Next review due: 03 March 2025"

    "text": "Herpes simplex eye infections A herpes simplex eye infection is a viral infection that can cause a painful, red eye. It's also called eye herpes or ocular herpes. It's important to get treatment because it can sometimes affect your sight. Symptoms of a herpes simplex eye infection Herpes simplex eye infections usually affect only one eye. The symptoms can be similar to some other eye conditions, and can include: eye pain a red eye watering of your eye sensitivity to light blurred vision or other changes to your eyesight a swollen eyelid blisters or a rash on your eyelid or the skin around your eye It's more likely to be a herpes simplex eye infection if you've had one before, or if you've had cold sores . If you keep getting herpes simplex eye infections they may become less painful. If you're not sure it's a herpes simplex eye infection Find out about other conditions that can cause: a red eye eyelid problems watering eyes Non-urgent advice: See a GP or go to an opticians if: you have a red eye with no pain for more than a few days You can get treatment on the NHS for some eye conditions at some opticians – check before you make an appointment. If it's not clear what's causing your red eye, you may be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for tests. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have eye pain you have a red eye that's getting worse you have any changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision you have a swollen, irritated eyelid that has not got better It might not be anything serious, but it's best to get help as it may need to be treated quickly. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You have a red eye and: it hurts to look at light your eye is very dark red one pupil is bigger than the other Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatment for herpes simplex eye infections If a GP thinks you have a herpes simplex eye infection they'll refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). You'll usually be seen the same day so that you can start treatment quickly. You'll usually be prescribed either: an antiviral medicine such as aciclovir , taken as eye ointment, eye drops or sometimes tablets antiviral medicine with steroid eye drops to reduce swelling Most infections will get better with treatment in a couple of weeks and will not permanently affect your eyesight. It's common for herpes simplex eye infections to come back. If you keep getting them a doctor might recommend that you take antiviral tablets every day to help prevent infections. If treatment does not work or you keep getting the infections, your cornea (the transparent front part of your eye) might become scarred, causing sight loss. If this happens you might need to have a cornea transplant . Information: If you use contact lenses, do not wear them until 24 hours after all your symptoms have gone. How you get herpes simplex eye infections Most herpes simplex eye infections are caused by the same herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores . You usually get the herpes simplex virus from skin to skin contact from someone with a cold sore. Once you have it, it stays in your body. It does not usually cause any symptoms, but sometimes it can cause eye infections. This is more likely if you have a weakened immune system. It might also be triggered by an illness, stress, exposure to bright light or an eye injury. You're unlikely to pass the virus on to someone else from an eye infection, but try to avoid touching your eye, and wash your hands regularly.

Do keep the affected finger clean and covered with a dressing take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen , to ease the pain try to discourage children with a whitlow from sucking their thumb Don’t do not touch the infected finger do not touch other people with your infected finger to avoid spreading the infection do not try to drain the fluid by squeezing the affected area do not touch other areas of your body with the infected finger, particularly your eyes – if you wear contact lenses, use the hand that's not affected to put them in and take them out, or wear glasses until the infection has healed Causes of herpetic whitlow Herpetic whitlow is caused by a virus called herpes simplex. You can get it if you touch a cold sore or blister of another infected person. You're more likely to get herpetic whitlow if you've had cold sores or genital herpes. You may also get it if you have a weakened immune system – for example, if you have diabetes or you're having chemotherapy. The first time you have herpetic whitlow will usually be the most severe. Herpetic whitlow can come back Once you have the herpes virus, it stays in your body for the rest of your life, so if you get herpetic whitlow once you can get it again. For example, it might come back if you have a cut or sore on your finger, or if you're feeling stressed or unwell. There's not much you can do to prevent herpetic whitlow but it can be treated in the same way if it comes back.

Symptoms may include: a high temperature difficulty breathing – babies may make grunting noises being sleepier than normal or difficult to wake blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin this may be noticeable under the nails or around the eyes a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin and does not disappear when you press a glass against it a headache a sore throat swollen or painful joints Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if you, your child or someone else: have severe difficulty breathing have blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the lips, tongue, gums and under the nails or around the eyes have a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin and does not fade when you press a glass against it have a seizure (a fit) is not responding normally If you or someone you look after has any of these symptoms, call 999 or go to A&E. Trust your instincts. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Urgent advice: Call 111 now if you, your child or someone else: have difficulty breathing feels very unwell or feels there's something seriously wrong have dark yellow or brown pee or peeing less than normal, for example, your baby has fewer wet nappies keep being sick and cannot keep any food down (or milk for babies and young children) has a high or low temperature, feels hot or cold to touch, or is shivering Do not worry if you're not sure, it's still best to call 111. They can tell you what to do, get a nurse or doctor to call you, or call you an ambulance. Treatment for Hib infection The main treatment for a Hib infection is antibiotics. You'll usually need to be treated in hospital. You may be given oxygen and other medicines such as steroids , depending on your symptoms. Other treatments, including surgery, may also be needed. If you have a Hib infection, your close contacts, such as anyone you live with, may be offered antibiotics to stop them getting ill. Hib vaccination Vaccination is the best way to prevent serious Hib infections. Vaccines that protect against Hib are offered to babies as part of the NHS vaccination schedule . There are 2 vaccines that protect against Hib: 6-in-1 vaccine – given in 3 doses at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old Hib/Men C vaccine – a booster vaccine given at 1 year old If your child was not vaccinated as a baby, you can ask your GP about how they can get it. How Hib spreads Hib is spread by sneezing and coughing, the same as how colds and flu spread. Hib bacteria can live in the nose and throat of many healthy people without causing any problems. But healthy people can still pass it on and cause others to get ill. Some people are more at risk of getting seriously ill from a Hib infection, including: babies and young children people with a weakened immune system, including people who have had their spleen removed older people Page last reviewed: 04 April 2023 Next review due: 04 April 2026"

    "text": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a painful, long-term skin condition that causes skin abscesses and scarring on the skin. The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa is unknown, but it occurs near hair follicles where there are sweat glands, usually around the groin, bottom, breasts and armpits. For reasons that are unknown, more women than men have the condition. It's thought to affect about 1 in 100 people. Symptoms The symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa range from mild to severe. It causes a mixture of boil -like lumps, blackheads, cysts, scarring and channels in the skin that leak pus. Hidradenitis suppurativa can cause fleshy lumps to grow on the surface of the skin Credit: GIRAND/BSIP/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/668613/view Sometimes, narrow channels (sinus tracts) form under the skin, which can break out on the surface and leak pus Credit: Alamy Stock Photo https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-hidradenitis-suppurativa-52484079.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=B6F62B10-1A6C-45D2-B395-4D3CF16D45CE&p=17774&n=0&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dD1ARYB%26qt_raw%3dD1ARYB%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d%7bA883FDE5-7F3D-4472-81F5-B61111916852%7d%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d0%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0%26pl%3d The condition tends to start with blackheads, spots filled with pus and firm pea-sized lumps that develop in one place. The lumps will either disappear or rupture and leak pus after a few hours or days. New lumps will then often develop in an area nearby. If these are not controlled with medicine, larger lumps may develop and spread. Narrow channels called sinus tracts also form under the skin that break out on the surface and leak pus. Hidradenitis suppurativa can be very painful. The lumps develop on the skin in the following areas: around the groin and genitals in the armpits on the bottom and around the anus below the breasts The lumps may also appear on the nape of the neck, waistband and inner thighs. Some of the lumps may become infected with bacteria, causing a secondary infection that will need to be treated with antibiotics . Many people with hidradenitis suppurativa also develop a pilonidal sinus , which is a small hole or \"tunnel\" in the skin at the top of the buttocks, where they divide (the cleft). What causes hidradenitis suppurativa? The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa is unknown, but the lumps develop as a result of blocked hair follicles. Smoking and obesity are both strongly associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, and if you're obese and/or smoke it will make your symptoms worse. Hidradenitis suppurativa usually starts around puberty, but it can occur at any age after puberty. This may suggest that sex hormones play a part. Many people with the condition also have acne and excessive hair growth (hirsutism) . In rare cases, hidradenitis suppurativa may be linked to Crohn's disease , particularly if it develops around the groin area and the skin near the anus. Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes the lining of the digestive system to become inflamed. Hidradenitis suppurativa runs in families in about 1 in 3 cases. It's not infectious and isn't linked to poor hygiene. Diagnosing hidradenitis suppurativa There's no definitive test to help diagnose hidradenitis suppurativa. A GP will examine the affected areas of skin, and they may take a swab of an infected area. This can be helpful in making a diagnosis because the condition is not usually associated with the presence of bacteria that cause skin infections. Hidradenitis suppurativa could be mistaken for acne or ingrown hairs . Treating hidradenitis suppurativa Hidradenitis suppurativa is a lifelong, recurring condition that is often difficult to manage, although the symptoms may improve or eventually stop with treatment. It's important to recognise and diagnose the condition in its early stages to prevent it getting worse. In the early stages, it may be controlled with medicine. Surgery may be required in severe or persistent cases. Antibiotics If you have lumps that are particularly painful, inflamed and oozing pus, you may be prescribed a 1- or 2-week course of antibiotics, if test show that you have a bacterial infection. If bacterial infection is not present, low doses of antibiotics may be used to prevent inflammation. This longer course of antibiotics will last at least 3 months, to reduce the number of lumps that develop. You may be given antibiotics as a cream (topical) or as a tablet, capsule or liquid. Antibiotic types can include lymecycline , doxycycline , erythromycin or clarithromycin . In severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa, a combination of clindamycin and rifampicin can be effective. Antiseptics Antiseptic washes, such as 4% chlorhexidine, applied daily to affected areas are often prescribed alongside other treatments. Retinoids Retinoids, such as acitretin, are vitamin-A based medicines that help some people with hidradenitis suppurativa. Retinoids are always prescribed by dermatologists. They must be used with caution and cannot be taken during pregnancy. It's also important to avoid getting pregnant for 3 years after stopping treatment, so they're not usually prescribed if there's a chance you could get pregnant. Contraceptives If hidradenitis suppurativa flares up before a period you may benefit from taking oral contraceptives. Immunosuppressive treatments In severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa, treatments that suppress the immune system, such as adalimumab or infliximab, can be useful. However, there are risks associated with suppressing the immune system, so they are usually only prescribed by a dermatologist if other treatments do not work. Immunosuppressive treatments such as infliximab and adalimumab are given by injection or infusion at regular intervals, either at home or in hospital. Steroids Rarely, you may be prescribed steroids, such as prednisolone , to reduce severely inflamed skin. Steroids can be taken as skin creams or tablets, or you may have an injection directly into affected skin. Possible side effects of steroids include weight gain, poor sleep and mood swings. Surgery Surgery may be considered in cases where hidradenitis suppurativa cannot be controlled with medicine. Lifestyle advice If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you should: lose weight if you are overweight stop smoking if you smoke use an antiseptic skin wash or antiseptic soap – this may be prescribed alongside other treatment hold a warm flannel on the lumps to encourage the pus to drain wear loose-fitting clothes avoid shaving affected skin Outlook Although hidradenitis suppurativa can persist for many years, if it's diagnosed early the symptoms can be improved with treatment. However, the condition can have a significant impact on a person's everyday life. Having to regularly change dressings and constantly live with the pain and discomfort of the symptoms can affect your quality of life and lead to depression . Speak to a GP if you're finding it difficult to cope. Page last reviewed: 17 March 2023 Next review due: 17 March 2026"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/",
    "text": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a condition where the \"ball and socket\" joint of the hip does not properly form in babies and young children. It's sometimes called congenital dislocation of the hip, or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded, like a ball, and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket. In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). DDH may affect 1 or both hips, but it's more common in the left hip. It's also more common in: girls firstborn children families where there have been childhood hip problems (parents, brothers or sisters) babies born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy Without early treatment, DDH may lead to: problems moving around, for example a limp pain osteoarthritis of the hip and back With early diagnosis and treatment, children are less likely to need surgery, and more likely to develop normally. Diagnosing DDH Your baby's hips will be checked as part of the newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of being born, and again at 6 to 8 weeks of age. The examination involves gently moving your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. It should not cause them any discomfort. If a doctor, midwife or nurse thinks your baby's hip feels unstable, they should have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old. Babies should also have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old if: there have been childhood hip problems in your family your baby was born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy If you have had twins or multiples and 1 of the babies was in the breech position, each baby should have an ultrasound scan of their hips by the time they're 4 to 6 weeks old. Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due, but they should still be checked to make sure. Get help and support from the charity Steps if your baby's been diagnosed with DDH Treating DDH Pavlik harness Babies diagnosed with DDH early in life are usually treated with a fabric splint called a Pavlik harness. This secures both of your baby's hips in a stable position and allows them to develop normally. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/729142/view The harness needs to be worn constantly for 6 to 12 weeks and should not be removed by anyone except a health professional. The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments. Your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you. Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're wearing a Pavlik harness. This will include information on: how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness – nappies can be worn normally cleaning the harness if it's soiled – it still should not be removed, but can be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush positioning your baby while they sleep – they should be placed on their back and not on their side how to avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness – you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed. You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off. Swimming is often recommended. Surgery Surgery may be needed if your baby is diagnosed with DDH after they're 6 months old, or if the Pavlik harness has not helped. The most common surgery is called reduction. This involves placing the femoral head back into the hip socket. Reduction surgery is done under general anaesthetic and may be done as either: closed reduction – the femoral head is placed in the hip socket without making any large cuts open reduction – a cut is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the femoral head into the hip socket Your child may need to wear a cast for at least 12 weeks after the operation. Their hip will be checked under general anaesthetic again after 6 weeks, to make sure it's stable and healing well. After this investigation, your child will probably wear a cast for at least another 6 weeks to allow their hip to fully stabilise. Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date, to correct any bone deformities. Late-stage signs of DDH The newborn physical screening examination, and the infant screening examination at 6 to 8 weeks, aim to diagnose DDH early. But sometimes hip problems can develop or show up after these checks. It's important to contact a GP as soon as possible if you notice your child has developed any of the following symptoms: 1 leg cannot be moved out sideways as far as the other when you change their nappy 1 leg seems to be longer than the other 1 leg drags when they crawl a limp or \"waddling\" walk Your child will be referred to an orthopaedic specialist in hospital for an ultrasound scan if your doctor thinks there's a problem with their hip. Hip-healthy swaddling A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. But if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped (swaddled) with their legs straight and pressed together, there's a risk this may affect their hip development. Using hip-healthy swaddling techniques can reduce this risk. Make sure your baby is able to move their hips and knees freely to kick.

    "title": "Hirschsprung's disease",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hirschsprungs-disease/",
    "text": "Hirschsprung's disease Hirschsprung's disease is a rare condition that causes poo to become stuck in the bowels. It's mainly diagnosed in babies and young children. Normally, the bowel continuously squeezes and relaxes to push poo along, a process controlled by your nervous system. In Hirschsprung's disease, the nerves that control this movement are missing from a section at the end of the bowel, which means poo can build up and form a blockage. This can cause severe constipation and sometimes lead to a serious bowel infection called enterocolitis. The condition is usually picked up soon after birth and treated with surgery as soon as possible. Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease are usually noticeable soon after a baby is born, although sometimes they're not obvious until a child is older. Signs of the condition in a baby include: failing to pass meconium within 48 hours – the dark, tar-like poo that healthy babies pass soon after being born (although some babies later diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease do pass meconium) a swollen belly vomiting green or yellow-green fluid (bile) Signs in older infants and children include: a swollen belly vomiting or a stomach ache persistent constipation that does not get better with the usual treatments not feeding well or not gaining much weight When to get medical advice See a GP if your baby or child has symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease. Hirschsprung's disease can be serious if left untreated, so it's important to get help as soon as possible. If your GP suspects the condition, they'll refer you to hospital for tests to confirm the diagnosis. Call 999 or go to your nearest A&E if your child has symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease, as well as: a high temperature of 38C or more watery, foul-smelling or bloody diarrhoea These could be the signs of a bowel infection (enterocolitis), which can be serious and lead to sepsis. How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed Your child's tummy will usually be examined and sometimes a rectal examination may be carried out. This is where a doctor or nurse inserts a finger into the back passage (rectum) to feel for abnormalities. If Hirschsprung's disease is suspected, an X-ray can be done to show a blockage and bulge in the bowel. The diagnosis can be confirmed by doing a rectal biopsy , which involves inserting a small instrument into your child's bottom to remove a tiny sample of the affected bowel. This is then examined under the microscope to see if the nerve cells are missing. What causes Hirschsprung's disease? The muscles of the bowel are controlled by nerve cells called ganglion cells. In Hirschsprung's disease, ganglion cells are missing from a section at the end of bowel, extending up from the anus (the opening in the bottom that poo passes through). For some reason, the cells did not develop in that area when the baby was growing in the womb. It's not clear why this happens, but it's not thought to be caused by anything the mother did while she was pregnant. A number of genes are associated with Hirschsprung's disease and it does sometimes run in families. If you have had a child with it before, you're more likely to have another child with it. The condition is occasionally part of a wider genetic condition, such as Down's syndrome , but most cases are not. Treatments for Hirschsprung's disease All children with Hirschsprung's disease will need surgery. As they wait for surgery, they may need to: stop having milk feeds and instead be given fluids directly into a vein have a tube passed through their nose and into their stomach to drain away any fluid and air collecting in it have regular bowel washouts, where a thin tube is inserted into their bottom and warm salt water is used to soften and flush out the trapped stools take antibiotics if they have enterocolitis Your child may need to stay in hospital during this time, or you may be able to look after them at home. Your doctor will advise you about this. Surgery Most children will have the \"pull-through\" operation, where the affected section of bowel is removed and the remaining healthy sections of bowel are joined together. If your child is not well enough to have this procedure (for example, because they have enterocolitis or a severe blockage), or if they're older than a newborn, they may have it in 2 stages. In the 1st stage, the surgeon will divert the bowel through a temporary opening (stoma) made in the tummy. This procedure is called a colostomy formation. Stools will pass directly out of the opening into a pouch worn on your child's body until they're well enough for the 2nd stage to remove the affected section of bowel, close the opening and join the healthy sections of bowel together. These procedures can be done using either: laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery – this involves inserting surgical instruments through tiny cuts open surgery – where a larger cut is made in your child's tummy Speak to your surgeon about the best option for your child. Risks of surgery No surgery is risk-free. There's a small chance of: bleeding during or after the operation the bowel becoming infected (enterocolitis) bowel contents leaking into the body, which could lead to serious infection ( peritonitis ) if not treated quickly the bowel becoming narrowed or blocked again, requiring further surgery Recovery from surgery Your child will probably need to stay in hospital for a few days after surgery. They'll be given pain-relieving medicine to make them comfortable and fluids into a vein until they can manage food and drink. No special diet is needed once you get home, but it's important they drink plenty of fluids as they recover. Your child should recover well and their bowels should function normally if they've had a pull-through operation or both stages of the 2 stage operation. At first they'll probably have a sore bottom when they poo. It can help to: leave their bottom open to the air whenever possible use baby oil to gently clean their bottom use nappy cream after each change Call 999 or go to your nearest A&E if your child develops problems such as a swollen belly, new tummy pain, a fever or foul-smelling diarrhoea. Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease Most children are able to pass stools normally and have a normal functioning bowel after surgery, although they may take a bit longer to toilet train. Some may experience persistent constipation and need to follow a high-fibre diet and take laxatives . Your doctor will advise about this treatment. Some children have problems controlling their bowels ( bowel incontinence ), which can last until they're a teenager and be very distressing. Speak to your GP if this is a problem. You can also read advice about soiling in children . There is a small possibility that your child may need a permanent stoma. Information about your child If your child has been affected by Hirschsprung's disease, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Overview - HIV and AIDS Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Prevention HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus. While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can. There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan. Symptoms of HIV infection Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected. Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested. Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk. Read more about who's most at risk of HIV Causes of HIV infection HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk. It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include: sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex. HIV from infected blood Since 1985, donated blood has been tested for HIV to make sure it’s as safe as possible. This means the risk of getting an infection from a blood transfusion from it is extremely low. Diagnosing HIV Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. It's important to be aware that: emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help: clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Treatment for HIV Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test. Living with HIV If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others. You'll also be encouraged to: take regular exercise eat a healthy diet stop smoking have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur. If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby. Preventing HIV Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection. There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including: using a condom for sex post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk. For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex. This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

A pharmacist can help with hives A pharmacist can give you advice about antihistamine treatment to help a hives rash. Tell the pharmacist if you have a long-term condition, because you might not be able to take antihistamines. This treatment might not be suitable for young children. Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: symptoms of hives do not improve after 2 days you're worried about your child's hives the rash is spreading hives keeps coming back (you may be allergic to something) you also have a high temperature and feel unwell you also have swelling under your skin (this might be angioedema ) You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air) your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet) you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy someone faints and cannot be woken up a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face) You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised or itchy. These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital. Find your nearest A&E Treatment for hives from a GP A GP might prescribe menthol cream, antihistamines or steroid tablets . If hives does not go away with treatment, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). You cannot always prevent hives You get hives when something causes high levels of histamine and other chemicals to be released in your skin. This is known as a trigger. Triggers can include: eating certain foods contact with certain plants, animals, chemicals and latex cold, such as cold water or wind hot, sweaty skin from exercise, emotional stress or eating spicy food a reaction to a medicine, insect bite or sting scratching or pressing on your skin, such as wearing itchy or tight clothing an infection a problem with your immune system water or sunlight, but this is rare Try to find out what triggers hives for you, so you can avoid those triggers, if possible.

    "text": "Overview - Hodgkin lymphoma Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Read more about the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma . Who's affected? Hodgkin lymphoma can develop at any age, but it mostly affects people between 20 and 40 years of age and those over 75. Slightly more men than women are affected. Around 2,100 people are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK each year. Causes of Hodgkin lymphoma The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if: you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system you take immunosuppressant medicine you've previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever You also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition. Read more about the causes of Hodgkin lymphoma . How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed The only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy . This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory. Read more about diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma . Treatment and outlook Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it's also one of the most easily treated types of cancer. Your recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment. The main treatments used are chemotherapy , followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn't generally used as a treatment for the condition. Overall, around 8 out of 10 people with Hodgkin lymphoma live at least 5 years and most of these will be cured. However, there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.

    "title": "Homocystinuria",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/homocystinuria/",
    "text": "Homocystinuria Homocystinuria (HCU) is a rare but potentially serious inherited condition. It means the body can't process the amino acid methionine. This causes a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids, which are the \"building blocks\" of protein. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with HCU are unable to fully break down methionine, causing a build-up of methionine and a chemical called homocysteine. This build-up can be harmful. Diagnosing homocystinuria At around 5 days old, babies are offered a newborn blood spot test to check if they have HCU. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test. If HCU is diagnosed, treatment can be given to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment may include trial doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), a special diet and advice. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with HCU are able to live healthy lives. However, treatment for HCU must be continued for life. Babies born with HCU don't usually have any symptoms in the first year of their life. But severe symptoms can develop later in life without early treatment. These may include: vision problems, such as severe short-sightedness (myopia) weak bones ( osteoporosis ) bone and joint problems a risk of developing blood clots and strokes Some children with untreated HCU are also at risk of brain damage, and their development might be affected. Treating homocystinuria Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) In some babies, it's possible to control the levels of homocysteine with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). If this works, your child will need to take vitamin B6 supplements for the rest of their life. Diet Children diagnosed with HCU that doesn't respond to vitamin B6 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of methionine your baby receives. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Special formula milk may be used. The diet will be designed to contain all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. As your baby moves on to solid foods, your dietitian can explain which low-protein foods are suitable. Some of these may be available on prescription, including low-protein rusks, milk substitutes and low-protein pasta. People with HCU may need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Regular blood tests will also be needed to monitor the amount of homocysteine in their blood. Medicine Alongside a low-protein diet, your child may be prescribed a medicine called betaine in later childhood to help clear some of the excess homocysteine. Medicine for HCU needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. How homocystinuria is inherited The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for HCU is passed on by parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition. The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition – one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of HCU. If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has: a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition a 2 in 4 chance of being a carrier of HCU a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it's not possible to prevent HCU, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about your child If your child has HCU, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about NCARDRS on GOV.UK .

    "text": "Overview - Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), sometimes known as Hughes syndrome, is a disorder of the immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots. This means people with APS are at greater risk of developing conditions such as: DVT (deep vein thrombosis , a blood clot that usually develops in the leg arterial thrombosis (a clot in an artery), which can cause a stroke or heart attack blood clots in the brain, leading to problems with balance, mobility, vision, speech and memory Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage , although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. APS doesn't always cause noticeable problems. Some people have general symptoms that can be similar to those of multiple sclerosis (a common condition affecting the central nervous system), such as tiredness or numbness and tingling in different parts of the body. Find out more about signs and symptoms of APS What causes antiphospholipid syndrome? APS is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, which usually protects the body from infection and illness, attacks healthy tissue by mistake. In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies. These target proteins attached to fat molecules (phospholipids), which makes the blood more likely to clot. It's not known what causes the immune system to produce abnormal antibodies. As with other autoimmune conditions, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to play a part. Find out more about the causes of APS Who's affected APS can affect people of all ages, including children and babies. But most people are diagnosed with APS between 20 and 50 years of age, and it affects 3 to 5 times as many women as men. It's not clear how many people in the UK have the condition. Diagnosing APS Diagnosing APS can sometimes be difficult, as some of the symptoms are similar to multiple sclerosis. This means blood tests to identify the antibodies responsible for APS are essential in diagnosing the condition. Find out more about diagnosing APS How antiphospholipid syndrome is treated Although there's no cure for APS, the risk of developing blood clots can be greatly reduced if it's correctly diagnosed. An anticoagulant medicine , such as warfarin , or an antiplatelet, such as low-dose aspirin , is usually prescribed. These reduce the likelihood of unnecessary blood clots forming, but still allow clots to form when you cut yourself. Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there's about an 80% chance of having a successful pregnancy. Most people respond well to treatment and can lead normal, healthy lives. But a small number of people with APS continue to experience blood clots despite extensive treatment. Find out more about treating APS Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome In very rare cases, blood clots can suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. This is known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS requires immediate emergency treatment in hospital with high-dose anticoagulants .

    "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the name of a very common group of viruses. They do not cause any problems in most people, but some types can cause genital warts or cancer. HPV affects the skin. There are more than 100 different types. Symptoms of human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV does not usually cause any symptoms. Most people who have it do not realise and do not have any problems. But sometimes the virus can cause painless growths or lumps around your vagina, penis or anus ( genital warts ). How human papillomavirus (HPV) is spread Many types of HPV affect the mouth, throat or genital area. They're easy to catch. You do not need to have penetrative sex. You can get HPV from: any skin-to-skin contact of the genital area vaginal, anal or oral sex sharing sex toys HPV has no symptoms, so you may not know if you have it. It's very common. Most people will get some type of HPV in their life. Important You do not have to have sexual contact with a lot of people to get HPV. You can get HPV the first time you have sex. Conditions linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) Most of the time HPV does not cause any problems. In some people, some types of HPV can cause: genital warts abnormal changes in the cells that can sometimes turn into cancer HPV types linked to cancer are called high-risk types. Cancers linked to high-risk HPV include: cervical cancer anal cancer penile cancer vulval cancer vaginal cancer some types of head and neck cancer You can have HPV for many years without it causing problems. You can have it even if you have not been sexually active or had a new partner for many years. Testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV testing is part of cervical screening. There's no blood test for HPV. During cervical screening, a small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and tested for HPV. Screening is offered to all women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64. It helps protect them against cervical cancer. Find out more about cervical screening and how it helps protect against cervical cancer How to protect yourself against human papillomavirus (HPV) You cannot fully protect yourself against HPV, but there are things that can help. Condoms can help protect you against HPV, but they do not cover all the skin around your genitals, so you're not fully protected. The HPV vaccine protects against the types of HPV that cause most cases of genital warts and cervical cancer, as well as some other cancers. It does not protect against all types of HPV. Find out more about the HPV vaccine and who can have it Treating human papillomavirus (HPV) infections There's no treatment for the HPV infection. Most HPV infections do not cause any problems and are cleared by your body within 2 years. If HPV causes problems, such as genital warts or changes to cells in the cervix, you can have treatment for these. Page last reviewed: 27 May 2022 Next review due: 27 May 2025"

    "text": "Huntington's disease Huntington's disease is an inherited condition that affects your movement, thinking and mood. It gets worse over time and cannot currently be cured, but there are treatments to help with the symptoms. Symptoms of Huntington's disease Symptoms of Huntington's disease usually start in adults aged between 30 and 50, but it can happen at any age. It affects people who have a parent with the condition. The symptoms develop slowly. Early symptoms can include: difficulty concentrating and planning tasks memory problems low mood, depression and anxiety changes in your behaviour and personality, such as becoming more irritable or impulsive – sometimes other people find these changes easier to notice small twitching or jerking movements that you cannot control (called chorea) becoming clumsy and finding it difficult to control your muscles These symptoms slowly get worse over several years. In the later stages, symptoms can also include: difficulty swallowing and speaking losing weight your muscles becoming stiff, and movement becoming slower and more difficult more severe mood or personality changes Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you could have Huntington's disease one of your parents has Huntington's disease and you want to know if you're at risk of getting it If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to see a GP. You could also suggest that you go with them. Important Some of these symptoms are common and can be caused by many different conditions. Having them does not definitely mean you have Huntington's disease. But it's important to get them checked by a GP. Causes of Huntington's disease Huntington's disease is an inherited genetic condition. It's caused by an altered gene being passed on to a child by one of their parents. Having the altered gene causes damage to certain areas of your brain. This affects your movement, memory and thinking. If you have the altered gene, you may have no symptoms for many years, but eventually you will develop Huntington's disease. If one of your parents carries the altered gene, there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance that you will have the gene and develop Huntington's disease. Information: Find out more Huntington's Disease Association: what causes Huntington's disease Tests for Huntington's disease If you have symptoms of Huntington's disease, a GP will refer you to a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect your brain (neurologist) for tests and treatment. If one of your parents has Huntington's disease or you have symptoms, you can choose to have a genetic test to find out whether you have the altered gene that causes the condition. You'll usually need to be 18 or older to have the test. It's your choice whether you have the test. As Huntington's disease cannot currently be prevented, some people choose not to get tested, especially if they do not have symptoms. Your GP can arrange an appointment with a specialist called a genetic counsellor, who can help you decide. Information: Find out more Huntington's Disease Association: genetic testing How Huntington's disease affects your life Huntington's disease gets slowly worse over time and affects how long you'll live. How it affects you depends on your symptoms and how quickly they get worse. Most people live for many years after symptoms start, but eventually you'll need support with daily living. Having Huntington's disease or having a parent with it can also affect decisions like planning for the future and starting a family. You'll be offered support for your wellbeing and mental health, as well as help for any physical symptoms. If you're diagnosed with Huntington's disease, your doctor will be able to discuss how your condition may affect you and your family. Treatment for Huntington's disease There's currently no cure for Huntington's disease and no treatments that can stop the symptoms getting worse. The aim of treatment will be to help you manage the symptoms and stay comfortable and independent for as long as possible. You'll be supported by a team of healthcare professionals, who will help to create a care plan. Treatment you might be offered includes: treatment for depression, such as antidepressants and talking therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medicines that can help with mood and behaviour changes medicines to help with symptoms such as twitching and jerking (chorea) physiotherapy to help with movement problems occupational therapy to help with daily activities speech and language therapy You may also be offered genetic counselling to help you understand your diagnosis and how your family members may be affected. Help and support for Huntington's disease Huntington's disease can be a difficult condition to live with, both physically and emotionally. If you or someone in your family needs help with daily living because of illness or disability, find out about social care and support options . As well as support from your healthcare team, you may find it helpful to talk to other people with Huntington's disease, either at a local support group or online.

    "text": "Overview - Hydrocephalus Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Hydrocephalus is a build-up of fluid in the brain. The excess fluid puts pressure on the brain, which can damage it. If left untreated, hydrocephalus can be fatal. Symptoms of hydrocephalus The damage to the brain from hydrocephalus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: headache being sick blurred vision difficulty walking Different types of hydrocephalus can cause specific symptoms. Read more about the symptoms of hydrocephalus . Types of hydrocephalus There are 3 main types of hydrocephalus: congenital hydrocephalus – hydrocephalus that's present at birth acquired hydrocephalus – hydrocephalus that develops after birth normal pressure hydrocephalus – usually only develops in older people Hydrocephalus present from birth Congenital hydrocephalus is when a baby is born with excess fluid in their brain. It can be caused by a condition such as spina bifida , or an infection the mother develops during pregnancy, such as mumps or rubella (German measles). Many babies born with hydrocephalus (congenital hydrocephalus) have permanent brain damage. This can cause several long-term complications, such as: learning disabilities speech problems memory problems short attention span problems with organisational skills vision problems, such as a squint and vision loss problems with physical coordination epilepsy If your child has learning disabilities, they'll need extra support from their nursery or school to ensure their needs are being met. Hydrocephalus that develops in children or adults Acquired hydrocephalus can affect children or adults. It usually develops after an illness or injury. For example, it may happen after a serious head injury or as a complication of a medical condition, such as a brain tumour . Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an uncommon and poorly understood condition that most often affects people over the age of 60. It can sometimes develop after an injury or a stroke , but in most cases the cause is unknown. Mobility problems, dementia and urinary incontinence are the main symptoms of NPH. But because these symptoms happen gradually and are similar to those of other, more common conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease , NPH can be difficult to diagnose. Diagnosing hydrocephalus Brain scans, such as CT scans and MRI scans , can be used to diagnose congenital and acquired hydrocephalus. A checklist is used to help diagnose NPH. For example, how you walk, your mental ability and symptoms that affect your bladder control will be assessed. It's important to diagnose NPH correctly because, unlike Alzheimer’s disease, the symptoms can be relieved with treatment. Read more about diagnosing hydrocephalus . Treating hydrocephalus Hydrocephalus can usually be treated using a thin tube (shunt) that's surgically implanted in the brain and drains away the excess fluid. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) can sometimes be used as an alternative to shunt surgery. During this procedure, a hole is made in the floor of the brain to allow the trapped fluid to escape to the surface, where it can be absorbed. Read more about how hydrocephalus is treated . Complications after surgery The surgery used to treat hydrocephalus can sometimes cause complications. For example, a shunt can become blocked or infected. Before having surgery, your surgeon should discuss the possible complications with you. Read more about the complications of surgery for hydrocephalus . What causes hydrocephalus? In the past, hydrocephalus was referred to as \"water on the brain\". However, the brain is not surrounded by water but by a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF has 3 important functions: it protects the brain from damage it removes waste products from the brain it provides the brain with the nutrients it needs to function properly The brain constantly produces new CSF (about a pint a day), while old fluid is released from the brain and absorbed into the blood vessels. But if this process is interrupted, the amount of CSF can quickly build up, cause pressure in the brain. Read more about the causes of hydrocephalus . Help and support If you have a child with hydrocephalus, or if you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by hydrocephalus. Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with the details of local support groups and organisations. You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website . Page last reviewed: 06 February 2023 Next review due: 06 February 2026 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Overview - Hydronephrosis Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Hydronephrosis is a condition where one or both kidneys become stretched and swollen as the result of a build-up of urine inside them. It can affect people of any age and is sometimes spotted in unborn babies during routine pregnancy ultrasound scans . This is known as antenatal hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis does not generally cause any long-term problems if it's diagnosed and treated promptly. Babies with the condition may not require any treatment at all. The condition can increase your chances of getting urinary tract infections (UTIs) . In severe cases that are left untreated, the kidneys may become scarred, which could lead to loss of kidney function (kidney failure) . Antenatal hydronephrosis in babies Antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) is increasingly being found in unborn babies during routine ultrasound scans. It's estimated to show up on at least 1 in every 100 pregnancies. As a parent, it can be worrying to learn your baby has a problem with their kidneys. But most cases of hydronephrosis in babies are not serious and should not affect the outcome of your pregnancy. Sometimes, babies born with ANH may need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent kidney infections, but most babies born with ANH will have no lasting problems. Find out more about diagnosing antenatal hydronephrosis and treating antenatal hydronephrosis . Signs and symptoms Antenatal hydronephrosis does not usually cause any symptoms. It is often found during pre-natal scans or in tests that are being done for other reasons. Symptoms for children and adults can include: pain in your back or side – this may be sudden and severe, or may be a dull ache that comes and goes over time; it may get worse after you have drunk a lot of fluid symptoms of a UTI , such as needing to pee more often, pain or a burning sensation while peeing, and feeling tired and unwell blood in your urine urinating less often than you used to or with a weak stream You should see your doctor or contact 111 if you have any of these symptoms. They may refer you for an ultrasound scan to assess your kidneys. Antenatal hydronephrosis in babies does not usually cause symptoms after birth, but you should seek medical advice as soon as possible if your baby develops signs of a possible UTI, such as a high fever without any other obvious cause. Find out about diagnosing hydronephrosis . What causes hydronephrosis? Antenatal hydronephrosis Antenatal hydronephrosis diagnosed in pregnancy is usually mild. It's thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of urine your baby produces in the later stages of pregnancy. In more severe cases, it may be caused by a blockage in the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys, or a blockage in the flow of urine out of the bladder. Adult hydronephrosis In adults, hydronephrosis is commonly caused by: kidney stones pregnancy (maternal hydronephrosis) an enlarged prostate gland in men narrowing of the ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder) caused by injury, infection or surgery some types of cancer, including kidney cancer , bladder cancer , prostate cancer or ovarian cancer Find out about the causes of hydronephrosis . Treating hydronephrosis If you have hydronephrosis, your treatment will depend on what's causing the condition and how severe it is. Pregnant women and babies with the condition may not require any treatment. In adults, the first stage of treatment is often to drain the urine out of your kidneys by inserting a tube called a catheter into your bladder or kidneys. This will help relieve the pressure on your kidneys. Once the pressure has been relieved, the cause of the build-up of urine may need to be treated. The treatments used will depend on why the condition developed. For example: kidney stones may be removed during an operation or broken up using sound waves an enlarged prostate can be treated with medication or surgery to remove some of the prostate blockages in the ureters can be treated using surgery to insert a small tube called a stent cancer may be treated using a combination of chemotherapy , radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous tissue Find out about how hydronephrosis is treated .

It can be treated with surgery and medicines. Information: There is separate information about hypoparathyroidism , which is where there is not enough calcium in the body. Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism Many people with hyperparathyroidism have no, or very mild, symptoms. You may only find out you have it after having tests for something else. When symptoms do happen, they include: tiredness aches and pains, particularly in your joints, hands, arms, feet and legs muscle weakness feeling and being sick loss of appetite constipation tummy pain feeling thirsty all the time peeing more than usual low mood and depression Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have hyperparathyroidism Causes of hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism is caused by your body producing too much calcium. Calcium helps with things like keeping your bones and teeth healthy. The amount of calcium in the body is controlled by tiny glands in your neck called the parathyroid glands. Hyperparathyroidism can happen for 2 main reasons: your parathyroid glands become swollen due to a non-cancerous growth – this is called primary hyperparathyroidism your parathyroid glands cause too much calcium to be produced because another condition you have (such as chronic kidney disease) has lowered your calcium level – this is called secondary hyperparathyroidism Tests for hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism can be diagnosed by testing samples of your blood and pee. Many people are first diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism when they are having blood or pee tests for something else. If you have hyperparathyroidism, further tests and scans may then be recommended to check your general health and help plan treatment. These can include: ultrasound scans X-rays bone density scans Treatments for hyperparathyroidism If you’re diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism, you’ll be referred to a specialist for treatment. The treatment recommended for you will depend on your calcium levels, your symptoms and if you have any other health conditions. You may not need treatment if your calcium levels are not too high and are not causing you any problems. If you do need treatment, you may be offered surgery to remove part or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck. If you’re unable to have surgery or do not want it, you may need medicines to help lower your calcium levels. You may also be given medicines after surgery if testing shows your calcium levels are still high. Important Do not make any changes to your diet to try to lower your calcium levels, unless you have been told to by your specialist. A change in your usual diet could make your symptoms worse or cause more serious problems. Complications of hyperparathyroidism If hyperparathyroidism is not treated, it can lead to complications: These include: osteoporosis – where your bones become weaker and more likely to break kidney stones high blood pressure , which can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke Information: Find out more Parathyroid UK is a charity that provides support and information for people living with parathyroid gland conditions.

    "text": "Overview - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications An overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis, is where the thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea). It produces hormones that affect things such as your heart rate and body temperature. Having too much of these hormones can cause unpleasant and potentially serious problems that may need treatment. An overactive thyroid can affect anyone, but it's about 10 times more common in women than men, and typically happens between 20 and 40 years of age. Symptoms of an overactive thyroid An overactive thyroid can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: nervousness, anxiety and irritability mood swings difficulty sleeping persistent tiredness and weakness sensitivity to heat swelling in your neck from an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre) an irregular and/or unusually fast heart rate (palpitations) twitching or trembling weight loss Find out more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid When to see a GP See a GP if you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid. They'll ask about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem, they can arrange for a blood test to check how well your thyroid is working. If the blood test shows that you have an overactive thyroid, you may be referred for further tests to identify the cause. Find out more about how an overactive thyroid is diagnosed Treatments for an overactive thyroid An overactive thyroid is usually treatable. The main treatments are: medicine that stops your thyroid producing too much of the thyroid hormones radioiodine treatment – where a type of radiotherapy is used to destroy cells in the thyroid, reducing its ability to produce thyroid hormones surgery to remove some or all of your thyroid, so that it no longer produces thyroid hormones Each of these treatments has benefits and drawbacks. You'll usually see a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to discuss which treatment is best for you. Find out more about how an overactive thyroid is treated Causes of an overactive thyroid There are several reasons why your thyroid can become overactive. These include: Graves' disease – an autoimmune condition where the immune system produces antibodies that cause the thyroid to produce too much thyroid hormone (about 4 in every 5 people with an overactive thyroid have Graves' disease) lumps (nodules) on the thyroid – this extra thyroid tissue can produce thyroid hormones, causing your levels to be too high some medicines such as amiodarone, which can be used to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Find out more about the causes of an overactive thyroid Further problems An overactive thyroid can sometimes lead to further problems, particularly if it's not treated or well controlled. These include: eye problems – such as eye irritation, double vision or bulging eyes pregnancy complications – such as pre-eclampsia , premature birth or miscarriage a thyroid storm – a sudden and life-threatening flare-up of symptoms Find out more about the complications of an overactive thyroid Help and support British Thyroid Foundation: help and support if you have an overactive thyroid Page last reviewed: 11 April 2023 Next review due: 11 April 2026 Next : Symptoms"

It needs to be treated quickly to stop it getting worse, but you can usually treat it yourself. You can also have blood sugar that's too high. This is called high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) . Symptoms of low blood sugar Low blood sugar usually affects people with diabetes who take insulin or some other diabetes medicines. It's rare in people without diabetes. Symptoms of low blood sugar can include: feeling hungry feeling dizzy feeling anxious or irritable sweating shaking tingling lips heart palpitations feeling tired or weak changes in your vision such as blurred vision feeling confused If you have severe low blood sugar you may: have a seizure or fit become unconscious Important: Checking your blood sugar If you have diabetes and get any symptoms of low blood sugar, check your blood sugar if you can.

It can lead to problems with your bones, muscles and nerves, but can usually be treated by taking supplements. Information: Hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism is a condition where there is too much calcium in the body. It is more common than hypoparathyroidism. Find out more about hyperparathyroidism Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism Hypoparathyroidism often starts if glands in your neck are damaged during surgery. Symptoms include: a tingling or burning sensation in your fingers, toes and face muscle pain, stiffness and spasms tummy pain brittle nails, dry hair and dry skin cataracts (cloudy patches that form at the front of your eyes) Less common and more serious symptoms include: confusion an irregular heartbeat seizures (fits) Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have hypoparathyroidism If you recently had neck or head surgery, you should have been given details of who to contact in case of complications. Try this first before talking to a GP. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: You think someone's having a seizure and: it's the first time it's happened it lasts longer than is usual for them, or longer than 5 minutes if you do not know how long their seizures usually last Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Causes of hypoparathyroidism Hypoparathyroidism happens when small glands in your neck (parathyroid glands) do not work properly. These glands help control the level of calcium in your body. If they're not working properly, your calcium level may become too low. Calcium is a mineral that the body needs to keep bones, muscles and nerves working properly. Most of the time hypoparathyroidism is caused by the parathyroid glands being damaged during surgery to the neck or head. Types of surgery that carry this risk of damage include surgery for an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid , and surgery for head or neck cancer . Other causes of hypoparathyroidism include: conditions where the body's immune system damages healthy tissue, such as Addison's disease some rare genetic conditions Tests for hypoparathyroidism If there's a chance you have hypoparathyroidism, you may have a number of blood tests to measure how much calcium is in your blood and to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. A low level of calcium can be a sign of hypoparathyroidism. If you're having neck or head surgery, you may have these tests soon after surgery. This is used to check if there was any damage to your parathyroid glands. Treatments for hypoparathyroidism Hypoparathyroidism can be treated by taking: calcium supplements – to raise the level of calcium in your body vitamin D supplements – vitamin D helps your body make better use of calcium You'll usually need to take supplements for the rest of your life. You may be offered supplements even if you do not have any symptoms, but tests show damage to your parathyroid glands. This helps lower the risk of any serious problems. You may also be advised to make some changes to your diet, such as: eating foods high in calcium, such as dairy products, green leafy vegetables, soy and tofu avoiding or cutting down on red meat and starchy foods, like pasta and white bread You'll need regular blood tests to check your calcium levels. If these tests show supplements are not working well, then you may need extra medicines. Complications of hypoparathyroidism If you have hypoparathyroidism and your calcium level becomes too low, it can cause seizures and serious heart problems. If this happens, you'll need to be treated in hospital. You'll be given calcium through a tube into a vein, until your calcium level returns to normal. Help and support for hypoparathyroidism If you have hypoparathyroidism, health professionals will be there to support you throughout your treatment.

    "text": "Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is a common condition where the thyroid gland in your neck does not make enough hormones. This can cause symptoms like tiredness and weight gain. It can be managed with treatment. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid Symptoms of an underactive thyroid may be mild and may not be easy to notice. Common symptoms include: feeling extremely tired (fatigue) feeling cold more than usual putting on weight constipation difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly low mood or depression dry skin, dry hair or hair loss a croaky (hoarse) voice irregular or heavy periods if you have them Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have an underactive thyroid Some of the symptoms are common and can be caused by other conditions. But it's important to get them checked by a GP. How an underactive thyroid is diagnosed If a GP thinks you might have an underactive thyroid, they'll ask about your symptoms. They'll also ask if someone else in your family has had a thyroid condition or an autoimmune condition, or if you've recently been pregnant. The GP may examine your neck to find out if your thyroid gland is swollen. You may have blood tests to check how much thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) is in your blood. The GP may also refer you to a specialist for more tests. Information: Find out more British Thyroid Foundation: Thyroid function tests Thyroid UK: Getting a diagnosis Treatment for an underactive thyroid An underactive thyroid is usually treated with medicine to replace the thyroid hormone that your body cannot produce. This medicine is usually levothyroxine tablets. You'll usually need to take them for the rest of your life to prevent your symptoms returning. You should be able to live a normal life. Important You'll have regular blood tests to check you're on the right dose of levothyroxine. Being on the wrong dose can cause side effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, headaches or problems sleeping. If you have any side effects, talk to your GP or a pharmacist. Causes of an underactive thyroid In the UK, the main cause of an underactive thyroid is an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto's disease. If you have Hashimoto's disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland meaning it cannot make enough thyroid hormone. Hashimoto's disease is most common in women, and usually starts between the ages of 30 and 50. But anyone can get an underactive thyroid. An underactive thyroid can also be caused by: having another thyroid condition, such as thyroiditis surgery or radiotherapy around your neck or thyroid treatment for an overactive thyroid not getting enough iodine in your diet – this is rare in the UK treatment with certain medicines You're also more likely to have an underactive thyroid if others in your family have had a thyroid condition. Risks of an underactive thyroid An underactive thyroid is not usually serious if you're having the right treatment. If your underactive thyroid is not treated, or you're on the wrong dose of medicine, you may have an increased risk of getting: problems with your heart (including coronary heart disease and heart failure ) problems with your bones (including osteoporosis ) In very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. It's more common in older people. This is an emergency and requires treatment in hospital. An underactive thyroid and pregnancy If you have an underactive thyroid and are pregnant or planning to get pregnant, tell your GP. You'll need further tests and it's likely your dose of levothyroxine will need to change while you're pregnant. If it's not treated, an underactive thyroid can increase your chance or having serious complications in pregnancy, including high blood pressure ( pre-eclampsia ), birth defects, premature birth or miscarriage. Treatment usually helps prevent these complications, and the GP will talk to you about any risks. Help and support for an underactive thyroid As well as support from your doctor, you may find it helpful to get support from other people with an underactive thyroid. There are national charities that offer support and information for people with thyroid conditions including underactive thyroid.

Several treatments can help reduce the rate at which IPF gets worse, but there's currently no treatment that can stop or reverse the scarring of the lungs. Symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time. Symptoms can include: shortness of breath a persistent dry cough tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers) Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath. When to get medical advice See a GP if you have struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than 3 weeks. These symptoms are not normal and should not be ignored. If a GP thinks you could have a lung condition such as IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as: breathing (lung function) tests blood tests a chest X-ray and CT scan a lung biopsy , where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed Find out more about the tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis In people with IPF, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred. This causes the lungs to become stiff and makes it difficult for oxygen to get into the blood. The reason this happens is not clear. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown. IPF has been linked to: exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust viral infections a family history of IPF – around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition acid reflux smoking But it's not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF. Treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis There's currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression. Treatments include: self care measures, such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly medicines to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib breathing oxygen through a mask – you can do this while you're at home or while you're out and about exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily (pulmonary rehabilitation) a lung transplant – this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare Find out more about how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated Further information UK Charities Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis and the Pulmonary Fibrosis Trust provide information and support for people affected by IPF as well as news items about ongoing research into the condition. Outlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable. Some people respond well to treatment and remain relatively free of symptoms for many years, while others may get rapidly worse or find the breathlessness debilitating. Other problems can also sometimes develop, including chest infections , pulmonary hypertension and heart failure . It's very difficult to predict how long someone with IPF will survive at the time of diagnosis. Regular monitoring over time can indicate whether it's getting worse quickly or slowly. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If you have IPF, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS help scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat IPF. You can opt out of the register at any time.

With treatment, impetigo often gets better in a few days. Symptoms of impetigo Impetigo starts with red sores or blisters, but the redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin. The sores or blisters quickly burst and often leave crusty, golden-brown patches. The patches can: look a bit like cornflakes stuck to your skin get bigger and spread to other parts of your body be itchy and are sometimes painful The sores and blisters of impetigo commonly affect the face (around the nose and mouth) and hands.

If it's impetigo, they may prescribe: hydrogen peroxide cream antibiotic cream or tablets Babies and people with a weakened immune system may need antibiotic tablets to stop the infection causing more serious problems. If your impetigo keeps coming back A GP may take a swab from your skin to check for the bacteria that causes impetigo. They may also take a swab from inside your nose. They might prescribe an antiseptic body wash, nasal ointment, or both, to try to clear the bacteria and stop the impetigo coming back. Important: Make sure you finish treatment Do not stop using cream or taking antibiotic tablets early, even if the impetigo starts to clear up. How to stop impetigo spreading or getting worse Impetigo can be easily spread to other parts of your body or to other people through skin-to-skin contact. You can also get it by touching things that have been infected, like towels and bedding. Impetigo stops being contagious: 48 hours after you start using hydrogen peroxide cream or antibiotics prescribed by a pharmacist or GP when the patches dry out and crust over (if you do not get treatment) There are some things you can do to help stop impetigo spreading or getting worse while it's still contagious.

    "text": "Overview - Urinary incontinence Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Non-surgical treatment Surgery and procedures Incontinence products 10 ways to stop leaks Urinary incontinence is the unintentional passing of urine. It's a common problem thought to affect millions of people. There are several types of urinary incontinence, including: stress incontinence – when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure; for example, when you cough or laugh urge (urgency) incontinence – when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pee, or soon afterwards overflow incontinence (chronic urinary retention) – when you're unable to fully empty your bladder, which causes frequent leaking total incontinence – when your bladder cannot store any urine at all, which causes you to pass urine constantly or have frequent leaking It's also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence. Find out more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence . When to seek medical advice See a GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a common problem and you should not feel embarrassed talking to them about your symptoms. This can also be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with a GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may do a pelvic examination (if you have a vagina) or a rectal examination (if you have a penis). The GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate. You may also be referred to a specialist for more tests. Find out about diagnosing urinary incontinence . Causes of urinary incontinence Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening of or damage to the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter. Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscles, which control the bladder. Overflow incontinence is often caused by an obstruction or blockage in your bladder, which prevents it from emptying fully. Total incontinence may be caused by a problem with the bladder from birth, a spinal injury, or a small, tunnel like hole that can form between the bladder and a nearby area (fistula). Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence, including: pregnancy and vaginal birth obesity a family history of incontinence increasing age – although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing Find out more about the causes of urinary incontinence . Treating urinary incontinence Non-surgical treatments Initially, a GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include: lifestyle changes such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol pelvic floor exercises , where you strengthen your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them bladder training, where you learn ways to wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products , such as absorbent pads and handheld urinals. Medicine may be recommended if you're still unable to manage your symptoms. Find out more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence . Surgical treatments Surgery may also be considered. The procedures that are suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have. Surgical treatment for stress incontinence, such as a sling procedure, is used to reduce pressure on the bladder or strengthen the muscles that control urination. Surgery to treat urge incontinence includes enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles. Find out more about surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence . Preventing urinary incontinence It's not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it happening. These include: maintaining a healthy weight changing your drinking habits, including cutting down on alcohol doing pelvic floor muscle exercises Healthy weight Being obese can increase your risk of urinary incontinence. You may be able to lower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and healthy eating . Use the healthy weight calculator to see if you are a healthy weight for your height. Get more information and advice about managing your weight. Drinking habits Depending on your particular bladder problem, a GP can advise you about the amount of fluids you should drink. If you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to produce more urine and irritate your bladder. The recommended weekly limit for alcohol consumption is 14 units. A unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. Find out more about alcohol units . If you have to urinate frequently during the night (nocturia), try drinking less in the hours before you go to bed. However, make sure you still drink enough fluids during the day. Pelvic floor exercises Being pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow of urine from your bladder. If you're pregnant, strengthening your pelvic floor muscles may help prevent urinary incontinence. Find out more about pelvic floor muscle exercises during pregnancy. Everyone may benefit from strengthening their pelvic floor muscles with pelvic floor exercises. Find out more about pelvic floor exercises .

    "text": "Overview - Infertility Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Infertility is when a couple cannot get pregnant (conceive) despite having regular unprotected sex. Around 1 in 7 couples may have difficulty conceiving. More than 8 out of 10 couples, where the woman is under 40, will conceive naturally within a year if they have regular unprotected sex (every 2 or 3 days). For couples who have been trying to conceive for more than 3 years without success, the likelihood of getting pregnant naturally within the next year is 1 in 4, or less. Getting help Some people get pregnant quickly, but for others it can take longer. It's a good idea to see a GP if you have not conceived after a year of trying. Women aged 36 and over, and anyone who's already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner. They can check for common causes of fertility problems and suggest treatments that could help. Infertility is usually only diagnosed when a couple have not managed to conceive after a year of trying. There are 2 types of infertility: primary infertility – where someone who's never conceived a child in the past has difficulty conceiving secondary infertility – where someone has had 1 or more pregnancies in the past, but is having difficulty conceiving again Read more about how infertility is diagnosed . Treating infertility Fertility treatments include: medical treatment for lack of regular ovulation surgical procedures such as treatment for endometriosis, repair of the fallopian tubes, or removal of scarring (adhesions) within the womb or abdominal cavity assisted conception such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVF The treatment offered will depend on what's causing the fertility problems and what's available from your local integrated care board (ICB) . Private treatment is also available, but it can be expensive and there's no guarantee it will be successful. It's important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask a GP for advice, and should make sure you choose a clinic that's licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) . Some treatments for infertility, such as IVF, can cause complications. For example: multiple pregnancy – if more than 1 embryo is placed in the womb as part of IVF treatment there's an increased chance of having twins; this may not seem like a bad thing, but it significantly increases the risk of complications for you and your babies ectopic pregnancy – the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly increased if you have IVF Read more about how infertility is treated . What causes infertility? There are many possible causes of infertility , and fertility problems can affect either partner. But in a quarter of cases it is not possible to identify the cause. Common causes of infertility include: lack of regular ovulation (the monthly release of an egg) poor quality semen blocked or damaged fallopian tubes endometriosis – a condition where tissue, similar to the lining of the womb (the endometrium), grows in other places outside the womb Risk factors There are also several factors that can affect fertility. These include: age – fertility declines with age weight – being overweight or obese (having a BMI of 30 or over) reduces fertility; in women, being overweight or severely underweight can affect ovulation sexually transmitted infections (STIs) – several STIs , including chlamydia , can affect fertility smoking – can affect fertility: smoking (including passive smoking) affects your chance of conceiving and can reduce semen quality; read more about quitting smoking alcohol – the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking too much alcohol can also affect the quality of sperm (the chief medical officers for the UK recommend adults should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over 3 days or more) environmental factors – exposure to certain pesticides, solvents and metals has been shown to affect fertility, particularly in men stress – can affect your relationship with your partner and cause a loss of sex drive ; in severe cases, stress may also affect ovulation and sperm production Page last reviewed: 09 August 2023 Next review due: 09 August 2026 Next : Causes"

Removing stingers, ticks or caterpillars If anything is left on or in your skin, the first thing you need to do is remove it carefully. How to remove a bee, wasp or hornet stinger Brush or scrape the stinger sideways with your fingernail or the edge of a bank card. Do not use tweezers to pull out a stinger as you could squeeze poison out of it. Wash the area with soap and water. How to remove a tick Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool (if you have one), grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. Slowly pull upwards, taking care not to squeeze the tick or leave any of its mouth in your skin. Dispose of it when you've removed it. Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water.

Try not to disturb it as it'll release more hairs. Rinse your skin with running water and allow it to air dry. Use sticky tape on the skin to pick up any remaining hairs. Take off any jewellery in case your skin becomes swollen. Take off your clothes and wash them at a high temperature. Easing your symptoms If there's nothing in your skin, or you've removed it, wash your skin with soap and water to help lower the chance of infection.

    "text": "Insomnia Insomnia means you regularly have problems sleeping. It usually gets better by changing your sleeping habits. Symptoms of insomnia You have insomnia if you regularly: find it hard to go to sleep wake up several times during the night lie awake at night wake up early and cannot go back to sleep still feel tired after waking up find it hard to nap during the day even though you're tired feel tired and irritable during the day find it difficult to concentrate during the day because you're tired If you have insomnia for a short time (less than 3 months) it's called short-term insomnia. Insomnia that lasts 3 months or longer is called long-term insomnia. How much sleep you need Everyone needs different amounts of sleep. On average: adults need 7 to 9 hours children need 9 to 13 hours toddlers and babies need 12 to 17 hours You probably do not get enough sleep if you're constantly tired during the day. What causes insomnia The most common causes of insomnia are: stress, anxiety or depression noise a room that's too hot or cold uncomfortable beds alcohol, caffeine or nicotine illegal drugs like cocaine or ecstasy jet lag shift work Conditions and other things that can cause insomnia Conditions and medicines that can cause insomnia: mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease restless legs syndrome overactive thyroid menopause Many medicines can also cause insomnia. Things that keep you from getting a good night's sleep: long-term pain sleepwalking snoring or interrupted breathing while sleeping ( sleep apnoea ) suddenly falling asleep anywhere ( narcolepsy ) nightmares or night terrors (particularly in children) How you can treat insomnia yourself Insomnia usually gets better by changing your sleeping habits. Do go to bed and wake up at the same time every day relax at least 1 hour before bed, for example, take a bath or read a book make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet – use curtains, blinds, an eye mask or ear plugs if needed exercise regularly during the day make sure your mattress, pillows and covers are comfortable Don’t do not smoke or drink alcohol, tea or coffee at least 6 hours before going to bed do not eat a big meal late at night do not exercise at least 4 hours before bed do not watch television or use devices, like smartphones, right before going to bed, because the blue light makes you more awake do not nap during the day do not drive when you feel sleepy do not sleep in after a bad night's sleep and stick to your regular sleeping hours instead How a pharmacist can help with insomnia You can buy tablets or liquids (sometimes called sleeping aids) from a pharmacy that may help you sleep better. Some contain natural ingredients such as valerian or lavender, while others contain an antihistamine . They cannot cure insomnia but may help you sleep better for 1 to 2 weeks. They should not be taken for any longer. Some of these products can have side effects, for instance, they may make you drowsy. This could make it difficult for you to do certain things like drive. Check with your doctor before taking anything for your sleep problems. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: changing your sleeping habits has not helped your insomnia you've had trouble sleeping for months your insomnia is affecting your daily life in a way that makes it hard for you to cope Treatment from a GP for insomnia A GP will try to find out what's causing your insomnia so you get the right treatment. Sometimes you'll be offered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . This may be face-to-face with a therapist, or through an online self-help programme. This can help you change the thoughts and behaviours that keep you from sleeping. You may be referred to a sleep clinic if you have symptoms of another sleep disorder such as sleep apnoea. GPs now rarely prescribe sleeping pills to treat insomnia. Sleeping pills can have serious side effects and you can become dependent on them. Sleeping pills are only prescribed for a few days, or weeks at the most, if: your insomnia is very bad other treatments have not worked Page last reviewed: 19 March 2024 Next review due: 19 March 2027"

    "title": "Differences in sex development",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/differences-in-sex-development/",
    "text": "Differences in sex development Differences in sex development (DSD) is a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs, including genitals. It means a person's sex development is different to most other people's. Sometimes the term Disorders of Sex Development is used, as is Variations in Sex Characteristics (VSC) or Diverse Sex Development. Some people prefer to use the term intersex. Why does DSD happen? You or your child may have sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) usually associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or usually associated with being male (XY chromosomes), but reproductive organs and genitals that may look different from usual. This happens because of a difference with your genes or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body, or both. It can be inherited, but there is often no clear reason why it happens. The most common times to find out that a person has a DSD are around the time of their birth or when they're a teenager. Types of DSDs There are many different types of DSD. Some examples are: Usual female pattern genes with genitals that look different to girls' genitals Some people have XX (usual female) chromosomes with ovaries and a womb, but their genitals may not look the same as many females. For example, they may have a more developed clitoris and their vagina may be closed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD. The most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A person who has CAH lacks an enzyme (chemical substance) that their body needs to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Without these hormones, their body produces more androgens (sex hormones that are naturally higher in males). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth can cause their genitals to look different, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place. CAH can also cause serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible Find out more: The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children: CAH (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) Living with CAH - what is CAH? Genes usually seen in males with genitals that look the same as most girls' and some internal male structures Some people have XY (male) chromosomes, but their external genitals may develop in the usual way for girls or boys. Sometimes it's difficult at first to know whether their genitals are more similar to girls' or boys'. A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD. Many people with 46,XY DSD are boys born with the opening to pass urine towards the bottom of their penis or below it. For some, the scrotum appears separated into two smaller sacs, one on either side. Doctors call this peno-scrotal hypospadias and boys and men with this DSD can have either fully developed or partially developed testes. There are several causes of 46,XY DSD. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) , where the body \"ignores\" androgens or is insensitive to them. Sometimes a person's body does not respond at all or only partly responds to androgens. Complete insensitivity to androgens makes a person with XY chromosomes female. Partial insensitivity to androgens can mean that some people are male and others are female. Ordinary looking genitals but different sex development Some people have a chromosome pattern other than the usual XY or XX. They may have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY). Their internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through a full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods. Doctors call this sex chromosome DSD. One type is Klinefelter syndrome , which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). This can mean they do not produce the usual level of testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as the testes and body hair. Testosterone is also important for bone strength and fertility in men. Another example of this type of DSD is Turner syndrome , which is where a girl is born with a missing X chromosome. Girls and women with Turner syndrome are often infertile and their height may be shorter than average. Find out more: Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association Turner Syndrome Support Society - What is TS? Female with usual external genitals, but without a womb Some females are born with an underdeveloped womb or without a womb, cervix and upper vagina. The ovaries and external genitalia look the same as most girls and women and they develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older. This is called Rokitansky syndrome. It's also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome). The cause is not clear, but girls and women with Rokitansky syndrome/MRKH have XX chromosomes. Often the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex involving the vagina may also be difficult because the vagina may be shorter than most women's. Not having a womb means that a woman cannot become pregnant, but it's sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another woman's womb (surrogacy). You can find more support and information on Rokitansky syndrome at: DSD Teens – MRKH (a.k.a. Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome) MRKH Connect – What is MRKH Sex characteristics usually seen in males or females Some people with a very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis). Their genitals may appear female or male or could look different from either. Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes. The cause is not usually clear, but some people with the condition have been found to have genetic material that's usually seen on the Y chromosome appearing on their X chromosome. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD. What happens after the birth of a baby Doctors will check a baby for DSD soon after birth because of signs such as undescended testicles or if a baby's genitals look different. Tests may be done to help get a clear diagnosis and find out whether any immediate treatment is needed. Tests may include: a further physical examination of your baby done by a specialist an ultrasound scan to examine their internal organs blood tests to check their genes and hormone levels In England you need to register your baby’s birth within 42 days. This is usually enough time to complete the tests, discuss the results with your child’s care team and identify your baby’s sex. Many forms of DSD do not require any medical care other than understanding the baby's development and knowing what to expect as they grow older. A specialist nurse in your care team can help you learn about DSD and a psychologist will help you address any concerns you have. Find out more about what happens when your baby is born with genitals that look different, in the First Days leaflet. This is on the DSD Families Resources website page . Advice for parents of older children Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child does not go through puberty properly. For example, your child may not start showing the changes linked with puberty, or they may start puberty but not have periods. Speak to a GP if you have any concerns about your child's development at puberty. They can refer your child to a specialist. This will usually be a consultant paediatric endocrinologist, who specialises in hormones, or an adolescent gynaecologist. A team of specialist healthcare professionals will work with you to understand your child's condition and offer you and your child support and advice. A psychologist in the team can talk with you or your child about sexuality, relationships and body image among other subjects. Some people with DSD may need hormone therapy and psychological support. Some may want to think about altering their existing genitals, for example by using vaginal stretch techniques. Some people with DSD consider altering the appearance of their genitals by having surgery. If you think you have a DSD If you think or know you have a DSD, information and support is available. Speak to a GP, as they'll be able to refer you to a team of specialist healthcare professionals. They can answer your questions, help you stay healthy and put you in touch with others with DSD if that's something you're interested in. You can stay with the gender linked to your sex at birth, which is the sex on your birth certificate. But if your legal sex does not represent who you are or how you identify, you may want to discuss your options with your care team. If you have a DSD and want to explore parenthood, you can also discuss this with your specialist care team. Where to get support If you have a DSD or you're the parent of a child with a DSD, you may find it useful to contact a group involving others with the same or similar experiences. These groups can often offer more information and advice about living with a DSD, and may be able to put you in contact with others who've been in a similar situation to you. You are welcome to ask your care team about people with experience of your diagnosis in your local area who are happy to be contacted.

    "title": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/interstitial-cystitis/",
    "text": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis) Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a poorly understood condition where you have pelvic pain and problems peeing. It's sometimes called interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome. It's difficult to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis) as there is no single test that confirms the condition. Symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) The main symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) include: intense pelvic pain (felt over your lower tummy) sudden strong urges to pee needing to pee more often than usual pain in your lower tummy when your bladder is filling up, which is relieved when you pee waking up several times during the night to pee Other symptoms can include finding it difficult to pee, urinary incontinence and blood in your urine (haematuria). These symptoms can sometimes be caused by other conditions, such as cancer of the bladder. This is why you'll need a range of tests to rule out other possible causes before BPS (interstitial cystitis) can be diagnosed. Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you have blood in your urine and pain in your lower tummy. Blood in your pee may be bright pink, red or dark brown. Who gets BPS (interstitial cystitis) Although BPS (interstitial cystitis) can affect people of all ages, it's much more common in women than men, usually over the age of 30. The symptoms will often come and go over time. There may be times lasting days, weeks or months where your symptoms improve, followed by flare-ups when they're worse. You might also find the pain is worse during your period or after having certain foods or drinks. It can have a big impact on your everyday life, including work, mental health and relationships. But when a diagnosis is confirmed there are different treatments that can help. What causes interstitial cystitis? The exact cause of BPS (interstitial cystitis) is not clear. However, there are several ideas about what might cause it. These include: damage to the bladder lining, which may mean pee can irritate the bladder and surrounding nerves a problem with the pelvic floor muscles used to control peeing your immune system causing an inflammatory reaction Some people who have been diagnosed with BPS (interstitial cystitis), may have a long-term (chronic) urinary infection (UTI) in the bladder, which has not been picked up by current urine tests. BPS (interstitial cystitis) may also be associated with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia , myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . When to see a GP See a GP if: you have pelvic pain that does not go away you notice a change in your usual peeing pattern and it is affecting your daily life Ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have blood in your pee. What happens when you see a GP BPS (interstitial cystitis) can have similar symptoms to long-term or frequent UTIs, so the GP may give you a urine test to check for a UTI. Standard urine tests used in GP surgeries and hospitals may not pick up all infections of the bladder. You may be prescribed antibiotics to see if they help. A GP may also suggest simple treatments such as: keeping a food diary and avoiding foods and drinks that make your symptoms worse stopping smoking – chemicals in tobacco can irritate your bladder When to ask a GP for referral to a hospital specialist Treatments from the GP may not always work. If your symptoms keep coming back or do not go away, ask the GP to refer you to a urologist specialising in female urology or a urogynaecologist. Men may be referred to a urologist. How is BPS (interstitial cystitis) diagnosed? There is no single test to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis). You may have several tests to exclude other causes of your symptoms before a diagnosis can be confirmed. The tests offered may include: cystoscopy – a procedure to look inside your bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope urine tests ultrasound , MRI scan or CT scan of the urinary tract and sometimes of the kidneys too urodynamics – a range of tests to check the function of your bladder and urethra vaginal swabs Ask your doctor to explain what tests you are being offered and what they're for. Treatments for BPS (interstitial cystitis) When you have been diagnosed by a specialist as having BPS (interstitial cystitis), there are several treatments that may help. No single treatment works for everyone, and there is no conclusive evidence they work. You may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the treatments offered to you and why. Medicines Tablets or capsules may be used to treat people with BPS (interstitial cystitis). These include: over-the-counter painkillers – such as paracetamol and ibuprofen medicines for nerve pain – such as amitriptyline , gabapentin and pregabalin tolterodine , solifenacin or mirabegron – these can reduce the urgency to pee a prescription medicine that may help by blocking the effect of a substance called histamine in the bladder pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) – this may reduce pain (this can only be prescribed by a specialist as it's only suitable for some people) Bladder instillations Some medicines can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter . These are known as intravesical medicines or bladder instillations. Examples of intravesical medicines include: lignocaine - a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder, a mixture of compounds including steroids, sodium bicarbonate and heparin are used hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate – this may help restore the bladder lining antibiotics alone or combined with a local anaesthetic and steroid – this can calm inflammation and reduce infection As with oral medicines, the evidence is not conclusive for bladder instillations. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the different options. Supportive therapies and treatments Some people may also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful: physiotherapy – a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist can help you relax your muscles to ease pain. acupuncture – may help with pain relief talking therapies and counselling – to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your life transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your body pain management – ask the GP to refer you to a pain specialist Surgery and procedures Surgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments do not work. Procedures that may be carried out include: cauterisation – ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laser bladder distension – the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve symptoms botulinum toxin injections (such as Botox) – injected directly into your bladder wall to temporarily relieve symptoms of frequent peeing and pain. neuromodulation – an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to pee In very rare cases, and only as a last resort, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy). If this is done, your surgeon may need to create an alternative way for pee to leave your body. Things you can do to help BPS (interstitial cystitis) Things that may help improve your symptoms include: reducing stress – try exercise, warm baths and mindfulness-based meditation techniques making sure you are hydrated regularly throughout the day keeping a food diary – if you notice certain foods or drinks (like citrus fruits and alcohol) make symptoms worse, avoid them, but ask for medical advice first stopping smoking – the chemicals in cigarettes can irritate your bladder Information: More information and support Bladder Health UK has information and forums on BPS (interstitial cystitis), as well as other bladder conditions Page last reviewed: 18 February 2022 Next review due: 18 February 2025"

    "title": "Intracranial hypertension",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/intracranial-hypertension/",
    "text": "Intracranial hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) is a build-up of pressure around the brain. It can happen suddenly, for example, as the result of a severe head injury , stroke or ruptured brain aneurysm . It can be caused by a condition that affects your brain, such as a brain abscess , brain tumour , meningitis or encephalitis . IH can also develop as a complication of another condition such as high blood pressure . Treatment for these types of IH depends on the cause. Sometimes though there is no obvious reason why pressure builds up around the brain. Build-up of pressure with no known cause is known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This page is about idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Symptoms of intracranial hypertension Symptoms of intracranial hypertension (IH) can include: a constant throbbing headache which may be worse in the morning, or when coughing or straining; it may improve when standing up temporary loss of vision – your vision may become dark or \"greyed out\" for a few seconds at a time; this can be triggered by coughing, sneezing or bending down feeling and being sick feeling sleepy feeling irritable finding it difficult or painful to look at bright lights (photophobia) hearing a pulsing rhythmic noise in your ears (pulsatile tinnitus) problems with co-ordination and balance mental confusion loss of feeling or weakness Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if you have any of these symptoms and: they've come on quickly, such as a sudden severe headache, change in your vision, confusion or weakness you've recently had a head injury you have a high temperature, or you feel generally unwell Diagnosing intracranial hypertension A GP may suspect you have intracranial hypertension (IH) if you have symptoms of increased pressure on your brain, such as vision problems and headaches. If a GP thinks you have IH they'll refer you to a hospital specialist. You may have several different tests to diagnose IH, such as: an examination to check functions such as your muscle strength, reflexes and balance. Any problems could be a sign of an issue with your brain or nerves an assessment of your eyes and vision a CT scan or MRI scan of your brain a lumbar puncture , where a needle is inserted into your spine to check for high pressure in the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord Idiopathic IH may be diagnosed if you have increased pressure on your brain and no other cause can be found. Treatments for idiopathic intracranial hypertension Treatments for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IH) can include: losing weight if you're overweight. This can often help to reduce your symptoms and may sometimes relieve them altogether stopping any medicine that may be causing your symptoms medicine to remove excess fluid from the body (diuretics) medicine to reduce the production of cerebrospinal fluid in your brain a short course of steroid medicine to relieve headaches and reduce the risk of vision loss Surgery Surgery may be considered if other treatments do not help, particularly if your vision is getting worse or you're at risk of loss of vision. The main types of surgery for idiopathic IH are: shunt surgery – a thin, flexible tube is inserted into the fluid-filled space in your skull or spine to divert excess fluid to another part of your body optic nerve sheath fenestration – the protective layer surrounding your optic nerve (the nerve connecting the eye to the brain) is opened up to relieve pressure on it and allow fluid to drain away These procedures can provide relief from your symptoms, but they also carry a risk of potentially serious complications. Talk to the surgeon about what your operation involves and what the risks are. Risk factors for idiopathic intracranial hypertension While the cause, or causes, of idiopathic IH is unknown, a number of risk factors have been linked to the condition. It's a rare condition that mainly affects women in their 20s and 30s. It most often happens in women who have gained weight. The reason for this is unclear. Other factors that have been linked with idiopathic IH include: some hormone conditions such as hypoparathyroidism or Addison's disease taking certain medicines including some antibiotics , lithium (for mental health problems) and medicines for thyroid problems high levels of vitamin A a lack of red blood cells ( iron deficiency anaemia ) lupus – a problem with the immune system Complications of idiopathic intracranial hypertension Idiopathic IH is not usually life threatening, but it can be a lifelong problem. It can affect your vision, and there's a risk that you could lose your vision. This is because the increased pressure around the brain can cause swelling of the optic nerve. Treatment can help with problems with your vision and can reduce the risk of loss of vision. It's important to tell your doctor straight away if you notice any changes in your vision.

    "title": "Iron deficiency anaemia",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/",
    "text": "Iron deficiency anaemia Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by lack of iron, often because of blood loss or pregnancy. It's treated with iron tablets and by eating iron-rich foods. Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia can include: tiredness and lack of energy shortness of breath noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations) paler than usual skin headaches Less common symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia Less common symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia (that are not usually connected to pregnancy) include: hearing ringing, buzzing or hissing noises inside your head (tinnitus) food tasting strange feeling itchy a sore tongue hair loss – you notice more hair coming out when brushing or washing it wanting to eat non-food items, such as paper or ice (pica) finding it hard to swallow (dysphagia) painful open sores (ulcers) in the corners of your mouth nail changes, such as spoon-shaped nails restless legs syndrome Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have iron deficiency anaemia What happens at your appointment To check if you have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will ask you about your lifestyle and medical history. If the reason for the anaemia is not clear, they might order some tests to find out what might be causing the symptoms. They might also refer you to a specialist for further checks. Blood tests for iron deficiency anaemia The GP will usually order a full blood count (FBC) test. This will find out if the number of red blood cells you have (your red blood cell count ) is normal. You do not need to do anything to prepare for this test. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type of anaemia. There are other types, like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia , that the blood test will also check for. Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia Once the reason you have iron deficiency anaemia has been found (for example, an ulcer or heavy periods) the GP will recommend treatment. If the blood test shows your red blood cell count is low, iron tablets will be recommended to replace the iron that's missing from your body. You'll need to take them for about 6 months. Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron. Follow the GP's advice about how to take iron tablets. Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like: constipation or diarrhoea tummy pain heartburn feeling sick darker than usual poo Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects. It's important to keep taking the tablets, even if you get side effects. Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal. Important Keep iron supplement tablets out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron in a young child can be fatal. Things you can do to help with iron deficiency anaemia If your diet is partly causing your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you what foods are rich in iron so you can eat more of them. Eat more: dark-green leafy vegetables like watercress and curly kale cereals and bread with extra iron in them (fortified) meat dried fruit like apricots, prunes and raisins pulses (beans, peas and lentils) Eat and drink less: tea coffee milk and dairy foods with high levels of phytic acid, such as wholegrain cereals, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and tablets Large amounts of these foods and drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron. You might be referred to a specialist dietitian if you're finding it hard to include iron in your diet. Causes of iron deficiency anaemia Heavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medicine. In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet. Bleeding in the stomach and intestines is another common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This can be caused by: taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen and aspirin stomach ulcers inflammation of the bowel or food pipe (oesophagus) piles cancers of the bowel or stomach – but this is less common Any other conditions or actions that cause blood loss could also lead to iron deficiency anaemia. If iron deficiency anaemia is not treated Untreated iron deficiency anaemia: can make you more at risk of illness and infection – a lack of iron affects the immune system may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs – such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure can cause a greater risk of complications before and after birth if you're pregnant Page last reviewed: 26 January 2024 Next review due: 26 January 2027"

    "title": "Isovaleric acidaemia",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/isovaleric-acidaemia/",
    "text": "Isovaleric acidaemia Isovaleric acidaemia (IVA) is a rare, but potentially serious, inherited condition. It means the body can't process the amino acid leucine (amino acids are \"building blocks\" of protein). This causes a harmful build-up of the substance in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with IVA are unable to fully break down the amino acid leucine. Normally, leucine is broken down into a substance called isovaleric acid, which is then converted into energy. Babies with IVA don't have the enzyme that breaks down isovaleric acid, leading to a harmfully high level of this substance in the body. Diagnosing IVA At around 5 days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have IVA. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test. If IVA is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment includes a special diet, advice and sometimes medicine. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with IVA are able to live healthy lives. However, treatment for IVA must be continued for life. Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop in some children, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma . Some children with untreated IVA are also at risk of brain damage and developmental delay. Symptoms of IVA The symptoms of IVA aren't the same for everyone with the condition and some people may have more severe or frequent symptoms. Symptoms sometimes appear within the first few days or weeks after birth and may include: developing a distinctive odour of \"sweaty feet\" poor feeding or loss of appetite weight loss Babies with IVA may also have episodes known as a metabolic crisis. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include: lack of energy vomiting irritability sleepiness and non-responsiveness floppiness and falling over poor feeding breathing difficulties It's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which will help prevent these symptoms developing. Treating IVA Diet Children diagnosed with IVA are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of leucine your baby receives. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish milk and dairy products eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Breast milk and formula milk contain too much leucine for a baby with IVA to break down, so it should be measured and limited as advised by your dietitian. A protein-free baby formula can be given to replace the missing breast or baby milk. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. People with IVA need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Medicine Your child may be prescribed medicine to help clear some of the excess isovaleric acid. This will be either: L-carnitine glycine Sometimes, both medicines are prescribed to be taken together. Medicine for IVA needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. Both of these are taken by mouth. Emergency treatment If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold , their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill. Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medicine should still be taken as normal. Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn't feeding well while they are ill. If your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds, or develops repeated diarrhoea , contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you're heading straight to the A&E department . You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven't seen IVA before. Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein). You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties. How IVA is inherited The genetic change (mutation) responsible for IVA is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition. A baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father (known as autosomal recessive inheritance). If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of IVA and won't have the condition themselves. If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has: a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of IVA a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it's not possible to prevent IVA, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about you If you or your child has IVA, your clinical team will pass information about you/or them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the NCARDRS on GOV.UK .

    "text": "Overview - Newborn jaundice Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Kernicterus Jaundice in newborn babies is common and usually harmless. It causes yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. The medical term for jaundice in babies is neonatal jaundice. Yellowing of the skin can be more difficult to see in brown or black skin. It might be easier to see on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. Other symptoms of newborn jaundice can include: dark, yellow urine (a newborn baby's urine should be colourless) pale-coloured poo (it should be yellow or orange) The symptoms of newborn jaundice usually develop 2 days after the birth and tend to get better without treatment by the time the baby is about 2 weeks old. Find out more about the symptoms of jaundice in babies Your baby will be examined for signs of jaundice within 72 hours of being born as part of the newborn physical examination . If your baby develops signs of jaundice after this time, speak to your midwife, health visitor or a GP as soon as possible for advice. While jaundice is not usually a cause for concern, it's important to determine whether your baby needs treatment. If you're monitoring your baby's jaundice at home, it's also important to contact your midwife straight away if your baby's symptoms quickly get worse or they become very reluctant to feed. Find out more about diagnosing jaundice in babies Why does my baby have jaundice? Jaundice is caused by the build-up of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance produced when red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, are broken down. Jaundice is common in newborn babies because babies have a high number of red blood cells in their blood, which are broken down and replaced frequently. Also, a newborn baby's liver is not fully developed, so it's less effective at removing the bilirubin from the blood. By the time a baby is about 2 weeks old, their liver is more effective at processing bilirubin, so jaundice often corrects itself by this age without causing any harm. In a small number of cases, jaundice can be the sign of an underlying health condition. This is often the case if jaundice develops shortly after birth (within the first 24 hours). How common is newborn jaundice? Jaundice is one of the most common conditions that can affect newborn babies. It's estimated 6 out of every 10 babies develop jaundice, including 8 out of 10 babies born prematurely before the 37th week of pregnancy. But only around 1 in 20 babies has a blood bilirubin level high enough to need treatment. For reasons that are unclear, breastfeeding increases a baby's risk of developing jaundice, which can often persist for a month or longer. But in most cases, the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh any risks associated with jaundice. Treating newborn jaundice Treatment for newborn jaundice is not usually needed because the symptoms normally pass within 10 to 14 days, although they can occasionally last longer. Treatment is usually only recommended if tests show very high levels of bilirubin in a baby's blood. This is because there's a small risk the bilirubin could pass into the brain and cause brain damage. There are 2 main treatments that can be carried out in hospital to quickly reduce your baby's bilirubin levels. These are: phototherapy – a special type of light shines on the skin, which alters the bilirubin into a form that can be more easily broken down by the liver an exchange transfusion – where your baby's blood is removed using a thin tube (catheter) placed in their blood vessels and replaced with blood from a matching donor; most babies respond well to treatment and can leave hospital after a few days Complications If a baby with very high levels of bilirubin is not treated, there's a risk they could develop permanent brain damage. This is known as kernicterus. Kernicterus is very rare in the UK. Find out more about kernicterus in babies You can also read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance about jaundice in newborn babies under 28 days .

    "text": "Jet lag Jet lag is when your normal sleep pattern is disturbed after a long flight. It usually improves within a few days as your body adjusts to the new time zone. Ways to reduce jet lag Jet lag cannot be prevented, but there are things you can do to reduce its effects. Get plenty of rest before you travel. You could start going to bed and getting up earlier or later than usual (more like the time zone of the place you're travelling to). During your flight Do drink plenty of water keep active by stretching and regularly walking around the cabin try to sleep if it's night time at your destination use an eye mask and earplugs if they help you sleep Don’t do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they can make jet lag worse After you arrive Do change your sleep schedule to the new time zone as quickly as possible set an alarm to avoid oversleeping in the morning go outside during the day – natural light will help your body clock adjust Don’t do not sleep during the day – only sleep at night time Information: Short trips If your trip is short (2 to 3 days), you could try not changing your eating and sleeping times to the new time zone, to avoid needing to change your schedule again when you get back. Treatment for jet lag Medicines are not usually needed for jet lag. Jet lag often improves after a few days as your body clock adjusts to the new time zone. Sleeping tablets may be helpful if you're having problems sleeping ( insomnia ). But they can be addictive so should only be used for a short time and if symptoms are severe. Melatonin is a natural hormone released by the body in the evening to let your brain know it's time to sleep. Melatonin tablets are not recommended on the NHS for jet lag because there's not enough evidence to show they work. Symptoms of jet lag The main symptoms of jet lag are: difficulty sleeping at bedtime and waking up in the morning tiredness and exhaustion difficulty staying awake during the day poor sleep quality concentration and memory problems Jet lag can also sometimes cause indigestion , feeling sick (nausea) , constipation , changes in appetite and mild anxiety.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/",
    "text": "Joint hypermobility syndrome Joint hypermobility syndrome is when you have very flexible joints (you may think of yourself as being double-jointed). It usually affects children and young people and often gets better as you get older. Symptoms of joint hypermobility syndrome You or your child may have joint hypermobility syndrome if you: often get tired, even after rest keep getting pain and stiffness in your joints or muscles keep getting sprains and strains keep dislocating your joints (they \"pop out\") have poor balance or co-ordination have thin, stretchy skin have bladder or bowel problems Some people with joint hypermobility syndrome do not have symptoms. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you or your child have joint hypermobility syndrome What happens at your GP appointment The GP will usually test for joint hypermobility syndrome by checking the flexibility of your joints using a test called the Beighton scoring system. They may also refer you for a blood test or X-ray to help rule out any other conditions, like arthritis. Information: Find out more about assessing joint hypermobility using the Beighton scoring system on the Ehlers-Danlos Society website Treating joint hypermobility syndrome There's no cure for joint hypermobility syndrome. The main treatment is improving muscle strength and fitness so your joints are better protected. A GP may refer you to a physiotherapist, occupational therapist or podiatrist for specialist advice. You can also pay for these services privately. These physical therapies can help to: reduce pain and the risk of dislocations improve muscle strength and fitness improve your posture and balance Find physiotherapy services Treating joint pain Paracetamol and anti-inflammatory painkillers (like ibuprofen , which comes as tablets, gels and sprays) may help to ease pain. Speak to a pharmacist about the best painkiller for you. A GP may be able to prescribe stronger painkillers. If you're in severe pain, a GP may be able to refer you to a pain clinic to help you cope with pain. To help ease joint pain and stiffness, you can: have warm baths use hot water bottles use heat-rub cream Find a pharmacy Joint care you can do yourself If you have joint hypermobility syndrome, there are things you can do to improve joint and muscle strength and reduce strain. Do gentle exercise – start with low-impact exercise like swimming or cycling if you've not been active before (not doing any exercise can make your symptoms worse) maintain a healthy weight wear supportive shoes wear special insoles (orthotics) in your shoes if a podiatrist has recommended them Don’t do not overextend your joints just because you can do not do repetitive exercises or activities – take regular breaks (called pacing) What causes joint hypermobility syndrome Joint hypermobility syndrome can run in families and it cannot be prevented. Usually, the joints are loose and stretchy because the ligaments that should make them stronger and support them are weak. The weakness is because the collagen that strengthens the ligaments is different from other people's. Most experts agree that joint hypermobility syndrome is part of a spectrum of hypermobility disorders which includes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome .

Read more about diagnosing Kawasaki disease . It's not clear exactly what causes Kawasaki disease. It may be due to a combination of factors. Read more about the possible causes of Kawasaki disease . Treating Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease is always treated in hospital. It's best if treatment begins as soon as possible. The sooner treatment starts, the quicker the recovery time and there's less risk of complications developing. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a solution of antibodies, and aspirin are the 2 main medicines used to treat Kawasaki disease. Read more about treating Kawasaki disease . Complications of Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease causes the blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen, which can lead to complications in the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). Without treatment, around 1 in 4 children with Kawasaki disease get heart complications. This can be fatal in about 2 to 3% of cases. Because of this, Kawasaki disease is one of the main causes of acquired heart disease in children under 5 in the UK. Acquired heart disease develops after birth. Read more about the complications of Kawasaki disease . Who's affected Around 8 in every 100,000 children develop Kawasaki disease in the UK each year. Research carried out in England from 1998 to 2003 found 72% of children with Kawasaki disease were under the age of 5. The condition was also shown to be 1.5 times more common in boys than girls.

If your child has a rash and you're not sure it's keratosis pilaris, see more about rashes in babies and children . Things you can do yourself to help Most people with keratosis pilaris have it for years, and it may eventually clear up by itself. There are things you can do to help improve the appearance of your skin. Do moisturise your skin – ask a pharmacist what's most suitable for you use mild and unperfumed soaps and bathing products gently scrub your skin with a washcloth or exfoliating mitt have cool or lukewarm showers and baths Don’t do not use perfumed soaps or bathing products that can dry out your skin do not use harsh scrubs on your skin – this can make it worse do not have hot baths or showers do not scratch, pick or rub your skin A pharmacist can help with keratosis pilaris Speak to a pharmacist if: things you try yourself are not helping your keratosis pilaris and the condition is bothering you your skin becomes itchy or inflamed you're not sure if you need to see a GP A pharmacist can recommend creams or lotion to help your skin. They can also tell you if you need to see a GP. Other treatments Other treatments available for keratosis pilaris include steroid creams and laser treatments. These types of treatments are not usually available on the NHS because they have not been proven to be effective, and they can be expensive to pay for privately. Causes of keratosis pilaris Keratosis pilaris happens when your hair follicles become blocked with a build-up of keratin, a substance found in skin, hair and nails. Nobody knows exactly why keratin builds up, but the condition is thought to run in families. So if your parents have it, you may get it too. Keratosis pilaris is not infectious, so you cannot spread or catch it. Page last reviewed: 04 July 2024 Next review due: 04 July 2027 Some images provided by Dermatology Atlas ."

    "text": "Overview - Chronic kidney disease Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Living with Prevention Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should. It's a common condition often associated with getting older. It can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are black or of south Asian origin. CKD can get worse over time and eventually the kidneys may stop working altogether, but this is uncommon. Many people with CKD are able to live long lives with the condition. Symptoms of CKD There are usually no symptoms of kidney disease in the early stages. It may only be diagnosed if you have a blood or urine test for another reason and the results show a possible problem with your kidneys. At a more advanced stage, symptoms can include: tiredness swollen ankles, feet or hands shortness of breath feeling sick blood in your pee (urine) See a GP if you have persistent or worrying symptoms that you think could be caused by kidney disease. Find out more about the symptoms of CKD . Causes of CKD Chronic kidney disease is usually caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. Often it's the result of a combination of different problems. CKD can be caused by: high blood pressure – over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly kidney infections glomerulonephritis – kidney inflammation autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease – an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys blockages in the flow of urine – for example, from kidney stones that keep coming back, or an enlarged prostate long-term, regular use of certain medicines – such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) You can help prevent CKD by making healthy lifestyle changes and ensuring any underlying conditions you have are well controlled. Tests for CKD CKD can be diagnosed using blood and urine tests. These tests look for high levels of certain substances in your blood and urine that are signs your kidneys are not working properly. If you're at a high risk of developing kidney disease (for example, you have a known risk factor such as high blood pressure or diabetes), you may be advised to have regular tests to check for CKD so it's found at an early stage. The results of your blood and urine tests can be used to tell the stage of your kidney disease. This is a number that reflects how severe the damage to your kidneys is, with a higher number indicating more serious CKD. Find out more about how CKD is diagnosed . Treatments for CKD There's no cure for CKD, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse. Your treatment will depend on how severe your condition is. The main treatments are: lifestyle changes to help you remain as healthy as possible medicine to control associated problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol dialysis – treatment to replicate some of the kidney's functions; this may be necessary in advanced CKD kidney transplant – this may also be necessary in advanced CKD You'll also be advised to have regular check-ups to monitor your condition. Find out more about how CKD is treated and living with CKD . Outlook for CKD CKD can range from a mild condition with no or few symptoms, to a very serious condition where the kidneys stop working, sometimes called kidney failure. Most people with CKD will be able to control their condition with medicine and regular check-ups. CKD only progresses to kidney failure in around 2 in 100 people with the condition. If you have CKD, even if it's mild, you're at an increased risk of developing other serious problems, such as cardiovascular disease . This is a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, which includes heart attack and stroke . Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in people with kidney disease, although healthy lifestyle changes and medicine can help reduce your risk of developing it. Want to know more?

    "text": "Kidney infection A kidney infection is a painful type of urinary tract infection that can affect one or both kidneys. It can be serious if it's not treated. Symptoms of a kidney infection Symptoms of a kidney infection can include: a high temperature feeling or being sick pain in your lower back or side diarrhoea aching muscles and flu-like symptoms pain, burning or stinging when you pee needing to pee more often and urgently than usual pee that's dark or cloudy Symptoms in young children may also include: wetting the bed or themselves being drowsy A child under 2 years may only have a high temperature. The symptoms may be similar to symptoms of other urinary tract infections (UTIs), such as cystitis . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if you or your child have: pain, burning or stinging when you pee needing to pee more often and urgently than usual pee that's dark or cloudy kidney infection symptoms that have not gone away after treatment with antibiotics Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You think you or your child may have a kidney infection and: have a very high temperature, or feel hot and shivery have a very low temperature below 36C have pain in the lower tummy or in the back, just under the ribs have blood in your pee are feeling or being sick have not had a pee all day you are pregnant A kidney infection can be serious if it's not treated as it can cause sepsis . Call 111 or get help from 111 online if you cannot speak to or see a GP, or your symptoms are getting worse. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if: you are confused, drowsy or have difficulty speaking Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatment for a kidney infection Treatment from a GP If the GP thinks you have a kidney infection, you'll have your pee tested to check. The main treatment for a kidney infection is antibiotic tablets, which you'll usually take for 7 to 14 days. You'll usually feel better after about 2 weeks. People who are older or have underlying conditions may take longer to recover. Treatment in hospital Some people are more vulnerable to the effects of an infection. If you have a long-term health condition, or you're pregnant, you may need to go to hospital to have antibiotics through a drip. This works faster than tablets. In hospital, you'll have regular blood and urine tests to check your health and to make sure the antibiotics are working. Most people are well enough to go home after 3 to 7 days. Things you can do to help kidney infection symptoms There are some things you can try to ease kidney infection symptoms while you're having treatment. They can also help prevent a kidney infection coming back. Do rest – it can take up to 2 weeks before you feel able to return to work drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash – take small sips if you feel sick take paracetamol to reduce a high temperature and relieve pain give your child liquid paracetamol for children if they're distressed or uncomfortable – check the packaging or leaflet to make sure the medicine is suitable for your child, or speak to a pharmacist or GP if you're not sure ask your doctor how much fluid you can drink if you have kidney problems always try to fully empty your bladder when you pee Don’t do not take ibuprofen unless advised by a doctor – it may increase your risk of further kidney problems do not hold your pee in if you feel the urge to go Causes of kidney infections A kidney infection is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are caused by bacteria in the tube that carries pee out of your body (uretha). A kidney infection is often caused by cystitis, another type of UTI. But you can also have one without having cystitis. You may be more likely to get a kidney infection if you have a problem with your kidney, such as kidney stones, or if you have certain conditions or a weakened immune system. UTIs and kidney infections are more common in women, but anyone can get one. Page last reviewed: 13 February 2025 Next review due: 13 February 2028"

They're quite common, with more than 1 in 10 people affected. Kidney stones are usually found in the kidneys or in the ureter, the tube that connects the kidneys to your bladder. They can be extremely painful, and can lead to kidney infections or the kidney not working properly if left untreated. Symptoms of kidney stones You may not notice if you have small kidney stones. You'll usually pee them out without any discomfort.

This is more likely to happen if you: do not drink enough fluids are taking some types of medication have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine Find out more about the causes of kidney stones After a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you pee. Treating and preventing kidney stones Most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your pee, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication. Larger stones may need to be broken up or removed with surgery.

To avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day so you do not become dehydrated . It's very important to keep your urine pale in colour to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones. Find out more about preventing kidney stones The kidneys The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs that are roughly 10cm (4 inches) in length. They're located towards the back of the abdomen on either side of the spine. The kidneys remove waste products from the blood. The clean blood is then transferred back into the body and the waste products are passed out of the body when you pee. Video: what are kidney stones?

    "title": "Klinefelter syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/klinefelters-syndrome/",
    "text": "Klinefelter syndrome Klinefelter syndrome (sometimes called Klinefelter's, KS or XXY) is where boys and men are born with an extra X chromosome. Chromosomes are packages of genes found in every cell in the body. There are 2 types of chromosome, called the sex chromosomes, that determine the genetic sex of a baby. These are named either X or Y. Usually, a female baby has 2 X chromosomes (XX) and a male has 1 X and 1 Y (XY). But in Klinefelter syndrome, a boy is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome (XXY). The X chromosome is not a \"female\" chromosome and is present in everyone. The presence of a Y chromosome denotes male sex. Boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome are still genetically male, and often will not realise they have this extra chromosome, but occasionally it can cause problems that may require treatment. Symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome Klinefelter syndrome does not usually cause any obvious symptoms early in childhood, and even the later symptoms may be difficult to spot. Many boys and men do not realise they have it. Possible features, which are not always present, may include: in babies and toddlers – weak muscles and very flexible (hypermobile) joints, learning to sit up, crawl, walk and talk later than usual, being quieter and more passive than usual, having undescended testicles, only one testicle, or a smaller penis in childhood – shyness and low self-confidence, problems with reading, writing, spelling and paying attention, mild dyslexia or dyspraxia , low energy levels, and difficulty socialising or expressing feelings in teenagers – growing taller than expected for the family (with long arms and legs), broad hips, poor muscle tone and slower than usual muscle growth, reduced facial and body hair that starts growing later than usual, small, firm testes, and enlarged breasts ( gynaecomastia ) in adulthood – inability to have children naturally (infertility) , low sex drive , small, firm testes, and erection problems. Health issues in Klinefelter syndrome Many boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome will not be significantly affected and can live normal, healthy lives. Infertility tends to be the main problem, although there are treatments that can help. But men with Klinefelter syndrome are at a slightly increased risk of developing other health problems, including: type 2 diabetes weak and fragile bones (osteoporosis) cardiovascular disease and blood clots autoimmune disorders (where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body), such as lupus an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) anxiety , learning difficulties and depression – although intelligence is usually unaffected male breast cancer – although this is very rare These problems can usually be treated if they do occur and testosterone replacement therapy may help reduce the risk of some of them. Causes of Klinefelter syndrome Klinefelter syndrome is caused by an additional X chromosome. This chromosome carries extra copies of genes, which may interfere with the development of the testicles and mean they produce less testosterone (male sex hormone) than usual. The extra genetic information may either be carried in every cell in the body or it may only affect some cells (known as mosaic Klinefelter syndrome). Klinefelter syndrome is not directly inherited – the additional X chromosome occurs as a result of either the mother's egg or the father's sperm having the extra X chromosome (an equal chance of this happening in either), so after conception the chromosome pattern is XXY rather than XY. This change in the egg or sperm seems to happen randomly. If you have a son with the condition, the chances of this happening again are very small. The risk of a woman having a son with Klinefelter syndrome may be slightly higher if the mother or father are older. Testing for Klinefelter syndrome See your GP if you have concerns about your son's development or you notice any symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome in yourself or your son. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent health problems in the future. Treatment can help reduce some of the symptoms if necessary. In many cases, it's only detected if a man with the condition undergoes fertility tests. Your GP may suspect Klinefelter syndrome after a physical examination and may suggest sending off a sample of blood to check reproductive hormone levels. The diagnosis can be confirmed by checking a sample of blood for the presence of the extra X chromosome. Klinefelter syndrome can also be picked up as part of some screening tests during pregnancy. Treatments for Klinefelter syndrome There's no cure for Klinefelter syndrome, but some of the problems associated with the condition can be treated if necessary. Possible treatments include: testosterone replacement therapy speech and language therapy during childhood to help with speech development educational and behavioural support at school to help with any learning difficulties or behaviour problems occupational therapy to help with any co-ordination problems associated with dyspraxia physiotherapy to help build muscle and increase strength psychological support for any mental health issues fertility treatment – options include artificial insemination using donor sperm or possibly intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) , where sperm removed during a small operation are used to fertilise an egg in a laboratory breast reduction surgery to remove excess breast tissue Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) TRT involves taking medicines containing testosterone. It can be taken in the form of gels or tablets in children, or given as gel or injections in adult men. TRT may be considered once puberty begins and may help with the development of a deep voice, facial and body hair, an increase in muscle mass, reduction in body fat, and improvement in energy. There is also evidence that it can help with learning and behavioural problems. You should see a specialist in children's hormones (a paediatric endocrinologist) at this time. Long-term treatment during adulthood may also help with several other problems associated with Klinefelter syndrome – including osteoporosis, low mood, reduced sex drive, low self-esteem and low energy levels – although it cannot reverse infertility. TRT may be stopped during fertility treatment, or not started until after fertility treatment. Treatment with TRT will be monitored by your care team as it can cause side effects and health issues. Lifestyle changes Leading a healthy lifestyle, including eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, can help reduce your chances of getting conditions like type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. It can also help with your mental health, including depression and anxiety. Try to quit smoking and try to not drink more alcohol than the recommended limit of 14 units of alcohol a week, spread across 3 days. More information and support If you or your son has been diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, you might find it useful to find out more about it and get in touch with others affected by it.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kyphosis/",
    "text": "Overview - Kyphosis Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Kyphosis is curvature of the spine that causes the top of the back to appear more rounded than normal. Everyone has some degree of curvature in their spine. However, a curve of more than 45 degrees is considered excessive. Sometimes kyphosis doesn't cause any symptoms other than the back appearing abnormally curved or hunched. However, in some cases the condition causes: back pain and stiffness tenderness of the spine tiredness Back pain can be particularly problematic in adults with kyphosis because the body has to compensate for the spinal abnormality. If you have severe kyphosis, your symptoms may get worse over time. You may also have difficulty breathing and eating. What causes kyphosis? In kyphosis, the normal curve in the middle section of vertebral column (the thoracic vertebrae) is more curved than normal. There are a number of reasons why this might happen, including: poor posture (postural kyphosis) – slouching, leaning back in chairs and carrying heavy bags can stretch supporting muscles and ligaments, which can increase spinal curvature abnormally shaped vertebrae (Scheuermann's kyphosis) – if the vertebrae don't develop properly, they can end up being out of position abnormal development of the spine in the womb (congenital kyphosis) – if something disrupts the spine's normal development, two or more vertebrae sometimes fuse together age – as people get older, their spinal curvature can increase Kyphosis can also develop as a result of a spinal injury. Read more about the causes of kyphosis . Treating kyphosis If you have kyphosis, your treatment depends on how curved your spine is, whether you have any additional symptoms such as back pain, and the underlying causes. Children with kyphosis may be able to be treated using non-surgical methods, such as bracing, to limit the progression of kyphosis as they grow. Treatment for mild kyphosis may not be necessary. Kyphosis rarely requires surgical treatment. It's only needed in some severe cases to correct the curvature of the spine. Read more about treatment for kyphosis . Emotional issues Older children with kyphosis may become concerned or embarrassed about the effect the condition has on their appearance, or having to wear a back brace. These concerns can affect different children in different ways. Some children can become socially withdrawn and may be reluctant to take part in activities, such as PE, where their condition may be exposed. There are no easy answers to these problems, but it can sometimes help to reassure your child that their feelings will improve with time. Complications Complications of kyphosis usually only occur in more severe cases. They include: persistent pain breathing difficulties caused by the spine compressing the lungs and airways Occasionally, people with kyphosis can have difficulties when the nerves running through the spine become compressed or pinched. This can disrupt nerve signals and cause symptoms such as: numbness or weakness in the arms and legs problems with sense of balance loss of normal bladder or bowel control These serious complications require urgent medical attention and surgery would usually be recommended. Can kyphosis be prevented? Postural kyphosis can be prevented by being aware of your posture and by taking care of your back. You should encourage your child to: avoid slouching sit correctly – sit upright, ensuring that all of the back is supported avoid carrying heavy schoolbags and if using backpacks ensure they are well designed and used properly take regular exercise to help strengthen the back and keep it flexible; activities such as swimming, running, walking and yoga are ideal for helping to prevent back problems Further information: Physical activity guidelines for children under 5 years of age Physical activity guidelines for children and young people Page last reviewed: 12 May 2022 Next review due: 12 May 2025 Next : Causes"

Causes of labial fusion It's not certain what causes labial fusion, but it may happen as a result of irritation or inflammation of the vaginal area, known as vaginitis. This can cause the inner lips of the vulva to become sticky. Without enough oestrogen in the body, which is quite normal before puberty, the lips can stay stuck together and gradually become firmly joined. The problem is rarely seen in girls after they begin puberty because this is when they start to produce the hormone oestrogen. Labial fusion can also sometimes happen after childbirth or after the menopause, when oestrogen levels are also low. Seeing a GP For most babies or girls, labial fusion does not cause any problems and is often discovered accidentally by a parent or carer during nappy changing or bathing. The GP can confirm labial fusion after doing a routine examination of the child's genital area. Treating labial fusion A labial fusion or adhesion usually separates naturally without treatment. Treatment for labial fusion is not recommended unless there are other symptoms, such as dribbling after peeing, which may cause problems or discomfort. If labial fusion is causing problems for your child, their doctor may prescribe oestrogen cream or ointment to help the membranes dissolve. You'll be given information on how to apply it and how long to use it for. Very rarely, surgery may be recommended. Surgery Surgery is very rarely needed to treat labial fusion. It may be considered if: an oestrogen cream or ointment does not work there's trapped pee in the vagina, which can dribble out after peeing and cause vulval soreness Labial fusions are relatively easy to separate during surgery. A doctor can usually gently pull them apart by hand, or by using a small blunt probe. A surgical separation is usually performed under a general anaesthetic , where you're asleep, or local anaesthetic , where the area is numbed, as the procedure can be quite painful and can cause distress. To allow the labial edges to heal properly and prevent another labial fusion forming, it's advised to apply an emollient, such as nappy rash cream or Vaseline, to the labia for a few weeks afterwards. There's a high chance the fusion will return after treatment, whether it's with oestrogen cream or surgery. Complications of labial fusion Labial fusion is not linked to any medical condition and has no long-term implications for your child. It will not affect her future fertility or sexual life. In most cases, a fusion corrects itself during puberty. In up to 1 in 7 of cases, a fusion may come back, but this tendency usually stops before puberty begins. Rarely, labial fusion can cause: infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) soreness or pain in the genital area pee becoming trapped in the vagina, leading to pee leaking between visits to the toilet Video: labial fusion in children This video explains what labial fusion is and gives advice on where to seek help.

    "text": "Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis are types of inner ear infection that affect your balance. They usually get better on their own within a few weeks. Symptoms of labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis The most common symptoms of labyrinthitis are: dizziness or feeling that everything around you is spinning ( vertigo ) feeling unsteady and off balance – you might find it difficult to stay upright or walk in a straight line feeling or being sick hearing loss ringing in your ears ( tinnitus ) The symptoms of vestibular neuritis are very similar, but it does not cause hearing loss or tinnitus. Symptoms can start suddenly. They may be there when you wake up and get worse as the day goes on. The symptoms often ease after a few days. You'll usually get your balance back over 2 to 6 weeks, although it can take longer. Things you can do to help Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis usually gets better on its own. But there are things you can do to ease the symptoms. Do lie still in a dark room if you feel very dizzy drink plenty of water if you're being sick – it's best to drink little and often try to avoid noise and bright lights try to get enough sleep – tiredness can make symptoms worse start to go for walks outside as soon as possible – it may help to have someone with you to steady you until you become confident when you're out and about, keep your eyes focused on a fixed object, rather than looking around all the time Don’t do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you feel dizzy do not drink alcohol – it can make symptoms worse Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis that do not get better after a few days or are getting worse you've been diagnosed with labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis and your symptoms have not improved within a week of starting treatment The GP may refer you to a hospital specialist. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have sudden hearing loss in 1 ear You may need to be referred to a specialist for tests, and possibly treatment. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Information: Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis – what's the difference? Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis are problems with different parts of the inner ear, which are needed for balance: labyrinthitis is inflammation of the labyrinth – a maze of fluid-filled channels in the inner ear vestibular neuritis is inflammation of the vestibular nerve – the nerve in the inner ear that sends messages to the brain The symptoms of vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis are very similar. However, if your hearing is affected, then labyrinthitis is the cause. This is because inflammation of the labyrinth affects hearing, while inflammation of the vestibular nerve does not. Treatment from a GP for labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis If you have labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis, a GP may prescribe antihistamines or motion sickness tablets for up to 3 days. Do not take them for any longer, as they can slow down your recovery. Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis is usually caused by a viral infection, such as a cold or flu, so antibiotics will not help. But a GP may prescribe antibiotics if they think your infection is bacterial. Exercises for long-term balance problems Sometimes, balance problems can last for much longer – for many months or even years. Vestibular rehabilitation is a series of exercises that can help restore balance. You should only do the exercises under the supervision of a specialist such as a physiotherapist or audiologist. You can ask a GP to refer you to a physiotherapist, or it may be possible to refer yourself directly. Waiting lists for accessing NHS physiotherapy can be long and you may prefer to pay for private treatment. Most private physiotherapists accept direct self-referrals.

    "text": "Lactose intolerance Lactose intolerance is when you get symptoms, such as tummy pain, after eating food containing lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. The symptoms can be prevented by eating smaller portions of foods that contain lactose or avoiding them completely. Symptoms of lactose intolerance Symptoms of lactose intolerance can start a few minutes, or a few hours, after having food or drink containing lactose. Common symptoms include: tummy pain or discomfort bloating farting diarrhoea or constipation feeling sick or being sick You may also have longer lasting symptoms including a rash ( eczema ), headaches, joint pain, feeling tired, and finding it hard to concentrate. Foods that contain lactose Lactose is found in foods containing animal milk (dairy products), includes milk from cows, goats and sheep. Dairy products include: milk butter cheese cream yoghurt ice cream Many processed foods can also contain lactose, including: cereals baked foods like bread, crackers, cakes, biscuits, and pastry sauces and salad dressings diet and protein shakes Find out more about lactose intolerance and checking food labels on the Allergy UK website. Information: Food allergy A food intolerance is different from having a food allergy , which can cause symptoms such as struggling to breathe, itchy skin, and swelling of the lips, face and eyes. A food allergy can be life threatening. Non-urgent advice: See your GP if: You have symptoms of lactose intolerance and: your symptoms keep coming back and often happen after eating you've noticed changes in your poo that are not usual for you, such as looser poo, pooing more often, or constipation for 3 weeks you've have blood in your poo for 3 weeks you've had tummy bloating and discomfort for 3 weeks you've been losing weight Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air) your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet) you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy someone faints and cannot be woken up a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face) You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised or itchy. These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital. Tests for lactose intolerance If your GP thinks you have lactose intolerance, you may: be asked to follow a lactose elimination diet – where you stop eating foods containing lactose to see if your symptoms improve have blood tests do a hydrogen breath test – where hydrogen gas in your breath is measured to find out how well you digest lactose If your symptoms are severe and do not get better, you may need a gastroscopy . This is where a long, thin, flexible tube is passed into your mouth and down into your stomach. A very small sample of cells may be taken from your small intestine so it can be tested. Before the test, you may be given painkillers to help with any discomfort, and a sedative to help you relax. Treatment for lactose intolerance For most people with lactose intolerance, the symptoms can be prevented by reducing the amount of food you eat that contains lactose, or by avoiding these foods completely. If you think your child is lactose intolerant, see your GP before removing dairy products from their diet. Taking a lactase supplement before having food or drink containing lactose may reduce or prevent symptoms for some people. In some people, lactose intolerance is caused by another health condition, such as coeliac disease. Treating the underlying cause should help. Causes of lactose intolerance The most common cause of lactose intolerance is when the body does not make enough of an enzyme called lactase, which helps you digest lactose. Lactose intolerance can start at any age and can also be caused by: conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and Coeliac disease bowel infections bowel surgery an injury to the bowel Some premature babies are unable to digest lactose because their bowel has not developed enough, but this usually gets better as your baby gets older. Some people do not make any lactase at all, but this is very rare. Page last reviewed: 05 January 2023 Next review due: 05 January 2026"

    "text": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare condition that affects the signals sent from the nerves to the muscles. It means the muscles are unable to tighten (contract) properly, resulting in muscle weakness and a range of other symptoms. More than half of LEMS cases occur in middle-aged or older people with lung cancer . The remaining cases are not associated with cancer and can start at any age. LEMS is also known as myasthenic syndrome or Eaton-Lambert syndrome. Symptoms of LEMS The symptoms of LEMS develop gradually over weeks or months. The main symptoms are weakness in the legs, arms, neck and face, as well as problems with automatic body functions, such as controlling blood pressure. Common symptoms include: aching muscles feeling very tired all the time (fatigue) difficulty walking and climbing stairs difficulty lifting objects or raising the arms drooping eyelids, dry eyes and blurred vision swallowing problems dizziness upon standing a dry mouth constipation erectile dysfunction muscle weakness that gets worse with time See a GP if you have a combination of these symptoms. Causes of LEMS LEMS is caused by the body's natural defences (the immune system) mistakenly attacking and damaging the nerves. Normally, nerve signals travel down the nerves and stimulate the nerve endings to release a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical then helps activate the muscles. If the nerve endings are damaged, the amount of acetylcholine they produce decreases, which means nerve signals do not reach the muscles properly. It's not known what triggers the immune system to attack the nerves. It's often associated with lung cancer, but can occur in people without cancer. Tests for LEMS The GP will first check your medical history, ask about your symptoms, carry out a physical examination, and test your reflexes. If they think you have a problem with your nerves, they may refer you to a specialist called a neurologist for further tests to determine the cause. Tests you may have include: blood tests – a blood test can detect substances in the blood (antibodies) resulting from the immune system attacking the nerves nerve studies – a needle may be inserted into your skin to check how well signals are reaching the muscles from the nerves scans – you may have a CT scan or PET scan to check for lung cancer If initial scans do not find cancer, you may be advised to have regular scans every few months for a few years to check that it does not develop later on. Treatments for LEMS There's currently no cure for LEMS, but a number of treatments can help reduce the symptoms. These include: treatment for lung cancer – if you have lung cancer, treating it can significantly improve the symptoms of LEMS medicine to help nerve signals reach the muscles – commonly used medicines include 3,4-diaminopyridine and pyridostigmine medicine to reduce the activity of the immune system (immunosuppressants) – commonly used medicines include steroid tablets (such as prednisolone ), azathioprine and methotrexate plasmapheresis – a procedure to redirect your blood through a machine that filters out the antibodies attacking your nerves immunoglobulin therapy – injections of antibodies from donated blood that temporarily stop your immune system attacking your nerves Medicine is the main treatment, although plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin therapy may be recommended in the short term, or if muscle weakness is severe and other treatments have not helped. Outlook for LEMS Some people respond well to treatment and find that treatment helps keep their symptoms under control. Others respond less well and find the condition affects their everyday activities and quality of life. LEMS does not affect life expectancy if it's not associated with cancer. But people with lung cancer and LEMS tend to have a shorter life expectancy because by this point it's very difficult to treat. Information about you If you have LEMS, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Overview - Laryngeal (larynx) cancer Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Recovery Prevention Laryngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the larynx (voice box). The larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe (trachea). It plays an important role in helping you breathe and speak. In the UK, there are more than 2,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer each year. The condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It's more common in men than women. Symptoms of laryngeal cancer The main symptom of laryngeal cancer is having a hoarse voice for more than 3 weeks. Other symptoms include: a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing a lump or swelling in your neck a long-lasting cough or breathlessness a persistent sore throat or earache a high-pitched wheezing noise when you breathe in severe cases, difficulty breathing Some people may also experience bad breath , unintentional weight loss , or fatigue (extreme tiredness). When to see your GP You should see a GP if you have had a hoarse voice for more than 3 weeks. These symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as laryngitis , but it's a good idea to get them checked out. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer. Read more about diagnosing laryngeal cancer . What causes laryngeal cancer It's not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by: smoking tobacco regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol having family members (such as a parent, brother, sister or child) who have had laryngeal cancer having an unhealthy diet low in fruit and vegetables exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust By adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer. Read more about the causes of laryngeal cancer and preventing laryngeal cancer . How laryngeal cancer is treated The main treatments for laryngeal cancer are radiotherapy , surgery, chemotherapy and targeted cancer medicines. Radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it's diagnosed early. If the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used. If you have surgery to remove your larynx, you'll no longer be able to speak or breathe in the usual way. Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and will need additional treatment and speech and language therapy to help you communicate. This may include a valve being placed in your throat, or using an electrical device you hold against your throat to produce sound. Read more about treating laryngeal cancer and recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery . Outlook The outlook for laryngeal cancer depends on the extent of the cancer when it's diagnosed and treated. Fortunately, most laryngeal cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, which means the outlook is generally better than some other types of cancer. Overall, about 65 out of every 100 people will live for 5 years or more after diagnosis, and about 55 out of every 100 people will live for 10 years or more. If you smoke, stopping smoking after being diagnosed with laryngeal cancer may improve your outlook. Page last reviewed: 21 October 2021 Next review due: 21 October 2024 Next : Causes"

Symptoms of laryngitis Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days. The main symptoms are: a hoarse (croaky) voice sometimes losing your voice an irritating cough that does not go away always needing to clear your throat a sore throat Children can also: have a temperature of 38C or above be off their food or drink have difficulty breathing (but this is rare) Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms. If you're not sure it's laryngitis, check other sore throat symptoms . How you can treat laryngitis yourself Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP. There are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms. Do try to speak as little as possible drink plenty of fluids keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this) Don’t do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice do not smoke do not spend time in smoky or dusty places do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they can cause dehydration How to gargle with salty water Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Warm water helps salt dissolve. Gargle with the solution then spit it out. Do not swallow it. Repeat as often as you like. This is not suitable for younger children.

Symptoms of a lazy eye A lazy eye does not always cause symptoms and is often first diagnosed during an eye test. The main symptoms include: shutting 1 eye or squinting when looking at things eyes pointing in different directions (a squint ) not being able to follow an object or person with your eyes tilting your head when looking at something having tired eyes and rubbing your eyes a lot headaches difficulty catching or throwing tripping or falling over a lot blinking a lot Many children do not notice anything wrong with their vision. You can check a younger child's eyes by covering each eye with your hand, 1 at a time. They may complain if you cover their good eye. Older children may say they're not able to see as well with 1 eye and may have problems with reading, writing and drawing. Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you're worried about your or your child's vision you have not had an eye test for 2 years Find an NHS sight test What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child have a lazy eye, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You'll be asked to look at lights or read letters while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given eye drops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly.

A learning disability is different for everyone. No two people are the same. A person with a learning disability might have some difficulty: understanding complicated information learning some skills looking after themselves or living alone What having a learning disability can mean A learning disability is different for everyone. Lots of people who have a learning disability can work, have relationships, live alone and get qualifications. Other people might need more support throughout their life. Support for people with a learning disability and family carers Doctors and other health workers might be able to tell if a person has a learning disability when they are very young. But some people get a diagnosis later in their lives. This can be when they are adults. If you are diagnosed with a learning disability, you might be referred to other health professionals to get the support you need. What causes a learning disability? We do not always know why a person has a learning disability. Sometimes it is because a person's brain development is affected, either before they are born, during their birth or in early childhood. This can be caused by things such as: the mother becoming ill in pregnancy problems during the birth that stop enough oxygen getting to the brain the unborn baby having some genes passed on from its parents that make having a learning disability more likely illness, such as meningitis , or injury in early childhood There are some health conditions where you may be more likely to have a learning disability. For example, everyone with Down's syndrome has some level of learning disability, and so do many people with cerebral palsy . Some people with epilepsy also have a learning disability and so do many autistic people. Profound and multiple learning disability (PMLD) A profound and multiple learning disability (PMLD) is when a person has a severe learning disability and other disabilities that significantly affect their ability to communicate and be independent. Someone with a profound and multiple learning disability might have difficulties seeing, hearing, speaking and moving. They may have complicated health and social care needs due to these or other conditions. People with a profound and multiple learning disability need support to help them with some areas of their life, such as eating, washing or personal care. Lots of people with a profound and multiple learning disability can still be involved in decisions about themselves, do things they enjoy and be independent. Some people who struggle with talking might be able to use other ways of communication, like sign language, Signalong , Makaton, or digital systems like picture exchange communication systems (PECS).

    "text": "Leg cramps Leg cramps are common, usually harmless, and only last a short time. They can happen at any time, but most people have them at night or when resting. Symptoms of leg cramps Leg cramps happen when a muscle in the leg tightens and causes a sudden pain that can make it hard to move. The cramps can last from a few seconds to 10 minutes. They can affect the: calf muscle, below the knee at the back of the leg muscles in the feet or the thighs (less often) After the cramp has stopped, the muscle might feel sore for up to 24 hours. Things you can do about leg cramps yourself During a cramp Stretching and massaging the muscle may ease the pain during a cramp, although most cramps go away without you doing anything. Standing up and putting your weight on the leg with the cramp may also help. Paracetamol or ibuprofen can help to ease muscle soreness after a cramp, but they will not help when it's happening as they take too long to work. Preventing cramps Regular calf-stretching exercises may help to reduce cramps but may not completely stop them from happening. How to stretch your calf muscles Stand facing a wall and stretch out your arms until your hands can just touch it. Make sure you're able to stand up straight and that your feet are flat on the floor. Lean forward, pressing your hands against the wall until you feel your calf muscles stretch. Hold for 2 or 3 seconds. Stand up straight again. Repeat a few times for 5 minutes, 3 times a day (the last time just before bed). If the number of cramps reduces, you might only need to do the exercise once or twice a day. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: leg cramps are disturbing your sleep you also have numbness or swelling in your legs cramps last longer than 10 minutes Treatment for leg cramps from a GP A GP will examine you to try to find out the reason for your leg cramps. They will suggest a treatment depending on the cause. This might be: stretching exercises quinine tablets if exercise has not helped Quinine is not suitable for everyone. The GP will discuss potential risks and side effects with you. Causes of leg cramps Leg cramps can sometimes be caused by: ageing putting too much strain on muscles during exercise, which can be worse in hot or humid weather pregnancy (usually in the later stage) certain medicines – for example, medicine for lowering cholesterol ( statins ) or high blood pressure (diuretics) not drinking enough fluids ( dehydration ) liver disease because of drinking too much alcohol The reason for some cramps is unknown.

    "text": "Overview - Venous leg ulcer Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention A leg ulcer is a long-lasting (chronic) sore that takes more than 2 weeks to heal. It usually develops on the inside of the leg, between the knee and the ankle. The symptoms of a venous leg ulcer include pain, itching and swelling in the affected leg. There may also be discoloured or hardened skin around the ulcer, and the sore may produce a foul-smelling discharge. See your GP if you think you have a leg ulcer, as it'll need specialist treatment to help it heal. Your GP will examine your leg and may carry out additional tests to rule out other conditions. Find out how a venous leg ulcer is diagnosed What causes venous leg ulcers? A venous leg ulcer is the most common type of leg ulcer, accounting for more than 60% of all cases. Venous leg ulcers can develop after a minor injury, if persistently high pressure in the veins of the legs has weakened the skin. Find out more about the causes of venous leg ulcers Who's affected Venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK, although they become much more common with age. It's estimated around 1 in 50 people over the age of 80 has one. You're more at risk of developing one if you previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or find it difficult to walk because of a problem such as: osteoarthritis a leg injury obesity paralysis You're also more at risk if you recently had an operation on your leg, such as a hip replacement or knee replacement . People with swollen and enlarged veins (varicose veins) also have a higher risk of developing venous leg ulcers. How venous leg ulcers are treated Most venous leg ulcers heal within 6 months if they're treated by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. But some ulcers may take longer to heal, and a very small number never heal. Treatment usually involves: cleaning and dressing the wound using compression, such as bandages or stockings, to improve the flow of blood in the legs Antibiotics may also be used if the ulcer becomes infected, but they do not help ulcers heal. But unless the underlying cause of the ulcer is addressed, there's a high risk of a venous leg ulcer coming back after treatment. Underlying causes could include immobility, obesity, previous DVT or varicose veins. Find out more about how venous leg ulcers are treated Can venous leg ulcers be prevented? There are several ways to help prevent developing a venous leg ulcer in people at risk.

How you get leptospirosis Leptospirosis is spread in the pee of infected animals, most commonly rats, mice, cows, pigs and dogs. You can get leptospirosis if: soil or freshwater (such as water from a river, canal or lake) that contains infected pee gets in your mouth, eyes or a cut, usually during activities like kayaking, outdoor swimming or fishing you touch an infected animal's blood or flesh, usually from working with animals or animal parts It's very rare to get leptospirosis from pets, other people or bites. Symptoms of leptospirosis Most people who get leptospirosis have no symptoms, or mild flu-like symptoms. But some people get seriously ill. Symptoms of leptospirosis may include: high temperature headache body aches and pain tummy ache feeling sick or being sick diarrhoea redness in the white part of your eyes yellowing of the skin (which may be harder to see on black or brown skin) or white part of the eyes ( jaundice ) Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You might have been exposed to infected pee, water, or soil and have: a high temperature, or you feel hot and shivery a headache been feeling sick or being sick diarrhoea body aches and pains red eyes a loss of appetite Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you have: yellow skin (which may be harder to see on black or brown skin) and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) a rash been unable to pee swollen ankles, feet or hands chest pain shortness of breath You can call 111 or get help from NHS 111 online . Treatment from a GP Leptospirosis can often be treated by your GP. You'll usually be given antibiotic tablets to treat the infection. Most people recover in a few days or weeks. It's important to finish the course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve any aches, pains or a high temperature. If you have severe symptoms, you may need to be treated in hospital. How to avoid getting leptospirosis Leptospirosis is rare in the UK. You have a higher chance of getting it if you do outdoor activities like water sports (especially while abroad in tropical areas), or you work with animals or animal parts. There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting leptospirosis. Do wash your hands with soap and water after handling animals or animal products clean any wounds as soon as possible cover any cuts and grazes with waterproof plasters wear protective clothing if you're at risk through your job shower as soon as possible if you've been in potentially infected water check your dog is vaccinated against leptospirosis (there is no vaccine for people) Don’t do not touch water or soil that may contain animal pee do not touch dead animals with your bare hands do not drink water from places like rivers, canals or lakes – always boil or treat it first Page last reviewed: 28 June 2023 Next review due: 28 June 2026"

Acute leukaemia means it progresses quickly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The 2 main types of white blood cells are: monocytes and granulocytes, which come from myeloid stem cells lymphocytes, which come from lymphoid stem cells This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive cancer of the monocyte or granulocyte cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Symptoms of AML The symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become worse over time. Symptoms can include: looking pale or \"washed out\" feeling tired or weak breathlessness frequent infections unusual and frequent bruising or bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds losing weight without trying to Seeking medical advice Speak to a GP if you or your child have possible symptoms of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated. If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange blood tests to check your blood cells. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a specialist in treating blood conditions (haematologist) for further tests and treatment. Find out more about diagnosing AML What causes AML? It's not clear exactly what causes AML and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. But some things can increase your risk of getting AML, including: previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous radiotherapy treatment) smoking and other exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke having a blood disorder or some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome Find out more about the causes of AML Who's affected AML is a rare type of cancer, with around 3,100 people diagnosed with it each year in the UK. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It's most common in people over 75. How AML is treated Treatment for AML needs to begin as soon as possible, as it can develop quickly. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant . Find out more about treating AML Help and support There are organisations that offer information, advice and support if you or a family member has been diagnosed with AML.

They will be able to rule out other possible causes, such as a fungal infection of the mouth ( oral thrush ) or cheek biting. You may be referred to a specialist for a biopsy . This is where a small piece of the patch is removed and checked for abnormal cells. Important: Mouth cancer risk If you have leukoplakia, there's a small chance it could progress to mouth cancer over time. This is why it's important to see a dentist or GP if you have a white patch or patches in your mouth. Treatments for leukoplakia Treatment for leukoplakia is not always needed, but you'll have regular check-ups to make sure the patch is not getting bigger. The patch may get smaller or go away if you: stop smoking stop drinking alcohol or reduce the amount you drink do not chew tobacco, paan or betel nuts Surgery is sometimes used to remove leukoplakia patches if there's a chance that they could become cancerous. This may be done after numbing the affected area using local anaesthetic so you do not feel any pain or discomfort. Sometimes a general anaesthetic is used. The patch can be removed in a number of ways, including using a laser or surgical scalpel. Your mouth should heal quickly afterwards. Preventing leukoplakia and mouth cancer The exact cause of leukoplakia is not known, but smoking and chewing tobacco are thought to increase your chances of getting it. There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting leukoplakia. These may also reduce your risk of getting mouth cancer. Do keep your mouth and teeth healthy by taking care of your teeth and gums have regular dental check-ups if you wear dentures , make sure they fit properly eat a balanced diet , including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables Don’t do not smoke do not chew tobacco, paan or betel nuts do not drink more than the recommended amount of alcohol (14 units a week) Hairy leukoplakia There are a number of different types of leukoplakia. Hairy leukoplakia is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which also causes glandular fever . You may have hairy leukoplakia if you have a weakened immune system – for example, if you have HIV or have had an organ transplant. It causes fuzzy white patches, often on the sides of the tongue, that look folded or ridged. They're not painful and cannot be brushed or scraped away. Antiviral medicines, or treatments you put onto the patch, are sometimes used to treat hairy leukoplakia. Unlike other types, hairy leukoplakia does not carry a risk of mouth cancer.

Symptoms of lichen sclerosus Lichen sclerosus affects people of all ages, including children. But it's much more common in women over 50. People with white, brown or black skin can get lichen sclerosus. It causes patches on the skin that are usually: itchy white smooth or crinkled easily damaged – they may bleed or hurt if rubbed or scratched The patches can appear anywhere, but most often are on the: area around the opening to the vagina (vulva) and anus foreskin and end of the penis Having sex can be painful because the vulva may shrink or tighten. In men, the foreskin may tighten making erections painful. See what lichen sclerosus looks like on the vulva, foreskin and anus Lichen sclerosus patch on the vulva. Credit: DR P.

Treatment for lichen sclerosus Lichen sclerosus cannot be cured, but using a strong prescription steroid ointment usually helps relieve the symptoms. You may need to use the ointment regularly for a few months to get your symptoms under control. Your doctor will tell you how often you need to use the ointment. After the initial treatment period, you may need to use other products, such as a weaker steroid ointment or a moisturising cream, to help manage your symptoms. Follow your doctor's advice about how and when to use any medicine that's prescribed for you. Problems caused by lichen sclerosus Although treatment for lichen sclerosus can help, the affected skin can sometimes become scarred and tight over time. The vulva may shrink, with the clitoris and small inner lips (labia minora) around the opening of the vagina often affected. The scarring and tightness can cause discomfort when peeing, pooing and during sex. Having an erection can be painful. If lichen sclerosus is severe, you might need a small operation, such as surgery to widen your vagina or remove your foreskin ( circumcision ). Cancer and lichen sclerosus Lichen sclerosus increases your risk of getting cancer on your vulva, penis or anus. The risk is low, but it's a good idea to check yourself regularly and see a GP if you're worried. Symptoms to look for include a lump, a change in skin texture, such as thickening, or an ulcer that does not go away. Find out about vulval cancer , penile cancer and anal cancer. Causes of lichen sclerosus The cause of lichen sclerosus is unknown. It might be caused by your immune system, the body's defence against infection, mistakenly attacking and damaging your skin. Lichen sclerosus is: not caused by an infection not contagious – you cannot spread it to other people through close contact, including sex not caused by poor personal hygiene Rubbing or damage to the skin can trigger lichen sclerosus or make it worse.

Symptoms of lipoedema Lipoedema is more common in women. It usually affects both sides of the body equally. Lipoedema can make your bottom, thighs, lower legs and sometimes your arms look out of proportion with the rest of the body. In early-stage lipoedema, you may have bigger legs, a narrow waist and a much smaller upper body. Credit: Lipoedema UK You may have a large bottom, thighs, and lower legs, but your feet are not usually affected. Credit: Lipoedema Sometimes lipoedema can affect the arms too, but the hands are not usually affected. Credit: Lipoedema UK. The affected skin feels soft and cool and may be dimpled with an \"orange peel\" texture. Credit: Lipoedema UK You may also have pain, tenderness or heaviness in the affected limbs, and you may bruise easily. Lipoedema affects people differently. Some people have mild symptoms that do not affect their life. Others can struggle with physical problems, blaming themselves for the changes in their body, and have mental health problems. Other causes of large or swollen legs There are other things that can cause large or swollen legs. If you have swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, it could be lymphoedema . This can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs and develops when the lymphatic system does not work properly. Sometimes, a build-up of fluid can cause the legs, ankles or feet to become swollen. This is called oedema . In lipoedema, the feet are not usually affected. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of lipoedema you have swollen legs, ankles or feet and the swelling has not improved after a few days Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your leg or legs become swollen, red, hot and painful and you have flu-like symptoms You may have cellulitis (a skin infection) and need treatment with antibiotics. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatments for lipoedema If the GP thinks you have lipoedema they may refer you to a specialist for treatment. There's currently no cure, but there are things that can help and stop it getting worse. Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and how they're affecting you. The main treatments are: eating healthily , doing more exercise and trying to maintain a healthy weight wearing compression stockings or bandages to reduce pain and discomfort, and make it easier for you to walk looking after your skin – for example, by regularly using moisturising cream ( emollients ) to stop your skin drying out counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) if you're finding it difficult to cope with your symptoms and you feel depressed a procedure to get rid of the fat ( liposuction ) if your symptoms are particularly severe – you may need more than 1 operation and it may not be available on the NHS Compression therapy Compression therapy can sometimes help manage lipoedema. A specially trained clinician will assess you and recommend the most suitable type of compression. Find out more about compression therapy for lipoedema on the LymphConnect website Getting support Talking to someone and getting support can help if lipoedema is affecting your quality of life. Lipoedema UK and Talk Lipoedema give help and advice about managing lipoedema. They can also put you in touch with other people with it. Causes of lipoedema The exact cause of lipoedema is not clear. It's not caused by being overweight – you can be a healthy weight and still get it. It may be caused by changes in your hormones: during puberty when you're pregnant when you're going through the menopause when you're taking the contraceptive pill Sometimes lipoedema runs in families.

Listeria can contaminate a wide range of foods, but most infections are caused by eating chilled, ready-to-eat foods, such as: cold, cooked sliced meats and cured meats smoked and cured fish – including in sushi cooked shellfish soft mould-ripened cheeses (such as camembert and brie) and blue-veined cheeses pâté pre-prepared sandwiches and salads pre-cut fruit (such as pre-packed melon slices) unpasteurised milk dairy products made from unpasteurised milk Information: These foods do not always contain listeria. If you have eaten them recently, you do not need to do anything unless you get symptoms of the infection. Although it's less common, you can also catch listeriosis from: someone else who has it – for example, if you eat food they've handled when they've not washed their hands close contact with farm animals – especially sheep and cows that are giving birth Symptoms of listeriosis In most people, listeriosis has no symptoms or only causes mild symptoms for a few days, such as: a high temperature aches and pains chills feeling or being sick diarrhoea If you're pregnant, you may also have a stomach ache or notice your baby moving less than usual. Babies with listeriosis may also be irritable and feed less than usual. Risks of listeriosis Listeriosis is not usually serious for most people. But some people have a higher risk of serious problems, including: anyone who is pregnant newborn babies people with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as cancer, diabetes, liver disease or kidney disease people having treatment that weakens their immune system, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets Older people are also at higher risk of getting seriously ill from listeriosis, and this risk increases with age. If you get listeriosis while you're pregnant, there is a risk it could cause miscarriage or stillbirth . In babies and people with a weakened immune system, listeriosis can sometimes lead to serious and life-threatening problems such as sepsis or meningitis . Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you're pregnant and think you have listeriosis you have a condition that weakens your immune system (like cancer or kidney disease) and think you have listeriosis you're having treatment that weakens your immune system (like chemotherapy or steroid tablets) and think you have listeriosis you think your baby might have listeriosis You can call NHS 111 or get help from 111 online . If you're pregnant, you can also call your midwife for advice. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if you or your child: have a severe headache and stiff neck find it uncomfortable to look at bright lights have a fit (seizure) feel suddenly confused feel very sleepy or are difficult to wake have a rash that does not fade when a glass is rolled over it – the rash may be blotchy, like bruises or small red pinpricks These could be symptoms of meningitis caused by listeriosis, which needs to be treated in hospital straight away. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatment for listeriosis For most people, listeriosis is mild and gets better in a few days. You can usually look after yourself at home by resting and drinking plenty of fluids. If you're at a higher risk of getting seriously ill (for example, you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system), you may need antibiotics. Find out how to treat diarrhoea and vomiting How to avoid listeriosis There are some simple things you can do to reduce your risk of getting listeriosis. Do keep chilled, ready-to-eat foods cold – try to make sure your fridge is working properly and is set to 5C or below eat ready-to-eat foods within 4 hours of taking them out of the fridge eat, cook or freeze foods by their use-by date follow storage instructions on food labels and use opened food within 2 days (unless the packaging says otherwise) keep raw and ready-to-eat foods separate follow any cooking instructions on packaging, and cook or reheat (including frozen vegetables) until they're steaming hot right through wash your hands regularly with soap and water Foods to avoid if you're at risk If you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system, you should avoid eating ready-to-eat cold-smoked or cured fish products, such as smoked salmon or gravlax (unless cooked until steaming hot). If you're pregnant, you should also avoid eating other foods that have the highest risk of causing listeriosis. These include: some soft cheeses (including brie and camembert) – unless cooked until steaming hot all types of pâté – including vegetable pâté unpasteurised milk or dairy products any undercooked food If you're pregnant, you should also avoid close contact with farm animals that are giving birth or have recently given birth.

You can help prevent some of them by maintaining a healthy weight and staying within the recommended alcohol limits, if you drink. Types of liver disease There are several types of liver disease, which can have different causes. Common types of liver disease and the possible causes Condition Possible causes Alcohol-related liver disease Regularly drinking too much alcohol Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Being very overweight (obese) – this may cause fat to build up in the liver Hepatitis Catching a viral infection or regularly drinking too much alcohol Haemochromatosis A gene that runs in families and may be passed from parents to children Primary biliary cholangitis May be caused by a problem with the immune system Symptoms of liver disease Most types of liver disease do not cause any symptoms in the early stages. Once you start to get symptoms of liver disease, your liver is already damaged and scarred. This is known as cirrhosis . Symptoms of cirrhosis include: feeling very tired and weak all the time loss of appetite – which may lead to weight loss loss of sex drive (libido) yellow skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) itchy skin feeling or being sick Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have liver disease or cirrhosis Information: If you or your child has been diagnosed with liver disease, the British Liver Trust or Children's Liver Disease Foundation can also offer advice and support. Treatment for liver disease Treatment for liver disease depends on the type you have and how severe it is. Healthy lifestyle changes can help with some types of liver disease. For example, alcohol-related liver disease may improve if you stop drinking alcohol. Some types of liver disease (such as certain types of hepatitis) may need to be treated with medicine. If you have severe liver damage and scarring (cirrhosis), you may need a liver transplant. How to prevent liver disease The 3 main causes of liver disease are: obesity an undiagnosed hepatitis infection alcohol misuse You can reduce your risk of many types of liver disease with some simple lifestyle changes such as: trying to maintain a healthy weight not drinking too much alcohol Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and hepatitis B . These are recommended if you're at risk. Important You do not have to drink an excessive amount of alcohol to risk damaging your health.

    "text": "Overview - Alcohol-related liver disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. Symptoms of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) ARLD does not usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin ( jaundice ) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Alcohol and the liver The liver is one of the most complex organs in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is common in the UK. The number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD Stages of ARLD There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained here. Alcoholic fatty liver disease Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for some time (months or years), your liver should return to normal. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis, which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis , is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. Treating alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. But support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services . A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Complications Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol misuse is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure . Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer increased vulnerability to infection Read more about the complications of ARLD Preventing alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week if you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you have been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short-term and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health. See our alcohol advice pages for more information and support. Video: Liver disease In this video, consultant hepatologist Mark Wright explains liver disease and how not drinking alcohol can help.

    "text": "Long QT syndrome Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a rare heart condition that's usually inherited. It can cause serious problems with your heart rhythm, but there are things you can do to reduce the risk. Symptoms of long QT syndrome Long QT syndrome can cause heart palpitations , where you suddenly feel your heart beating irregularly or faster than usual. Your heart rhythm usually goes back to normal on its own, but if it continues you may have: fainting a seizure or fit a cardiac arrest (where your heart beats so fast that not enough blood gets to your brain, so you become unconscious and stop breathing) Symptoms can be triggered by exercise, a shock or sudden noise, excitement or stress. They can also happen while you're resting or sleeping. Many people with long QT syndrome do not have any symptoms. Sometimes it's found when you have a heart rhythm test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: someone's not breathing normally and not moving or responding – they could be having a cardiac arrest someone's having a seizure or fit someone's fainted and cannot be woken up within 1 minute Follow the instructions from the 999 operator until an ambulance arrives. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You've been diagnosed with long QT syndrome, or you're worried you have it, and: you've fainted and have now recovered you have heart palpitations that keep coming back, last longer than a few minutes or are getting worse you've had a seizure or fit and have now recovered Also ask for an urgent GP appointment if your parent, child, brother or sister has been diagnosed with long QT syndrome, or died unexpectedly. You may need tests to check your heart. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Tests for long QT syndrome If a GP thinks you could have long QT syndrome, they'll refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) for tests and treatment. Long QT syndrome is diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG) , where sensors are put on your chest to check your heart. You may also need to: wear a heart monitor for 24 hours have an ECG while exercising If you have long QT syndrome, the ECG results will show a pattern in the way your heart beats called a \"prolonged QT interval\". As long QT syndrome is usually inherited, you may also be offered genetic testing to see if you have genes linked to the condition. Important If you're diagnosed with long QT syndrome, your immediate family should also be offered testing, as there's a chance they could also have the condition. Treatments for long QT syndrome Treatment for long QT syndrome depends on the cause, your test results, your symptoms and if you're at high risk of serious problems. You may be offered: medicines called beta blockers to help control your heart rhythm – recommended for most people with long QT syndrome a small device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) that's put under the skin in your chest, in a similar way to a pacemaker – recommended if you're at high risk of serious heart problems surgery to cut certain nerves that affect the heart – only recommended in rare cases if other treatments are not suitable You'll also be given advice about lifestyle changes to make, and you'll be monitored regularly to check the health of your heart. Sometimes long QT syndrome is caused by another health condition or medicine. In these cases, treating the condition or stopping the medicine can improve the symptoms. How to reduce the risk of heart rhythm problems if you have long QT syndrome If you have long QT syndrome, it's important to avoid triggers that can cause problems with your heart rhythm. Your care team will give you advice about which lifestyle changes are right for you. Do check with a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medicines or supplements – some medicines and supplements can cause problems in people with long QT syndrome eat foods containing potassium, such as bananas, some vegetables and pulses – your doctor may also recommend potassium supplements try to avoid sudden noises, such as alarm clocks try to manage stress and anxiety Don’t do not do strenuous exercise or sports, including swimming do not get dehydrated – you may need rehydration solutions if you're being sick or have diarrhoea do not have energy drinks that contain a lot of caffeine Causes of long QT syndrome Long QT syndrome is usually caused by the genes you inherit from your parents. It can also be caused by: certain medicines, including some types of antibiotics, antihistamines, antidepressants and heart medicines some other heart problems a bleed in your brain (haemorrhage) or stroke conditions that cause very low levels of potassium, magnesium or calcium Help and support for long QT syndrome If you or someone in your family lives with long QT syndrome, you can get support from charities: British Heart Foundation: support Cardiac Risk in the Young Page last reviewed: 06 January 2025 Next review due: 06 January 2028"

Laser and lens surgery Some people with long-sightedness may be able to have laser eye surgery or lens replacement surgery to correct their vision. Both types of surgery are carried out while you are awake, using local anaesthetic, so you will not feel any pain. Laser eye surgery is where high-energy beams of light (lasers) are used to reshape the surface of the eye (the cornea) to correct the way your eye focuses. Lens surgery is where the lens inside your eye is replaced with a plastic implant to correct your vision. Ask your optician if laser or lens surgery may be options for you. These treatments are not usually available on the NHS. Find out more about laser eye surgery and lens surgery Causes of long-sightedness Long-sightedness happens when the eyes cannot focus properly. This can be because of: the shape of your eye the shape of the front layer of your eye (the cornea) the lens inside your eye has become stiffer, usually due to aging (presbyopia) Long-sightedness is often passed on from your parents and cannot be prevented. It can also be caused by other conditions like diabetes and eye cancer, but this is very rare. Complications of long-sightedness If left untreated, long-sightedness may cause other vision problems. Young children with severe long-sightedness are more likely to develop other eye problems, including lazy eye and squint . Page last reviewed: 07 February 2023 Next review due: 07 February 2026"

    "text": "Non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours A brain tumour is where cells in the brain grow in an uncontrolled way. Non-cancerous tumours (also called low-grade or benign tumours) usually grow slowly and are less likely to spread than cancerous tumours. Information: There is separate information about cancerous (malignant) brain tumours . Symptoms of a brain tumour The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on which part of the brain is affected. As non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly, the symptoms usually come on gradually and may get worse slowly over months or years. Symptoms of a brain tumour can include: headaches that get worse over time or do not go away – although it's unusual for a headache to be the only symptom seizures (fits) feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) feeling sleepy or dizzy changes in your eyesight, such as blurred or double vision changes in behaviour or personality, such as confusion or problems with memory and concentration problems with speech, movement and balance Brain tumours can affect people of any age. They're more common in older adults, but some types can affect young adults or children. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you keep getting headaches, they do not go away or they're getting worse you have headaches that wake you up at night or are worse in the morning you have any other symptoms of a brain tumour that do not go away Get help from 111 online or call 111. Call 111 for a child under 5 years old. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you have a headache that came on suddenly and is extremely painful someone has a seizure (fit) for the first time Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. What happens at your GP appointment If you have symptoms of a brain tumour or another problem affecting the brain, a GP may do some simple tests to check things like your eyesight, balance and memory. If there are signs of a possible problem, they may refer you for a brain scan or to a brain specialist (neurologist) for more tests. Being referred for tests does not mean anything is seriously wrong. Tests to check for a brain tumour The main test to check for a tumour is a brain scan (usually an MRI scan ). This can show if you have a possible tumour, but you'll usually need more tests to confirm it. Most people have a procedure to remove a small sample of cells for testing. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy can show what type of tumour you have and how fast it's likely to grow (called the \"grade\"). Brain tumours are given a grade from 1 to 4. Grades 1 and 2 are generally considered to be non-cancerous (low-grade or benign) because they grow more slowly. Important: Driving You must tell the DVLA if you have a brain tumour. You may not be allowed to drive until after the tumour has been treated. This depends on the type of tumour you have, where it is in the brain and what symptoms you have. Find out how to tell the DVLA you have a brain tumour on GOV.UK Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: getting diagnosed with a brain tumour Cancer Research UK: brain tumours and driving Types of non-cancerous brain tumour There are many different types of non-cancerous brain tumour. Each type affects a different part of the brain. Some types of brain tumour can be either non-cancerous or cancerous. Some types are only non-cancerous. Common types of non-cancerous brain tumour Type Area affected Meningioma The thin layer of tissue covering the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Glioma The cells that support and protect the nerve cells in the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Acoustic neuroma The nerve connecting the brain to the inner ear Pituitary adenoma A pea-sized gland in the brain that produces hormones (pituitary gland) Information: Find out more The Brain Tumour Charity: adult brain tumour types The Brain Tumour Charity: child brain tumour types Treatment for non-cancerous brain tumours Non-cancerous brain tumours are usually treatable. Your treatment depends on the type of tumour it is, where it is in your brain and any symptoms you have. You may not need treatment straight away because non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly. You might just have regular check-ups and scans to monitor it. If treatment is needed, the main treatment is surgery to remove the tumour. This usually involves cutting out a small piece of skull so the surgeon can remove the tumour. The piece is then fixed back in place and the cut in your skin is closed with stitches. Some people may need other treatments, such as: radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill the tumour cells) chemotherapy (where medicines are used to kill the tumour cells) treatment for any symptoms caused by the tumour (for example, medicines for nausea, seizures or pain) Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: treatment for brain tumours The Brain Tumour Charity: neurosurgery for brain tumours Recovering from a non-cancerous brain tumour Most non-cancerous brain tumours can be successfully treated, but it can take a while to recover from the effects of a tumour and any treatment you had. Side effects of a brain tumour, or treatment for a brain tumour, may include: extreme tiredness (fatigue) problems with your concentration or memory problems with your speech, vision or movement changes to your mood or personality For some people, side effects may start months or years after treatment finishes. You may need treatment and support to help you recover, such as: exercises and help with movement from a physiotherapist help with speech and communication problems from a speech and language therapist changes to your home and advice about making everyday tasks easier from an occupational therapist help with your mental health from a counsellor or psychologist There's also a small chance a tumour could come back or could become cancerous, so you'll have regular check-ups and scans for at least a few years after treatment. Information: Find out more The Brain Tumour Charity: living with a brain tumour Causes of non-cancerous brain tumours It's not known what causes most non-cancerous brain tumours. But there are some things that can increase your risk, including: your age – brain tumours are most common in older adults (but they can affect young adults and children too) having close relatives who've had brain tumours having had radiotherapy to your head before (for example, if you had a head or neck cancer as a child) having a rare genetic condition that causes tumours, such as neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: risks and causes of brain tumours Help and support if you have a brain tumour If you have a brain tumour, your care team will support you throughout your treatment.

    "title": "Overview-Lung cancer",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lung-cancer/",
    "text": "Overview - Lung cancer Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Prevention Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer. More than 43,000 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK. There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including: a persistent cough coughing up blood persistent breathlessness unexplained tiredness and weight loss an ache or pain when breathing or coughing You should see a GP if you have these symptoms. Types of lung cancer Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads to the lungs from another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This page is about primary lung cancer. There are two main forms of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts growing. They are: non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common form, accounting for around 80 to 85 out of 100 cases. It can be one of three types: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma. small-cell lung cancer – a less common form that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer. The type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended. Who's affected Lung cancer mainly affects older people. It's rare in people younger than 40. More than 4 out of 10 people diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK are aged 75 and older. Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the most common cause (accounting for more than 70 out of 100 cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances. Treating lung cancer Treatment depends on the type of mutation the cancer has, how far it's spread and how good your general health is. If the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung may be recommended. If surgery is unsuitable due to your general health, radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead. If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually used. There are also a number of medicines known as targeted therapies. They target a specific change in or around the cancer cells that is helping them to grow. Targeted therapies cannot cure lung cancer but they can slow its spread. Outlook Lung cancer does not usually cause noticeable symptoms until it's spread through the lungs or into other parts of the body. This means the outlook for the condition is not as good as many other types of cancer. About 2 in 5 people with the condition live for at least 1 year after they're diagnosed, and about 1 in 10 people live at least 10 years. However, survival rates vary widely, depending on how far the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis can make a big difference.

Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you often get symptoms of lupus Lupus is better managed if it's found and treated early. Tests for lupus Lupus is not always easy to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to other conditions. A GP will usually do some blood tests. They may diagnose lupus if the tests show you have high levels of a certain type of antibody, and you also have the typical symptoms of lupus. You might be referred for X-rays and scans of your heart, kidneys and other organs if the doctor thinks they might be affected. If lupus is confirmed, you'll be advised to have regular checks and tests, such as blood tests to check for anaemia and urine tests to check for kidney problems.

    "text": "Lyme disease Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be spread to humans by infected ticks. It's usually easier to treat if it's diagnosed early. Symptoms of Lyme disease A circular or oval shape rash around a tick bite can be an early symptom of Lyme disease in some people. The rash can appear up to 3 months after being bitten by an infected tick, but usually appears within 1 to 4 weeks. It can last for several weeks. The rash can have a darker or lighter area in the centre and might gradually spread. It's not usually hot or itchy. The rash may be flat, or slightly raised, and look pink, red, or purple when it appears on white skin. It can be harder to see the rash on brown and black skin and it may look like a bruise. The rash may look like a bullseye on a dartboard. Credit: CDC/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/95650/view Sometimes the edges of the rash may feel slightly raised. Credit: LARRY MULVEHILL/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/259371/view The rash can be less obvious on black or brown skin, and may look more like a bruise. Credit: Lyme Disease Research Center at Johns Hopkins University: https://www.hopkinslyme.org/ Some people also get flu-like symptoms a few days or weeks after they were bitten by an infected tick, such as: a high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery headache muscle and joint pain tiredness and loss of energy Other symptoms of Lyme disease Some people with Lyme disease develop more severe symptoms months or years later. This is more likely if treatment is delayed. These more severe symptoms may include: pain and swelling in joints nerve problems – such as pain or numbness heart problems trouble with memory or concentration The chance of getting Lyme disease Not all ticks in England carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. But it's still important to be aware of ticks and to safely remove them as soon as possible, just in case. Ticks that may cause Lyme disease are found all over the UK, but high-risk places include grassy and wooded areas in southern England and the Scottish Highlands. What are ticks? Credit: SINCLAIR STAMMERS/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/263611/view Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures that live in woods, areas with long grass, and sometimes in urban parks and gardens. They're found all over the UK. Ticks do not jump or fly. They attach to the skin of animals or humans that brush past them. Once a tick bites into the skin, it feeds on blood for a few days before dropping off. How to avoid Lyme disease You can reduce your risk of getting Lyme disease by avoiding tick bites and removing the tick quickly if you do get bitten. How to spot and remove ticks To remove a tick safely: Use fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool. You can buy these from some pharmacies, vets and pet shops. Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. Slowly pull upwards, taking care not to squeeze or crush the tick. Dispose of it when you have removed it. Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water. The chance of getting ill is low. You do not need to do anything else unless you notice a rash or become unwell. You can remove a tick safely using fine-tipped tweezers.

You may not notice a tick unless you see it on your skin. Regularly check for ticks on your clothes and skin, and on children and pets after being outdoors. How to avoid tick bites To reduce the chance of being bitten by a tick: cover your skin while walking outdoors and tuck your trousers into your socks use insect repellent on your clothes and skin – products containing DEET are best stay on clear paths whenever possible wear light-coloured clothing so ticks are easier to see and brush off Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you've been bitten by a tick or visited an area in the past 3 months where infected ticks could be and you either: feel unwell with flu-like symptoms – such as feeling hot and shivery, headaches or aching muscles have a round or oval shape rash Tell them if you have recently been in forests or grassy areas. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at your appointment If you think you could have Lyme disease the GP will ask about your symptoms and consider any rash or recent tick bites you know about. Lyme disease can be difficult to diagnose. It has similar symptoms to other conditions and there's not always an obvious rash. 2 types of blood test are available to help confirm or rule out Lyme disease. But these tests are not always accurate in the early stages of the disease. You may need to be retested if you still have Lyme disease symptoms after a negative result. Treatment for Lyme disease from a GP If a GP thinks you might have Lyme disease, they'll prescribe a course of antibiotics. Treatment is more effective if it's started as soon as possible. The antibiotics you're given will depend on your symptoms, but you may need to take them for up to 28 days. It's important to finish the course, even if you start to feel better. If you have severe symptoms you may be referred to a specialist in hospital so antibiotics can be given directly into a vein. Most people with Lyme disease get better after antibiotic treatment. This can take months for some people, but the symptoms should improve over time. If you have symptoms of Lyme disease that last a long time after treatment you may be referred to a specialist in hospital for advice and more blood tests. Important Some websites offer tests and treatment for Lyme disease that may not be supported by scientific evidence. Speak to a doctor for advice before buying tests or treatment online. Ongoing symptoms of Lyme disease A few people who are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease continue to have symptoms, like tiredness, aches and loss of energy, that can last for years. These symptoms are often compared to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome . It's not clear why this happens to some people and not others. This means there's also no agreed treatment. Speak to a doctor if your symptoms come back, or do not improve, after treatment with antibiotics. The doctor may be able to offer you further support if needed, such as: referral for a care needs assessment telling your employer, school or higher education institution that you need a gradual return to activities communicating with children and families' social care Page last reviewed: 03 June 2025 Next review due: 03 June 2028 Some images provided by the Lyme Disease Research Center at Johns Hopkins University ."

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lymphoedema/",
    "text": "Overview - Lymphoedema Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Lymphoedema is a long-term (chronic) condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs. It develops when the lymphatic system does not work properly. The lymphatic system is a network of channels and glands throughout the body that helps fight infection and remove excess fluid. It's important that lymphoedema is identified and treated as soon as possible. If it is not treated, it can get worse. Symptoms of lymphoedema The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body. It can be difficult to fit into clothes, and jewellery and watches can feel tight. At first, the swelling may be soft and easy to push in, leaving a dent, and may come and go. It may get worse during the day and go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent. Other symptoms in an affected body part can include: an aching, heavy feeling difficulty with movement repeated skin infections developing hard, tight or thickened skin folds developing in the skin wart-like growths developing on the skin fluid leaking through the skin Signs of lymphoedema in the head and neck may include swelling or heaviness in the face, mouth or throat, and problems with swallowing and speech. What causes lymphoedema? Lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The main functions of the lymphatic system are helping fight infection and draining excess fluid from tissues. There are 2 main types of lymphoedema: primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes that affect the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually starts during infancy, adolescence, or early adulthood secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system; it can be the result of a cancer treatment, an infection, injury, inflammation of the limb, or a lack of limb movement Read more about the causes of lymphoedema Who's affected Lymphoedema is thought to affect more than 200,000 people in the UK. Primary lymphoedema is rare and secondary lymphoedema is much more common. Secondary lymphoedema often affects people with cancers that involve the lymph system or who've had treatment to the lymph nodes, such as breast cancer , vulval cancer , penile cancer , and head and neck cancer . People who have treatment for skin cancer (melanoma) in the lymph nodes in the groin can also get lymphoedema. Your treatment team will let you know if you're at risk of getting lymphoedema from your cancer or cancer treatment. Any planned treatment you have will try to avoid causing damage to your lymph nodes. Cancer Research UK has more information about lymphoedema and cancer . Diagnosing lymphoedema See a GP if you experience the typical symptoms of lymphoedema, such as swelling in your arms and legs. They may refer you to a specialist lymphoedema treatment centre for further assessment. In many cases, lymphoedema can be diagnosed from your symptoms and medical history, and by examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it's enlarged. Occasionally, further tests may be necessary to assess and monitor your condition. If you're being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you'll be monitored for it afterwards. Read more about diagnosing lymphoedema Treating lymphoedema There's no cure for lymphoedema, but it's usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system. These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques. Read more about treating lymphoedema and preventing lymphoedema . Complications Cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema. It can also have a significant psychological impact. It can be serious if it's not treated quickly. Cellulitis If you have lymphoedema, the build-up of fluid in your tissues makes you more vulnerable to infection. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) that often affects people with lymphoedema. Cellulitis can also sometimes cause lymphoedema. Symptoms of cellulitis can include: redness and a feeling of heat in the skin – this may be harder to see on brown and black skin pain and increased swelling in the affected area a high temperature chills Antibiotics taken by mouth (orally) can usually be used to treat cellulitis, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously). Psychological impact Living with a long-term condition that affects your appearance can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression . You may be depressed if you've been feeling down for the past few months and no longer find pleasure in things you usually enjoy. If this is the case, talk to a GP or a member of your lymphoedema treatment team. Effective treatments are available for depression. Talking to other people with lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety. Visit the Lymphoedema Support Network website for information and advice . They can also put you in touch with a support group in your area. If you continue with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable.

    "text": "What is AMD? - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Contents What is AMD? Symptoms Getting diagnosed Treatments Living with AMD Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that affects the middle part of your vision. It usually first affects people in their 50s. It does not cause total blindness, but it can make things like reading and recognising faces difficult. Without treatment, your vision may get worse. This can happen gradually over several years, before it can then get worse quickly over a few weeks or months. The exact cause is unknown. It's been linked to things such as ageing, smoking, high blood pressure, being overweight and having a family history of AMD.

    "title": "Macular hole",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/macular-hole/",
    "text": "Macular hole A macular hole is a small gap that opens at the centre of the retina, in an area called the macula. The retina is the light-sensitive film at the back of the eye. In the centre is the macula – the part responsible for central and fine-detail vision needed for tasks such as reading. In the early stages, a macular hole can cause blurred and distorted vision. Straight lines may look wavy or bowed, and you may have trouble reading small print. After a while, you may see a small black patch or a \"missing patch\" in the centre of your vision. You won't feel any pain and the condition doesn't lead to a total loss of sight. Surgery is usually needed to repair the hole. This is often successful, but you need to be aware of the possible complications of treatment. Your vision will never completely return to normal, but it's usually improved by having surgery. Why does it happen? We don't know why macular holes develop. The vast majority of cases have no obvious cause. They most often affect people aged 60 to 80 and are more common in women than men. One possible risk factor is a condition called vitreomacular traction. As you get older, the vitreous jelly in the middle of your eye starts to pull away from the retina and macula at the back of the eye. If some of the vitreous jelly remains attached to the retina as it shrinks, it can pull a section of the retina away with it, leading to a macular hole. A few cases may be associated with: retinal detachment – when the retina begins to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients severe injury to the eye being slightly long-sighted (hyperopic) being very short-sighted (myopic) persistent swelling of the central retina (cystoid macular oedema) What should I do? If you have blurred or distorted vision, or there's a black spot in the centre of your vision, see an optician or a GP as soon as possible. You'll probably be referred to a specialist in eye conditions (ophthalmologist). If you do have a macular hole and you don't seek help, your central vision will probably get gradually worse. Relatively early treatment (within months) may give a better outcome in terms of improvement in vision. Sometimes the hole may close and heal by itself, so your ophthalmologist may want to monitor it before recommending treatment. Vitrectomy surgery to repair a macular hole A macular hole can often be repaired by an operation called a vitrectomy. It has been shown to be the case that the earlier this surgery is performed after symptoms begin, the greater the possibility of successfully closing the hole. Even if surgery does not close the hole, your vision will usually at least become stable, and you may find you have less vision distortion. In a minority of patients, the hole does not close despite surgery, and the central vision can continue to deteriorate. However, a second operation can still be successful in closing the hole. What does vitrectomy surgery involve? Macular hole surgery is a form of keyhole surgery performed under a microscope. Small incisions are made in the white of the eye and very fine instruments are inserted. First, the vitreous jelly is removed (vitrectomy) and then a very delicate layer (the inner limiting membrane) is carefully peeled off the surface of the retina around the hole to release the forces that keep the hole open. The eye is then filled with a temporary gas bubble, which presses the hole flat onto the back of the eye to help it seal. The bubble of gas will block the vision while it's present, but it slowly disappears. Macular hole surgery usually lasts about an hour and can be done while you're awake (under local anaesthetic) or asleep (under general anaesthetic) . Most patients opt for a local anaesthetic, which involves a numbing injection around the eye, so no pain is felt during the operation. What can I expect after the operation? Temporary poor vision With the gas in place, the vision in your eye will be very poor – a bit like having your eye open under water. Your balance may be affected and you'll have trouble judging distances, so be aware of steps and kerbs. You may have problems with activities such as pouring liquids or picking up objects. In the first few weeks after the operation, the gas bubble slowly starts to shrink. As this happens, the space that was taken up by the gas fills with the natural fluid made by your eye, and your vision should start to improve. It generally takes a few months for the gas to be absorbed and vision to improve. Mild pain or discomfort Your eye may be mildly sore after the operation and will probably feel sensitive. Contact your ophthalmologist immediately or go to your nearest eye A&E department if at any time: you're in severe pain your vision gets worse than it was on the day after the surgery you have a shadow across your vision Protective dressing When you wake up, your eye will be padded with a protective plastic shield taped over it. The pad and shield can be removed the day after the operation. Going home You may be able to go home the same day, but some patients need to stay in hospital overnight. If you've had a general anaesthetic, you will not be able to leave the hospital unless a responsible adult is there to help you get home. Medication You'll usually be prescribed eye drops to use after surgery. These can help prevent infection and reduce inflammation. You'll be seen again in the clinic about 2 weeks after the operation and, if all is well, the drops will be reduced over the following weeks. Caring for your eye at home For the first few weeks after you return home, you may need to avoid: rubbing your eye – you may be asked to wear an eyepatch swimming – to avoid infection from the water strenuous exercise wearing eye make-up Do I need to position myself face down after the operation? Once at home, you may have to spend several hours during the day with your head held still and in a specific position, called posturing. The aim of lying or sitting face down is to keep the gas bubble in contact with the hole as much as possible, to encourage it to close. There's evidence that lying face down improves the success rate for larger holes, but it may not be needed for smaller holes. If you're asked to do some face-down posturing, your head should be positioned so the tip of your nose points straight down to the ground. This could be done sitting at a table, or lying flat on your stomach on a bed or sofa. Your doctor will advise you on whether you need to do this and, if so, for how long. If face-down posturing isn't advised, you may simply be told to avoid lying on your back for at least 2 weeks after the surgery. Sleeping You may be advised to avoid sleeping on your back following surgery, to make sure the gas bubble is in contact with the macular hole as much as possible. Your ophthalmologist will advise you whether you need to sleep like this and for how long. Am I able to travel after macular hole surgery? You must not fly or travel to high altitude on land while the gas bubble is still in your eye (up to 12 weeks after surgery). If you ignore this, the bubble may expand at altitude, causing very high pressure inside your eye. This can result in severe pain and permanent loss of vision. What if I need another operation shortly after my treatment? If you need a general anaesthetic while the gas is still in your eye, it's vital you tell the anaesthetist so they can avoid certain anaesthetic agents that can cause expansion of the bubble. The same advice applies if you are offered gas and air (Entonox), a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas, for pain relief. Can I drive after the operation? You're advised not to drive after your operation while the gas bubble is still present in your eye. You'll notice the bubble shrinking and will be aware when it has completely gone. This can take several weeks, so ask your specialist if you’re unsure when you can start driving again. It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive. GOV.UK has more information about the law on eye conditions and driving . How much time will I need off work? Most people will need some time off work, although this will depend to an extent on the type of work you do and the speed of recovery. Discuss this with your surgeon. What are the possible complications of macular hole surgery? It's unlikely you'll suffer harmful effects from a macular hole operation. However, you should be aware of the following possible complications. The hole may fail to close, but this normally won't have made your vision any worse, and it's usually possible to repeat the surgery. You'll almost certainly get a cataract after the surgery, usually within a year if you've not already had a cataract operation. This means the natural lens in your eye has gone cloudy. If you do already have a cataract, it may be removed at the same time the hole is being repaired. There's also a risk of retinal detachment , where the retina detaches from the back of the eye. This can potentially cause blindness, but it's usually repairable in a further operation. Bleeding occurs very rarely, but severe bleeding within the eye can result in blindness. Infection is another very rare complication. An infection needs further treatment and could lead to blindness. An increase in pressure within the eye is quite common in the days after macular hole surgery, usually due to the expanding gas bubble. In most cases, it's short lived and controlled with extra eye drops to reduce the pressure, protecting the eye from damage. If the high pressure is extreme or prolonged, there may be some damage to the optic nerve as a result. Can I develop a macular hole in my other eye? After carefully examining your other eye, your surgeon should be able to tell you the risk of developing a macular hole in this eye. In some people this is extremely unlikely, in others there's a 1 in 10 chance of developing a macular hole in the other eye. It's very important to monitor any changes in the vision of your healthy eye and report these to your eye specialist, GP or optician urgently. How does it differ from age-related macular degeneration (AMD)? A macular hole is not the same as macular degeneration, although they affect the same area of the eye and can sometimes both be present in the same eye. AMD is damage to the macula leading to the gradual loss of central vision. It's unclear what causes it, but getting older, smoking and a family history of the condition are known to increase your risk. Page last reviewed: 11 July 2024 Next review due: 11 July 2027"

Check if you're at risk of malaria Malaria is caused by being bitten by an infected mosquito. It can take just 1 bite to get it. The infection is very common in certain parts of the world. It's found in tropical regions, including: large areas of Africa and Asia Central and South America Dominican Republic and Haiti parts of the Middle East some Pacific islands Malaria is not found in the UK and you cannot catch it from another person. Information: Check before you travel It's important to check the malaria risk for the country you're travelling to before you go. You're still at risk of getting malaria if you now live in the UK but were born or used to live in a high-risk country. You will not be immune to malaria anymore. Find out more about the risk of malaria in specific countries on the Travel Health Pro website How to avoid malaria If you're travelling to an area where malaria is found, get advice from a GP, nurse, pharmacist or travel clinic before you go. It's best to do this at least 4 to 6 weeks before you travel, but you can still get advice at the last minute if you need to. You may be prescribed antimalarial tablets to reduce the risk of getting malaria and told how you can prevent mosquito bites. Do take any antimalarial medicine you're prescribed – you usually need to start taking it a few days or weeks before you go, until a few weeks after you get back use insect repellent on your skin – make sure it's 50% DEET-based sleep under mosquito nets treated with insecticide wear long-sleeved clothing and trousers to cover your arms and legs in the evening, when mosquitos are most active Information: Who's most at risk It's especially important to get advice before you travel if you're at higher risk of getting seriously ill from malaria. This includes: if you're pregnant young children people aged over 65 if you have a weak immune system if you have no spleen You may be prescribed antimalarial medicine even if you're travelling to a low-risk area. Symptoms of malaria Malaria can be hard to spot, but symptoms include: a high temperature, sweats and chills headaches and feeling confused feeling very tired and sleepy (especially in children) feeling and being sick, tummy pain and diarrhoea loss of appetite muscle pains yellow skin or whites of the eyes a sore throat, cough and difficulty breathing These symptoms usually appear between 7 and 18 days after you've been bitten by an infected mosquito. But sometimes you may not have symptoms for months after travel, and rarely years. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have travelled to a country where malaria is found and have malaria symptoms You should also tell anyone you travelled with to get help straight away. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Get medical advice quickly if you have malaria symptoms while you're travelling. Treatments for malaria Malaria is an emergency and needs to be treated quickly. It's treated with antimalarial medicines. Some people will stay in hospital to have specialist care and treatment. Malaria can sometimes come back and will need to be treated again if this happens. Page last reviewed: 18 February 2022 Next review due: 18 February 2025"

    "text": "The 'male menopause' Some men develop depression, loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and other physical and emotional symptoms when they reach their late 40s to early 50s. Other symptoms common in men this age are: mood swings and irritability loss of muscle mass and reduced ability to exercise fat redistribution, such as developing a large belly or \"man boobs\" ( gynaecomastia ) a general lack of enthusiasm or energy difficulty sleeping ( insomnia ) or increased tiredness poor concentration and short-term memory These symptoms can interfere with everyday life and happiness, so it's important to find the underlying cause and work out what can be done to resolve it. Is there such a thing as a \"male menopause\"? The \"male menopause\" (sometimes called the andropause) is an unhelpful term sometimes used in the media. This label is misleading because it suggests the symptoms are the result of a sudden drop in testosterone in middle age, similar to what occurs in the female menopause . This is not true. Although testosterone levels fall as men age, the decline is steady at about 1% a year from around the age of 30 to 40, and this is unlikely to cause any problems in itself. A testosterone deficiency that develops later in life, also known as late-onset hypogonadism, can sometimes be responsible for these symptoms, but in many cases the symptoms are nothing to do with hormones. Personal or lifestyle issues Lifestyle factors or psychological problems can also be responsible for many of these symptoms. For example, erectile dysfunction , low sex drive and mood swings may be the result of: stress depression anxiety There are also physical causes of erectile dysfunction, such as smoking or heart problems, which may happen alongside any psychological cause. Psychological problems are typically brought on by work or relationship issues, money problems or worrying about ageing parents. A \"midlife crisis\" can also be responsible. This can happen when men think they have reached life's halfway stage. Anxieties over what they have accomplished so far, either in their job or personal life, can lead to a period of depression. Other possible causes of the \"male menopause\" include: lack of sleep a poor diet lack of exercise drinking too much alcohol smoking low self-esteem Late-onset hypogonadism In some cases, where lifestyle or psychological problems do not seem to be responsible, the symptoms of the \"male menopause\" may be the result of hypogonadism, where the testes produce few or no hormones. Hypogonadism is sometimes present from birth, which can cause symptoms like delayed puberty and small testes. Hypogonadism can also occasionally develop later in life, particularly in men who are obese or have type 2 diabetes . This is known as late-onset hypogonadism and can cause the \"male menopause\" symptoms. But this is an uncommon and specific medical condition that's not a normal part of ageing. A diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism can usually be made based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests used to measure your testosterone levels. What to do If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, see your GP. They'll ask about your work and personal life to see if your symptoms may be caused by a mental health issue, such as stress or anxiety. If stress or anxiety are affecting you, you may benefit from medication or a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . Exercise and relaxation can also help. Read about: stress management treating anxiety help for low mood and depression exercise for depression breathing exercises for stress Do I need hormone replacement therapy (HRT)? Your GP may also order a blood test to measure your testosterone levels. If the results suggest you have a testosterone deficiency, you may be referred to an endocrinologist, a specialist in hormone problems. If the specialist confirms this diagnosis, you may be offered testosterone replacement to correct the hormone deficiency, which should relieve your symptoms. This treatment may be given as an injection or a gel. Page last reviewed: 13 October 2022 Next review due: 13 October 2025"

MARAZZI / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY : https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1063101/view Your finger may also be: painful or tender swollen or bruised Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if: You've injured your finger and: you cannot straighten it it's painful or tender it's swollen or bruised You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Things you can do before you get medical help If you think you have mallet finger, there are some things you can do while waiting for medical help. Do lift your hand up to reduce swelling take painkillers to help ease the pain remove any rings from the finger Treatment for mallet finger If you have mallet finger, the finger needs to be kept straight to let the injury heal. A doctor or nurse will put the finger in a splint, securing it with tape. You'll still be able to bend your finger at the middle joint. You'll need to: keep the splinted finger dry – the skin inside the splint can be sore if it gets wet wear the splint for up to 8 weeks, only removing it to clean your finger and the splint If the injury does not heal, you may need to wear the splint again for another 8 weeks. Rarely, you may need surgery. Cleaning the finger and splint Clean the finger and splint every day. It's easier to do this if someone can help you. It's important to keep the fingertip straight when the splint is off. Rest your finger flat on a table. Cut the tape and slide the splint off your finger. Wash the finger and the splint with soap and water. Dry the finger and splint. Slide the splint back into place over your finger, keeping the finger straight. Put new tape on. The middle joint of your finger can move, but it's important the damaged joint cannot move.

    "text": "Overview - Malnutrition Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Malnutrition is a serious condition that happens when your diet does not contain the right amount of nutrients. It means \"poor nutrition\" and can refer to: undernutrition – not getting enough nutrients overnutrition – getting more nutrients than needed These pages focus on undernutrition in adults or children. Read about obesity for more about the problems associated with overnutrition. Signs and symptoms of malnutrition Common signs of malnutrition include: unintentional weight loss – losing 5% to 10% or more of weight over 3 to 6 months is one of the main signs of malnutrition a low body weight – people with a body mass index (BMI) under 18.5 are at risk of being malnourished (use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI) a lack of interest in eating and drinking feeling tired all the time feeling weak getting ill often and taking a long time to recover in children, not growing or not putting on weight at the expected rate Read more about the symptoms of malnutrition . When to see a GP See a GP if: you've unintentionally lost a lot of weight over the last 3 to 6 months you have other symptoms of malnutrition you're worried someone in your care, such as a child or older person, may be malnourished If you're concerned about a friend or family member, try to encourage them to see a GP. A GP can check if you're at risk of malnutrition by measuring your weight and height, and asking about any medical problems you have or any recent changes in your weight or appetite. If they think you could be malnourished, they may refer you to a healthcare professional such as a dietitian to discuss treatment. Who's at risk of malnutrition Malnutrition is a common problem that affects millions of people in the UK. Anyone can become malnourished, but it's more common in people who: have a long-term health conditions that affect appetite, weight and/or how well nutrients are absorbed by the gut, such as Crohn's disease have problems swallowing (dysphagia) are socially isolated, have limited mobility, or a low income need extra energy, such as people with cystic fibrosis , are recovering from a serious injury or burns, and those with tremors or shaking hands People who are 65 years and over are particularly at risk, and weight loss is not an inevitable result of old age. Children under the age of five are also at risk. Read more about the causes of malnutrition . Treatments for malnutrition Treatment for malnutrition depends on your general health and how severely malnourished you are. The first dietary advice is usually to: eat \"fortified\" foods that are high in calories and protein snack between meals have drinks that contain lots of calories Some people also need support with underlying issues such as limited mobility. For example, care at home or occupational therapy . If a child is malnourished, their family or carers may need advice and support to address the underlying reasons why it happened. If these initial dietary changes are not enough, a doctor, nurse or dietitian may also suggest you take extra nutrients in the form of nutritional drinks or supplements. If you have difficulty eating and this cannot be managed by making changes such as eating soft or liquid foods, other treatments may be recommended, such as: a feeding tube – this can be either passed down your nose and into your stomach, or inserted directly into your stomach through the skin of the tummy nutrition that's given directly into a vein Read more about how malnutrition is treated . Preventing malnutrition The best way to prevent malnutrition is to eat a healthy, balanced diet. You need to eat a variety of foods from the main food groups, including: plenty of fruit and vegetables plenty of starchy foods such as bread, rice, potatoes, pasta some milk and diary foods or non-dairy alternatives some sources of protein, such as meat, fish, eggs and beans The Eatwell Guide has more information about the types of food you should include in your diet and how to get the right balance between them all. Speak to a GP or specialist if you have a health problem that puts you at increased risk of malnutrition. You may have more complex dietary needs or need to take supplements.

    "title": "Maple syrup urine disease",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/maple-syrup-urine-disease/",
    "text": "Maple syrup urine disease Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare but serious inherited condition. It means the body cannot process certain amino acids (the \"building blocks\" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods such as meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that are not needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with MSUD are unable to break down amino acids called leucine, isoleucine and valine. Very high levels of these amino acids are harmful. One of the characteristic symptoms of MSUD is sweet-smelling urine, which gives the condition its name. At around 5 days old, babies are offered newborn blood spot screening to check for inherited conditions like MSUD. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test. If your baby is diagnosed with MSUD, treatment should be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the outcome can be greatly improved. However, treatment for MSUD must be continued for life. Without treatment, severe, life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma . Some children with untreated MSUD are also at risk of brain damage and developmental delay. Symptoms of MSUD usually appear within the first few days or weeks after birth. More general symptoms include: sweet-smelling urine and sweat poor feeding or loss of appetite weight loss Babies with MSUD may also have episodes known as a \"metabolic crisis\", sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include: lack of energy vomiting irritability breathing difficulties It's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help you recognise the signs. Some babies with MSUD might not develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis until later in their first year, or later in childhood. The hospital will provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps prevent these symptoms developing. Diet Children diagnosed with MSUD are first referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. They may need to take medicine too. The diet is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids received, especially leucine, valine and isoleucine. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Some children need to take supplements of isoleucine and valine alongside the prescribed diet. This helps to maintain a healthy level of these amino acids in the blood without causing harm. Blood tests are needed to monitor these levels. Breast milk and baby formula also need to be monitored and measured before feeding your baby, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby formula contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. People with MSUD need to follow a low-protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce the risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and will stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Emergency treatment If your child becomes ill, they might have an episode of a metabolic crisis. This can lead to serious illness and long-term brain damage, and can be life threatening. It's possible to reduce this risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill. Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions for a low-protein diet and dietary supplements. This may include replacing milk and foods containing protein with special high-sugar drinks and taking amino acid supplements. When to visit the hospital Take your child to hospital if the symptoms of a metabolic crisis develop, if they cannot keep down their emergency diet and supplements, or they have repeated diarrhoea. Contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you're heading straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department . Take any information you have been given about MSUD in the event of an emergency in case the doctors have not seen MSUD before. Once you are in hospital, your child can be monitored and treated with fluids given directly into a vein (intravenous fluids). Liver transplant A liver transplant is sometimes an option to treat MSUD. If a person with MSUD receives a donated liver, they'll no longer be at risk of a metabolic crisis and can have a normal diet. Having a liver transplant is a major procedure with its own risks. You will have to take medicine to suppress the immune system (immunosuppressant medication) for the rest of your life to stop your body rejecting the new liver. It's important to consider all the pros and cons before deciding whether or not to have a liver transplant. Your doctor will be able to discuss whether this is a suitable option. The genetic change (mutation) responsible for MSUD is passed on by the parents, who usually do not have any symptoms of the condition. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the altered genes to develop the condition – one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one mutated gene, they'll just be a carrier of MSUD. If you're a carrier of the affected genes and have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has: a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of MSUD a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it's not possible to prevent MSUD, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition, so that tests and treatment are given as soon as possible. You may also wish to consider genetic and genomic testing . This might lead to a referral for genetic counselling, which offers support, information and advice about genetic conditions. If your child has MSUD, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Overview - Marfan syndrome Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Marfan syndrome is a disorder of the body's connective tissues, a group of tissues that maintain the structure of the body and support internal organs and other tissues. Children usually inherit the disorder from 1 of their parents. Some people are only mildly affected by Marfan syndrome, while others develop more serious symptoms. Typical characteristics of Marfan syndrome include: being tall abnormally long and slender limbs, fingers and toes (arachnodactyly) heart defects lens dislocation – where the lens of the eye falls into an abnormal position Find out more about the symptoms of Marfan syndrome What causes Marfan syndrome? Marfan syndrome is hereditary, which means it can be passed to a child from a parent who's affected. In around 3 in 4 cases, Marfan syndrome is inherited from 1 parent. The syndrome is autosomal dominant, which means a child can inherit it even if only 1 parent has the syndrome. There is therefore a 1 in 2 chance that the child of a parent with Marfan syndrome will inherit the syndrome. The gene defect leads to reduced production of a protein called fibrillin, resulting in parts of the body being able to stretch abnormally when placed under any kind of stress. The defective fibrillin gene also causes some bones to grow longer than they should. This means a person with Marfan syndrome may be tall because their arms and legs grow longer than normal. In the remaining 1 in 4 cases, neither parent has the syndrome. In these cases, the fibrillin gene changes (mutates) for the first time in the parent's egg or sperm. The mutated gene can be passed on to the child, who will then go on to develop the syndrome. Find out more about genetic inheritance Diagnosing Marfan syndrome Diagnosing Marfan syndrome can be difficult as the symptoms can vary significantly from person to person. As the symptoms of Marfan syndrome do not always develop during childhood, it may not be identified until the teenage years. In most cases, a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is based on a thorough physical examination and a detailed assessment of a person's medical and family history. Find out more about how Marfan syndrome is diagnosed Treating Marfan syndrome There's no cure for Marfan syndrome, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and reducing the risk of complications. As Marfan syndrome affects several different parts of the body, you'll be treated by a team of different healthcare professionals. You'll be closely monitored and any complications will be treated if they occur. A serious problem caused by Marfan syndrome can occur if the heart and the aorta, the body's main artery, are significantly affected. This can lead to a reduction in the number of years a person is expected to live. Find out more about the possible treatments for Marfan syndrome Information about you If you or your child has Marfan syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps researchers to better understand congenital and rare diseases to help make sure that people living with these conditions receive the best possible care. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register How common is Marfan syndrome? Although Marfan syndrome is rare, affecting about 1 in 5,000 people in the UK, it's one of the most common connective tissue disorders. Men and women are affected equally.

    "text": "Mastitis Mastitis is when your breast becomes swollen, hot and painful. It is most common in breastfeeding women and does not usually need medical treatment. Symptoms of mastitis Mastitis usually only affects 1 breast, and symptoms often come on quickly. They include: a swollen area on your breast that may feel hot and painful to touch – the area may become red but this can be harder to see if you have black or brown skin a wedge-shaped breast lump or a hard area on your breast a burning pain in your breast that might be constant or only when you breastfeed nipple discharge , which may be white or contain streaks of blood You may also get flu -like symptoms, such as aches, a high temperature, chills and tiredness. Things you can do to ease mastitis Do if you are breastfeeding, continue to breastfeed your baby when they want and for as long as they want. You can also offer your baby a breastfeed if your breasts are uncomfortably full when breastfeeding make sure your baby is positioned and attached properly . Your midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist can advise you. a cloth soaked in warm water and applied to the breast (or a shower or bath) may improve milk flow – do not apply a lot of heat as this may increase inflammation breast pain may be soothed using a cold compress (for example a cloth soaked in cold water) rest and drink lots of fluids take paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce any pain or high temperature Don’t do not wear tight-fitting clothing or bras until you feel better do not take aspirin do not express more milk than your baby needs do not apply firm pressure to the breast - any pressure should be gentle do not stop breastfeeding suddenly –  find out how to stop breastfeeding do not apply oils, soaks or creams to your breast Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your symptoms do not get better 12 to 24 hours after treating it at home your symptoms do not get better 48 hours after taking antibiotics you get mastitis and you are not breastfeeding Treatment for mastitis from a GP A GP will usually prescribe antibiotics if you have mastitis and your symptoms are not getting better. If you're breastfeeding a very small amount of the antibiotic may go into your breast milk. There is no risk to your baby, but it might make them irritable and restless. What to do if mastitis comes back If you are breastfeeding and keep getting mastitis, it might be due to problems with positioning and attaching . If you have any breastfeeding problems , it's important to ask for help from a midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist as soon as possible. Information: You can also call the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212 (9.30am to 9.30pm, daily) Causes of mastitis Mastitis is common in breastfeeding women as it can be caused by a build-up of milk. Women who are not breastfeeding can also get mastitis, as can men. This can be caused by: smoking – toxins found in tobacco can damage breast tissue damage to the nipple, such as a piercing or skin condition such as eczema having a breast implant having a weakened immune system due to a health condition such as diabetes shaving or plucking hairs from around your nipples Page last reviewed: 17 March 2023 Next review due: 17 March 2026"

    "title": "Overview-Mastocytosis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mastocytosis/",
    "text": "Overview - Mastocytosis Contents Overview Symptoms Treatment Mastocytosis is a rare condition caused by an excess number of mast cells gathering in the body's tissues. There are 2 main types of mastocytosis: cutaneous mastocytosis, which mainly affects children – where mast cells gather in the skin, but are not found in large numbers elsewhere in the body systemic mastocytosis, which mainly affects adults – where mast cells gather in body tissues, such as the skin, internal organs and bones There are also several subtypes of systemic mastocytosis, depending on the symptoms. Mast cells Mast cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue found in the hollow centres of some bones, and live longer than normal cells. They're an important part of the immune system and help fight infection. When mast cells detect a substance that triggers an allergic reaction (an allergen), they release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream. Histamine makes the blood vessels expand and the surrounding skin itchy and swollen. It can also create a build-up of mucus in the airways, which become narrower. Symptoms of mastocytosis The symptoms of mastocytosis can vary depending on the type. Cutaneous mastocytosis The most common symptom of cutaneous mastocytosis is abnormal growths (lesions) on the skin, such as bumps and spots, which can form on the body and sometimes blister. Systemic mastocytosis Some people with systemic mastocytosis may experience episodes of severe symptoms, often with specific triggers such as physical exertion or stress. Many people do not have any problems. During an episode you may have: skin reactions – such as itching and flushing gut symptoms – such as diarrhoea and vomiting muscle and joint pain mood changes, headaches and tiredness (fatigue) There are 3 main subtypes of systemic mastocytosis. They are: indolent systemic mastocytosis – symptoms are usually mild to moderate and vary from person to person; indolent systemic mastocytosis accounts for around 90% of adult systemic mastocytosis cases aggressive mastocytosis – where mast cells multiply in organs, such as the spleen, liver and digestive system; the symptoms are more wide-ranging and severe, although skin lesions are less common systemic mastocytosis with associated blood (haematological) disease – where a condition that affects the blood cells, such as chronic leukaemia , also develops Severe allergic reaction People with mastocytosis have an increased risk of developing a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. This is known as anaphylaxis . The increased risk of anaphylaxis is caused by the abnormally high number of mast cells and their potential to release large amounts of histamine into the blood. If you or your child has mastocytosis, you may need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector, which can be used to treat the symptoms of anaphylaxis . Read more about the symptoms of mastocytosis . Causes of mastocytosis The cause or causes of mastocytosis are not fully known, but there's thought to be an association with a change in genes known as the KIT mutation. The KIT mutation makes the mast cells more sensitive to the effects of a signalling protein called stem cell factor (SCF). SCF plays an important role in stimulating the production and survival of certain cells, such as blood cells and mast cells, inside the bone marrow. In very few cases of mastocytosis it appears the KIT mutation is passed down through families. However, in most cases the mutation happens for no apparent reason. Diagnosing mastocytosis A physical examination of the skin is the first stage in diagnosing cutaneous mastocytosis. Your GP or skin specialist (dermatologist) may rub the affected areas of skin to see if they become red, inflamed and itchy. This is known as Darier's sign. It's usually possible to confirm a diagnosis by carrying out a biopsy , where a small skin sample is taken and checked for mast cells. The following tests are commonly used to look for systemic mastocytosis: blood tests – including a full blood count (FBC) and measuring blood tryptase levels an ultrasound scan to look for enlargement of the liver and spleen if it seems likely a DEXA scan to measure bone density a bone marrow biopsy test – where a local anaesthetic is used and a long needle is inserted through the skin into the bone underneath, usually in the pelvis A diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis is usually made by finding typical changes on a bone marrow biopsy. Treating mastocytosis There's no cure for mastocytosis, so the aim of treatment is to try to relieve the symptoms. Treatment options will depend on the type of mastocytosis and the severity of the symptoms. Mild to moderate cases of cutaneous mastocytosis can be treated with steroid cream ( topical corticosteroids ) for a short time. Steroid cream reduces the number of mast cells that can release histamine and trigger swelling (inflammation) in the skin. Antihistamines can also be used to treat the symptoms of cutaneous or indolent mastocytosis, such as red skin and itchiness. Antihistamines are a type of medicine that block the effects of histamine and are often used to treat allergic conditions. Read more about treating mastocytosis . Complications of mastocytosis In children, the symptoms of cutaneous mastocytosis usually improve over time, but remain stable in adults. In many cases the condition gets better on its own by the time a child has reached puberty. The outlook for systemic mastocytosis can vary, depending on the type you have. Indolent systemic mastocytosis should not affect life expectancy, but other types can. A few people develop a serious blood condition, such as chronic leukaemia, over their lifetime.

You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . What happens at your GP appointment Mastoiditis is a serious infection and should be diagnosed and treated quickly. If you have symptoms of mastoiditis, a GP will use a small magnifying lens called an otoscope to check for infection inside the ear. If the GP thinks you have mastoiditis, they'll refer you to an ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist at a hospital. Sometimes a scan may be needed to show the mastoid bone in more detail. Treatments for mastoiditis If you have mastoiditis, you'll be treated by an ear specialist in hospital. The main treatment is antibiotics . These are given directly into a vein through a drip (intravenously). You'll usually need to stay in hospital for 1 or 2 days to make sure the antibiotics are working. If your symptoms start to get better, you may be given antibiotic tablets to take at home. If antibiotics do not work or the infection gets worse, you may need: treatment to drain pus from your ear using a needle or by making a small cut in or behind the ear surgery to remove part of the mastoid bone (mastoidectomy) Page last reviewed: 23 March 2023 Next review due: 23 March 2026"

    "title": "MCADD",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mcadd/",
    "text": "MCADD MCADD is a rare genetic condition where a person has problems breaking down fat to use as an energy source. This means that someone with MCADD can become very ill if their body's energy demands exceed their energy intake, such as during infections or vomiting illnesses when they're unable to eat. Problems occur because fat is only partially broken down, which leads to a lack of energy and a build-up of harmful substances in the body. MCADD is a lifelong condition that's present from birth. It is usually picked up using the newborn blood spot test . MCADD stands for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Is MCADD serious? MCADD is a potentially serious condition that can be life-threatening if not recognised quickly and treated appropriately. However, most cases are picked up soon after birth and can be managed quite easily. With proper care, there's no reason why someone with MCADD cannot live a normal, healthy and active life. Symptoms of MCADD Babies with MCADD are at risk of developing the following symptoms: irritability poor feeding sleepiness floppiness breathing difficulties vomiting seizures (fits) coma If your baby is ill or is not feeding well, they should be given a special high-sugar drink, known as glucose polymer. This is called the emergency regimen. Families with a child with MCADD are taught how to prepare and give the emergency regimen. If you see no improvement after giving the emergency regimen, you should take your child to your nearest A&E department immediately. Take any relevant paperwork about your child's MCADD with you and tell hospital staff your child has MCADD. It's also helpful to contact your specialist care team to say you are on your way but do not delay going to hospital. What causes MCADD? MCADD is caused by a fault in the gene that provides the instructions to make an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). This genetic fault causes the enzyme to either not work properly or be missing entirely, which means the body cannot fully break down fat to release energy. If the body needs to break down fat quickly (for example, if you're unwell and have not eaten for a while), energy cannot be produced quickly enough to meet the body's needs and substances created when fat is partially broken down can build up to harmful levels in the body. This can lead to serious problems if not treated quickly. How MCADD is inherited A child will only be born with MCADD if they inherit a copy of the faulty gene that causes it from both of their parents. The parents will not normally have the condition themselves because they usually only have one copy of the faulty gene each. This is known as being a \"carrier\". If both parents are carriers of the faulty gene, there's a: 1 in 4 chance each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and will not have MCADD or be able to pass it on 1 in 2 chance each child they have will just inherit a copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier 1 in 4 chance each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have MCADD Read more about genetic and genomic testing Screening and testing for MCADD A newborn blood spot test is now offered to all babies in England to earlier help detect problems including MCADD. When your baby is 5 to 8 days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate MCADD. You should receive the results by the time your baby is 6 to 8 weeks old. You'll be contacted sooner if a problem is found so you can attend a hospital appointment to discuss this further. If your baby has a screen positive result, further urine and blood tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes MCADD. If you've previously had a child with MCADD, the newborn blood spot test should be carried out within 24 to 48 hours of birth. How MCADD is treated There's no specific treatment for MCADD. A specialist care team will give you advice about how to look after your child and support them as they get older. They will also: arrange regular follow-up appointments provide you with contact details for your specialist care team and written information Children and adults with MCADD can eat a normal diet, as long as they: frequently take special high-sugar drinks when they're ill – this includes common illnesses such as a high temperature, diarrhoea, or vomiting avoid long periods without eating during the newborn period and infancy even when well – the length of time your child can go without eating is known as the maximum \"safe fasting time\" and it varies depending on age; you'll be given advice about this The high-sugar drinks used for treating MCADD are available on prescription from a GP. You'll be advised by a specialist dietitian about when to use them and how much to use. If the drinks do not help or your child refuses them, they may need to be treated in hospital. You can find more detailed information about MCADD treatment in the British Inherited Metabolic Diseases Group (BIMDG) MCADD information sheet for parents and carers (PDF, 116kb) .

See other rashes in babies and children Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you think you or your child may have measles your child is under 1 year old and has come into contact with someone who has measles you've been in close contact with someone who has measles and you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system you or your child have a high temperature that has not come down after taking paracetamol or ibuprofen you or your child have difficulty breathing – you may feel more short of breath than usual your baby or young child is not feeding well, or taking less feeds or fluids than usual you or your child are peeing less than usual (or your baby has fewer wet nappies) you or your child feels very unwell, or you're worried something is seriously wrong Measles can spread to others easily. Call your GP surgery before you go in. They may suggest talking over the phone. You can also call 111 or get help from 111 online . How to look after yourself or your child Measles usually starts to get better in about a week. After seeing a GP, there are things you can do to help ease the symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection. It can help to: rest and drink plenty fluids, such as water, to avoid dehydration take paracetamol or ibuprofen for a high temperature give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen if they're distressed or uncomfortable – check the packaging or leaflet to make sure the medicine is suitable for your child, or speak to a pharmacist or GP if you're not sure use cotton wool soaked in warm water to gently remove any crusts from your or your child's eyes Important Stay off nursery, school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears. Also try to avoid close contact with babies and anyone who is pregnant or has a weakened immune system. How to avoid spreading or catching measles Measles is spread when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. You’re infectious from when you first have symptoms (around 4 days before the rash appears) until 4 days after you get the rash. There are things you can do to reduce the risk of spreading or catching measles. Do wash your hands often with soap and warm water use tissues when you cough or sneeze throw used tissues in the bin Don’t do not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, or bedding Complications of measles Measles can lead to serious problems if it spreads to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain. Problems that can be caused by measles include: pneumonia meningitis blindness seizures (fits) These problems are rare, but some people are more at risk. This includes babies and people with weakened immune systems. Measles in pregnancy If you get measles when you're pregnant, it could harm your baby. It can cause: miscarriage or stillbirth premature birth (before the 37th week of pregnancy) your baby having a low birthweight It's important to get medical advice if you're pregnant and have been in close contact with someone who has measles. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You or your child has measles and: have a seizure (fit) severe difficulty breathing – you're gasping, choking or not able to get words out (babies may make grunting noises or their stomach may suck under their ribcage) are unable to stay awake – cannot keep their eyes open for more than a few seconds suddenly become confused – your child may be very unsettled, behaving differently, or crying non-stop your child is limp, floppy or not responding normally – their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head and focus on your face a rash that does not fade when you press a glass against it a stiff neck, or find light uncomfortable or painful Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Get vaccinated against measles The MMR vaccine can prevent measles. It also protects you from mumps and rubella . The MMR vaccine is offered to all children in the UK. 2 doses can give lifelong protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. Ask at your GP surgery if you're not sure you or your child have had the vaccine. They can give it for free on the NHS.

    "text": "Medically unexplained symptoms Many people have persistent physical symptoms, such as dizziness or pain, that don't appear to be caused by a medical condition. They are sometimes known as medically unexplained symptoms when they last for more than a few weeks, but doctors can't find a problem with the body that may be the cause. This doesn't mean the symptoms are faked or \"all in the head\" – they're real and can affect your ability to function properly. Not understanding the cause can make them even more distressing and difficult to cope with. Examples of medically unexplained symptoms Common medically unexplained symptoms include: pains in the muscles or joints back pain headaches tiredness feeling faint chest pain heart palpitations stomach problems Other, less common medically unexplained symptoms include: fits (seizures) breathlessness weakness and paralysis numbness and tingling About 1 in 4 people who see a GP have physical symptoms that cannot be explained. Possible causes of medically unexplained symptoms Many people with medically unexplained symptoms, such as tiredness, pain and heart palpitations , also have depression or anxiety . Treating an associated psychological problem can often relieve the physical symptoms. For others, the symptoms may be part of a poorly understood syndrome, such as: chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) – also known as ME irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) fibromyalgia (pain all over the body) functional neurological disorders (FNDs) – symptoms thought to be caused by nervous system problems rather than a physical condition The fact that doctors are unable to find a condition causing these symptoms isn't unusual in medicine, and it doesn't mean that nothing can be done to help you. How a GP can help A GP will aim to rule out all the possible conditions that might be causing your symptoms. You may have a thorough physical examination and blood tests . It's important to consider whether any medicine you're taking may be causing your symptoms – for example, taking painkillers long term can lead to headaches . The GP should also investigate whether you might have an associated problem, such as depression or anxiety. Physical symptoms can cause depression and anxiety, and these can in turn make the physical symptoms worse, creating a vicious circle. You should tell the GP: what your symptoms are like, when they started and what makes them better or worse what you think is the cause of your symptoms and your expectations of how tests and treatments might help how your symptoms affect what you can do – what they stop you doing how upsetting your symptoms are – how they make you feel There are a number of things you can do yourself that may help. You and the GP may identify some lifestyle changes and goals that you both think will help relieve your symptoms, such as regular physical activity and better rest. You may be referred for a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . The aim of CBT is to help you to manage your symptoms by enabling you to understand links between your symptoms, worries, feelings and how you cope. If your symptoms seem to be caused by a problem with the nervous system, you may be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in disorders of the nervous system). The neurologist may refer you for psychotherapy but will also consider other therapy options, such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy . Medicine such as antidepressants can be helpful, even if you're not depressed. However, medicine isn't always the answer – painkillers or sedatives, for example, may lead to dependence. The possible benefits of medicine always need to be weighed against the potential side effects. If you think you have an underlying condition that's been missed by your doctor, you can ask for a second opinion. Self-help There are things you can do to improve or even relieve some physical symptoms, such as taking regular exercise and managing stress. Regular exercise will help keep you fit and many people find that it also boosts their mood (learn about exercise for depression ). How much exercise you should do will depend on your current health and capabilities. Managing stress is very important because it's been linked to problems such as pain and IBS. Learn about breathing exercises for stress . Generally, planning some pleasurable personal time to unwind should help – whatever helps you relax, whether it's yoga classes, swimming, running, meditation or walking in the countryside. Find out about 5 steps to mental wellbeing Your body has a remarkable ability to recover and there's a good chance that your symptoms will improve in time, even without any specific treatment.

    "text": "Overview - Meningitis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Complications Vaccination Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges). It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. Meningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening sepsis and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves. A number of vaccinations are available that offer some protection against meningitis. Symptoms of meningitis Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include: a high temperature (fever) being sick a headache a rash that does not fade when a glass is rolled over it (but a rash will not always develop) a stiff neck a dislike of bright lights drowsiness or unresponsiveness seizures (fits) These symptoms can appear in any order. You do not always get all the symptoms. When to get medical help Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest A&E immediately if you think you or someone you look after could have meningitis or sepsis. Trust your instincts and do not wait for all the symptoms to appear or until a rash develops. Someone with meningitis or sepsis can get a lot worse very quickly. Call NHS 111 for advice if you're not sure if it's anything serious or you think you may have been exposed to someone with meningitis. If you've had medical advice and are still worried or any symptoms get worse, get medical help again. How meningitis is spread Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis. Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through: sneezing coughing kissing Meningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but are not ill themselves. It can also be caught from someone with meningitis, but this is less common. Vaccinations against meningitis Vaccinations offer some protection against certain causes of meningitis. These include the: MenB vaccine – offered to babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks and a booster at 1 year 6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age pneumococcal vaccine – 2 doses offered to babies at 12 weeks and 1 year, and a single dose offered to adults aged 65 or over Hib/MenC vaccine – offered to babies at 1 year of age MMR vaccine – offered to babies at 1 year and a second dose at 3 years and 4 months MenACWY vaccine – offered to teenagers, sixth formers and \"fresher\" students going to university for the first time Treatments for meningitis People with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection. Bacterial meningitis usually needs to be treated in hospital for at least a week. Treatments include: antibiotics given directly into a vein fluids given directly into a vein oxygen through a face mask Viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days and can often be treated at home. Getting plenty of rest and taking painkillers and anti-sickness medication can help relieve the symptoms in the meantime. Outlook for meningitis Viral meningitis will usually get better on its own and rarely causes any long-term problems. Most people with bacterial meningitis who are treated quickly will also make a full recovery, although some are left with serious long-term problems. These can include: hearing loss or vision loss , which may be partial or total problems with memory and concentration recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ) co-ordination, movement and balance problems loss of limbs – amputation of affected limbs is sometimes necessary Overall, it's estimated up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.

    "title": "Mesothelioma",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mesothelioma/",
    "text": "Mesothelioma Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body's organs. It's usually linked to asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles. More than 2,700 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year in the UK. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 and over, and men are affected more commonly than women. Unfortunately, it's not possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms. Symptoms of mesothelioma The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically do not appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos. Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs include: chest pain shortness of breath fatigue (extreme tiredness) a high temperature and sweating, particularly at night a persistent cough loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss clubbed (swollen) fingertips Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy include: tummy pain or swelling feeling or being sick loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss diarrhoea or constipation See a GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past. What causes mesothelioma? Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction. These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos. The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. But materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. Read more about asbestosis . How mesothelioma is diagnosed If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they'll refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests. A number of different tests may need to be carried out, including: an X-ray of your chest or tummy a CT scan – a number of X-ray images are taken to create a detailed image of the inside of the body fluid drainage – if there's a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that's inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or anaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysed These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it's spread. Treatments for mesothelioma The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health. As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. This is known as palliative or supportive care . Possible treatments include: chemotherapy – this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer radiotherapy – this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it's not clear whether surgery is helpful immunotherapy – this involves using a combination of 2 medicines to help stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells; immunotherapy cannot cure mesothelioma, but it can slow the spread of the disease and prolong lifespan You'll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain. Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you. Outlook for mesothelioma Unfortunately, the outlook for mesothelioma tends to be poor. This is because it does not usually cause any obvious symptoms until late on and can progress quite quickly once it reaches this stage. There are currently around 2,500 deaths from mesothelioma each year in the UK. This number is expected to drop in the future because asbestos was banned in 1999.

    "text": "Overview - Miscarriage Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis What happens Afterwards Prevention A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy during the first 23 weeks. Symptoms of a miscarriage The main sign of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding, which may be followed by cramping and pain in your lower abdomen. If you have vaginal bleeding, contact a GP or your midwife. Most GPs can refer you to an early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away if necessary. You may be referred to a maternity ward if your pregnancy is at a later stage. But bear in mind that light vaginal bleeding is relatively common during the first trimester (first 3 months) of pregnancy and does not necessarily mean you're having a miscarriage. Causes of a miscarriage There are potentially many reasons why a miscarriage may happen, although the cause is not usually identified. The majority are not caused by anything you have done. It's thought most miscarriages are caused by abnormal chromosomes in the baby. Chromosomes are genetic \"building blocks\" that guide the development of a baby. If a baby has too many or not enough chromosomes, it will not develop properly. In most cases, a miscarriage is a one-off event and most people go on to have a successful pregnancy in the future. Preventing a miscarriage The majority of miscarriages cannot be prevented. But there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of a miscarriage. Avoid smoking, drinking alcohol and using drugs while pregnant. Being a healthy weight before getting pregnant, eating a healthy diet and reducing your risk of infection can also help. What happens if you think you're having a miscarriage If you have the symptoms of a miscarriage, you'll usually be referred to a hospital for tests. In most cases, an ultrasound scan can determine if you're having a miscarriage. When a miscarriage is confirmed, you'll need to talk to your doctor or midwife about the options for the management of the end of the pregnancy. Often the pregnancy tissue will pass out naturally in 1 or 2 weeks. Sometimes medicine to assist the passage of the tissue may be recommended, or you can choose to have minor surgery to remove it if you do not want to wait. After a miscarriage A miscarriage can be an emotionally and physically draining experience. You may have feelings of guilt, shock and anger. Advice and support are available at this time from hospital counselling services and charity groups. You may also find it beneficial to have a memorial for the baby you lost. You can try for another baby as soon as your symptoms have settled and you're emotionally and physically ready. It's important to remember that most miscarriages are a one-off and are followed by a healthy pregnancy. How common are miscarriages? Miscarriages are much more common than most people realise. It's thought around 1 in 8 known pregnancies will end in miscarriage. Many miscarriages happen before someone knows they're pregnant. Losing 3 or more pregnancies in a row (recurrent miscarriages) is uncommon and only affects around 1 in 100 women. Page last reviewed: 09 March 2022 Next review due: 09 March 2025 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Molar pregnancy A molar pregnancy is when there's a problem with a fertilised egg, which means a baby and a placenta do not develop the way they should after conception. A molar pregnancy will not be able to survive. It happens by chance and is rare. Finding out you have a molar pregnancy A molar pregnancy may not have any symptoms, or you may have some symptoms of pregnancy . You may find out about a molar pregnancy during your 1st pregnancy ultrasound scan at around 8 to 14 weeks. Some people find out after their pregnancy ends with a miscarriage . Urgent advice: Call a midwife or GP if: You're pregnant and: you have any bleeding or a dark discharge from your vagina you're feeling or being sick often (severe morning sickness) you think your bump looks bigger than it should for your stage of pregnancy you have any other symptoms you're worried about Tests for a molar pregnancy If a midwife or doctor thinks you have a molar pregnancy, you'll need: blood tests to check your level of the pregnancy hormone hCG, which is usually higher than normal in a molar pregnancy an ultrasound scan an appointment with a specialist (gynaecologist) or at an early pregnancy assessment unit Finding out you have a molar pregnancy can be very difficult. A doctor or midwife can give you advice about the support that's available. Treatment for a molar pregnancy A molar pregnancy will not be able to survive. It may end on its own, with a miscarriage. If this does not happen, it's usually treated with a procedure to remove the pregnancy. You'll usually be given a general anaesthetic before the procedure, so you'll be asleep. Sometimes you might be able to take medicine to end a molar pregnancy. Follow-up care After treatment for a molar pregnancy you'll have regular blood and urine tests to check your hCG hormone level is returning to normal. Very rarely, molar pregnancy cells can remain in the womb and become cancerous (they start to grow or spread to other parts of the body). This is called an invasive mole or choriocarcinoma. If this happens, it can usually be successfully treated with chemotherapy . Cancer Research UK has more information about invasive mole and choriocarcinoma Sex, contraception, and trying for a baby after a molar pregnancy You can have sex as soon as you feel ready, but it's important to use contraception while you're getting follow-up care. Talk to a GP about what type of contraception is right for you. Having a molar pregnancy does not affect your chances of getting pregnant again. But it's important to wait until your doctor tells you it's safe before you start trying for a baby. Causes of a molar pregnancy A molar pregnancy happens by chance. It's not caused by either parent doing something wrong. You may be more likely to have a molar pregnancy if: you're a young teenager or over 45 years old when you get pregnant you've had a molar pregnancy before you have an Asian background Types of molar pregnancy A molar pregnancy is sometimes called a hydatidiform mole. There are 2 types of molar pregnancy: a complete molar pregnancy – this is where abnormal cells grow in the womb after conception and there's no sign of a baby a partial molar pregnancy – this is where there may be early signs of a baby, but it cannot fully develop or survive Where to find help and support for a molar pregnancy It can take time to recover after a molar pregnancy, both physically and emotionally. The specialists looking after you can give you advice if you need support. They may be able to recommend support services in your area.

    "text": "Mpox Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) is a rare infection most commonly found in parts of central and east Africa. The risk of catching it in the UK is low for most people. Mpox in the UK There have been a small number of cases of mpox in the UK since 2022. These have mainly been a type of mpox that may be milder (called Clade 2 mpox). Cases of the type of mpox that may be more serious (called Clade 1 mpox) are very rare in the UK. So far this type of mpox has mainly been found in countries across central and east Africa. The risk of catching mpox in the UK is low for most people. How you get mpox Mpox can be passed on from person to person through: any close physical contact with mpox blisters or scabs (including during sexual contact, kissing, cuddling or holding hands) touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with mpox the coughs or sneezes of a person with mpox when they're close to you In parts of central and east Africa, mpox can also be caught from infected rodents (such as rats, mice and squirrels) if: you're bitten you touch their fur, skin, blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs you eat their meat and it has not been cooked thoroughly Symptoms of mpox If you get infected with mpox, it usually takes between 5 and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. The first symptoms of mpox include: a high temperature (fever) a headache muscle aches backache swollen glands shivering (chills) exhaustion joint pain A rash usually appears 1 to 5 days after the first symptoms. It can be on any part of the body, including the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, mouth, genitals and anus. You may also have anal pain or bleeding from your bottom. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox . It starts as raised spots, which turn into sores (ulcers) or small blisters filled with fluid. The blisters eventually form scabs which later fall off. The symptoms usually clear up in a few weeks. While you have symptoms, you can pass mpox on to other people.

But if your symptoms are more severe and you become unwell, you will need treatment in hospital. The risk of needing treatment in hospital is higher for: older people young children people with a condition or who are taking a medicine that affects their immune system Because the infection can be passed on through close contact, it's important to isolate if you're told to do so. GOV.UK has further advice for people infected with mpox who are isolating at home Vaccination to protect against mpox Mpox is caused by an infection with the mpox virus. The mpox vaccine can give good protection against mpox. Who can have the mpox vaccine The NHS is offering the mpox vaccine to people who are at increased risk of catching mpox. You may be able to have the mpox vaccine if: you're a man who has sex with other men and you have multiple partners, participate in group sex or attend sex-on-premises venues (staff at these venues may also be eligible) you've had contact with someone who has mpox If you've had contact with someone who has mpox, the contact tracing team should contact you. They will check your risk of catching mpox and tell you if you need to have an mpox vaccine. How the mpox vaccine is given The mpox vaccine is given as an injection.

But if it gets inside the body, it can cause a serious infection that needs immediate treatment with antibiotics. Symptoms of MRSA Most people with MRSA bacteria on their skin do not have any symptoms. But if you get an MRSA infection under your skin, you may have an area of skin that: is painful and swollen feels warm when you touch it leaks pus or liquid looks red – though this may be harder to see on brown or black skin If the infection spreads to your blood or lungs, or another part of your body, symptoms may include: high temperature difficulty breathing chills dizziness confusion Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You have a cut or wound that: is painful, swollen or red feels warm when you touch it leaks pus or liquid These could be signs of a skin infection such as MRSA. Some skin infections can be serious, so they need to be checked quickly. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if somebody: is acting confused, has slurred speech and is not making sense has difficulty breathing, such as breathlessness or breathing very fast has blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet has a rash that does not fade when you roll a glass over it, the same as meningitis Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for MRSA MRSA can be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic tablets can be used for mild MRSA infections. More serious infections may need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics given by injection or a drip into a vein in your arm. You may need antibiotics for a few days or up to a few months, depending on how serious the infection is. If you get complications, you may need further treatment, such as surgery to drain a build-up of pus (abscess). Preventing MRSA infections People staying in care homes and hospitals (especially those having surgery) are at a higher risk of getting an MRSA infection. If you're visiting someone in a care home or hospital, follow any instructions you're given about washing or sanitising your hands. Testing for MRSA before going into hospital If you're due to have surgery, you may be offered a screening test for MRSA before you go into hospital. This usually involves wiping swabs (similar to cotton buds) on: the inside of your nostril the back of your mouth your groin The swabs are then sent for testing. If the result shows you have MRSA on your skin, you’ll need to treat it with a special nasal cream or spray, body wash and shampoo for around 5 to 10 days. You will be sent these items along with instructions on how to use them. Causes of MRSA infection MRSA usually lives harmlessly on the skin and mainly spreads through touch. This can happen if you touch a person with MRSA, or something they’ve touched. MRSA will only cause an infection if it spreads inside the body. MRSA infections can affect anyone, but you may be more at risk if you: have long stays in hospital (especially if you’re being treated for a serious condition) have a break or opening in your skin, for example for a drip into a vein, a cut from surgery, a serious burn or wound, or other damage to your skin have a weakened immune system (for example, because of a condition such as HIV or treatment such as chemotherapy) Video: MRSA This video explains how MRSA is caught, what happens when you have it and how to prevent infection.

This can lead to a wide range of problems with muscle control and movement. It cannot currently be cured, but treatments are available to help manage the symptoms. Symptoms of multiple system atrophy (MSA) The main symptom of multiple system atrophy (MSA) is losing control of muscles in the body. This happens gradually in some people and quickly in others. MSA affects people in different ways, depending on which muscles are affected. Some of the most common symptoms include: bladder problems, such as needing to pee more often or being unable to pee feeling dizzy and faint when standing up erectile dysfunction (impotence) slow, clumsy or unsteady movement slurred speech stiff, tense muscles that may be painful It can also cause a wide range of other symptoms, such as: feeling too hot or too cold trouble sleeping noisy breathing, unintentional sighing and snoring finding it difficult to chew or swallow constipation (finding it hard to poo) unpredictable laughing or crying The symptoms of MSA most often begin in people over 50 years old.

    "title": "Overview-Mumps",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mumps/",
    "text": "Overview - Mumps Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Complications Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine. Symptoms of mumps Mumps is most recognisable by the painful swellings in the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive \"hamster face\" appearance. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/89260/view Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain, and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. When to see a GP It's important to contact a GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. While mumps is not usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis . Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the person's temperature to see if it's higher than normal. Let your GP know in advance if you're coming to the surgery so they can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection. If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection team (HPT). The HPT will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Find your local health protection team on GOV.UK How mumps is spread Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose. A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it's important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated. If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by: regularly washing your hands with soap using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze avoiding school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms first develop Preventing mumps You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they're given the combined MMR vaccine for mumps, measles and rubella. The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule . Your child should be given 1 dose when they're around 12 to 13 months and a second booster dose at 3 years and 4 months. Once both doses are given, the vaccine provides around 88% protection against mumps. Anyone who did not have both doses of the MMR vaccine as a child can contact a GP to arrange to be vaccinated. Treatment for mumps There's currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within 1 or 2 weeks. Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes: getting plenty of bed rest and fluids using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol – aspirin should not be given to children under 16 applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain Complications Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person's health. Serious complications are rare. But mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles or ovaries (if the affected person has gone through puberty). Find out more about the complications of mumps Who's affected Most cases of mumps occur in younger adults who did not receive the MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule and did not have mumps as a child. Older adults who were born in the UK before the vaccine was introduced are likely to have had mumps as a child. Once you have been infected by the mumps virus, you normally develop a life-long immunity to further infection. The MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988. Adults born between 1980 and 1990 may not have been vaccinated as children, and are less likely than older adults to have had mumps as a child. Mumps is currently most common among people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s who missed out on the MMR vaccine as children.

    "text": "Muscular dystrophy Muscular dystrophy is a rare genetic condition that causes muscle weakness that gets worse over time. There is currently no cure, but treatment can help with symptoms. Symptoms of muscular dystrophy The main symptom of muscular dystrophy is muscle weakness that gets worse as you get older. The symptoms you have and the age when they begin can vary. Some types of muscular dystrophy start in early childhood, while others do not start until later in life. Signs can include: difficulty walking difficulty lifting things falling easily muscle pain tightness in the joints In young children, symptoms can include floppiness and taking longer than expected to crawl or walk. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child have symptoms of muscular dystrophy you're worried about your child's development you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy and someone in your or your partner's family has muscular dystrophy Types of muscular dystrophy There are many different types of muscular dystrophy. The type of muscular dystrophy you have affects: your symptoms and how severe they are – some types are quite mild, while others will have a significant impact on your life when your symptoms begin – some types begin in early childhood, others begin later in life how quickly your symptoms get worse (progress) The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which begins in early childhood, usually only affects boys, and progresses quickly. Information: Find out more Muscular Dystrophy UK: what is muscular dystrophy Causes of muscular dystrophy Muscular dystrophy is a genetic condition, which means it's caused by an altered gene. Different genes cause different types of muscular dystrophy. The altered gene can be passed on from your parents (inherited), or you can be born with it even if your parents do not have it. If someone in your family has been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, genetic testing can help you find out if you have the gene that causes it. Information: Find out more Muscular Dystrophy UK: understanding the role of inheritance and genetics in muscle wasting conditions How muscular dystrophy is diagnosed If a GP thinks you or your child may have muscular dystrophy, they'll usually refer you to a specialist for tests. More than one test may be needed to confirm a diagnosis or to identify the type. Tests you might have include: a blood test a genetic test for a gene that causes muscular dystrophy an electromyogram (EMG), where a small needle is inserted into a muscle to check the electrical activity in the muscle a muscle biopsy , where a small piece of muscle tissue is removed and tested an MRI scan of the muscles Diagnosing muscular dystrophy in pregnancy If there's a chance you could have a child with muscular dystrophy, a GP may refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss the risks and options. Tests are available before, during and after pregnancy for you and your baby. These tests may include: a genetic blood test to see if you carry the altered gene a blood test during early pregnancy to check the sex of the baby – boys are more likely to be affected by some types of muscular dystrophy chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis tests during pregnancy to check if your baby has muscular dystrophy a blood test after your baby is born Information: Find out more Muscular Dystrophy UK: getting diagnosed with a muscle wasting condition How muscular dystrophy affects your life Muscular dystrophy is different for everyone. All types of muscular dystrophy can affect your ability to move around. How severe your symptoms are and how quickly they get worse depends on the type you have. Many people with muscular dystrophy will need to use mobility equipment, such as a wheelchair, as the muscle weakness gets worse. Some types of muscular dystrophy can also affect other parts of the body, such as the heart, lungs or spine. Muscular dystrophy can affect how long you live. This depends on your symptoms and how they affect you. Your care team can give you more information about this.

The most common symptom is extreme tiredness. The cause of ME/CFS is unknown. ME/CFS can affect anyone, including children. Symptoms of ME/CFS The 4 main symptoms of ME/CFS are: feeling extremely tired all the time (fatigue), which can make daily activities like taking a shower, or going to work or school, difficult sleep problems, including insomnia, sleeping too much, feeling like you have not slept properly and feeling exhausted or stiff when you wake up problems with thinking, concentration and memory (brain fog) symptoms getting worse after physical or mental activity, and possibly taking weeks to get better (also called post-exertional malaise, or PEM) Some people with ME/CFS may also have pain in different parts of the body or flu-like symptoms, such as high temperature, headache and aching joints or muscles. The symptoms of ME/CFS are similar to the symptoms of some other illnesses, so it’s important to see a GP to get a correct diagnosis. Find out more about the symptoms of ME/CFS Diagnosing ME/CFS There's no specific test for ME/CFS, so it's diagnosed based on your symptoms and by ruling out other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. The GP will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may also have blood and urine tests. As the symptoms of ME/CFS are similar to those of many common illnesses that usually get better on their own, a diagnosis of ME/CFS may be considered if you do not get better as quickly as expected. Find out more about diagnosing ME/CFS Treating ME/CFS While there's currently no cure for ME/CFS, there are treatments that may help you manage the condition and relieve the symptoms. Treatments include: energy management – where you're given advice about how to make best use of the energy you have without making your symptoms worse cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medicine to control symptoms such as pain and sleeping problems People with ME/CFS will need to adapt their daily routine and pattern of activities on a long-term basis.

    "text": "Overview - Myasthenia gravis Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Myasthenia gravis is a rare long-term condition that causes muscle weakness. It most commonly affects the muscles that control the eyes and eyelids, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing and speaking. But it can affect most parts of the body. It can affect people of any age, typically starting in women under 40 and men over 60. Symptoms of myasthenia gravis Common symptoms of myasthenia gravis include: droopy eyelids double vision difficulty making facial expressions problems chewing and difficulty swallowing slurred speech weak arms, legs or neck shortness of breath and occasionally serious breathing difficulties The symptoms tend to get worse when you're tired. Many people find they're worse towards the end of the day, and better the next morning after getting some sleep. Read more about the symptoms of myasthenia gravis . When to see a GP See a GP if you have long-lasting or worrying symptoms that could be caused by myasthenia gravis. They'll ask about your symptoms and medical history. The GP may refer you to a specialist for tests to help diagnose myasthenia gravis or look for other possible causes of your symptoms. Tests you may have include a blood test , a test to see how well your nerves are working, and some scans, such as a CT scan or MRI scan . Read more about tests for myasthenia gravis . Treatments for myasthenia gravis Treatments to help keep the symptoms of myasthenia gravis under control include: avoiding anything that triggers the symptoms – some people find that things such as tiredness and stress make their symptoms worse medicine to help improve muscle weakness surgery to remove the thymus gland (a small gland in the chest linked to myasthenia gravis) If the symptoms suddenly get worse – for example, you develop severe breathing or swallowing difficulties – you may need urgent treatment in hospital. Read more about how myasthenia gravis is treated . Outlook for myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis is a long-term condition that typically has phases when it improves and phases when it gets worse. It usually affects most of the body, spreading from the eyes and face to other areas over weeks, months or years. But for some people with myasthenia gravis only the eyes are affected. It is common for people to have \"flare-ups\", where symptoms are very troublesome, followed by periods of remission, where symptoms improve. While remission can sometimes be permanent, this is rare in cases of myasthenia gravis. If severe, myasthenia gravis can be life-threatening, but it does not have a significant impact on life expectancy for most people. Cause of myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis is caused by a problem with the signals sent between the nerves and the muscles. It's an autoimmune condition, which means it's the result of the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection) mistakenly attacking a healthy part of the body. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system damages the communication system between the nerves and muscles, making the muscles weak and easily tired. It's not clear why this happens, but it's been linked to issues with the thymus gland (a gland in the chest that's part of the immune system). Many people with myasthenia gravis have a thymus gland that's larger than normal. Around 1 in 10 people have an abnormal growth of the thymus called a thymoma. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If you have myasthenia gravis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) .

    "text": "Short-sightedness (myopia) Short-sightedness (myopia) is a very common eye condition where you cannot see objects far away clearly. It's usually corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Symptoms of short-sightedness Short-sightedness usually starts in children from age 6 to 13. It can also happen in adults. Signs you or your child may be short-sighted include: difficulty reading words from a distance, such as reading the whiteboard at school sitting close to the TV or computer, or holding a mobile phone or tablet close to the face getting headaches rubbing the eyes a lot Short-sightedness often runs in families, so you may have relatives who are also short-sighted. It can get worse until the eye has stopped growing, at around 20 years of age. Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you or your child has signs of short-sightedness you or your child has not had an eye test for 2 years What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child is short-sighted, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You'll be asked to look at a light or read letters on a chart while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given special eyedrops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly. If you or your child needs glasses, you'll be given a prescription. You can take this to any optician. Find out more about eye tests for children Information: NHS eye tests NHS eye tests are free for some people, including: children aged under 18, or under 19 and in full-time education if you've been diagnosed with diabetes or glaucoma if you're on some benefits, including Income Support and Universal Credit Find out more about free NHS eye tests Treatments for short-sightedness Short-sightedness can usually be treated with glasses or contact lenses. These help your eyes focus correctly, so you can see distant objects more clearly. Glasses are suitable for children and adults. Contact lenses are only suitable for adults and some children An optician will advise you about the best option for your short-sightedness. Help with costs of glasses and contact lenses Some people are entitled to a voucher to help towards the cost of glasses or contact lenses (NHS optical voucher), including: children aged under 18, or under 19 and in full-time education if you're on some benefits, including Income Support and Universal Credit If you do not have a voucher, you'll have to pay for glasses or contact lenses. Find out more about NHS optical vouchers Laser eye surgery and lens surgery Surgery can be used to improve sight in some adults. There are 2 different types of surgery: laser surgery to reshape the front of the eye lens surgery to replace the lenses in your eyes with artificial lenses This type of surgery is not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Find out more about laser eye surgery and lens surgery How to stop short-sightedness getting worse It's not clear why short-sightedness happens and it's hard to prevent it. But there are some things that can help stop it getting worse. These include: spending more time outdoors (especially children) wearing bi-focal or multi-focal contact lenses An optometrist may talk to you about specially designed glasses or contact lenses for your child, which may help slow down the development of myopia. This is called myopia management or myopia control. But it's not available on the NHS as more research is needed. Find out more about myopia in children on The College of Optometrists website . Some opticians may advise wearing a special lens overnight (orthokeratology). This can help you see better without glasses or contact lenses. If you're worried about your or your child's eyesight getting worse, talk to an optician. Complications of short-sightedness Young children with untreated short-sightedness are more likely to get other conditions, such as: a squint – where the eyes point in different directions a lazy eye – where sight in 1 eye does not develop properly Some adults with severe short sight-sightedness are more likely to develop: glaucoma – increased pressure inside the eyes detached retina – where the thin layer at the back of your eye (retina) becomes loose; this needs urgent treatment to prevent losing your sight cataracts – cloudy patches inside the lens of the eye Page last reviewed: 10 May 2022 Next review due: 10 May 2025"

Symptoms of nail patella syndrome Almost everyone with nail patella syndrome has abnormal nails, and many people also have problems with their knee caps (patellae), elbows and pelvis. Some of the problems will be obvious from birth, but others may not become apparent until later on. There are several symptoms and problems associated with nail patella syndrome. Nails Nails may be missing, underdeveloped, discoloured, split, ridged or pitted. Thumbnails are most severely affected, with each fingernail being less severely affected from the index finger to the little finger. Toenails are usually less affected by the condition. Kneecaps The kneecaps may be missing, small, irregularly shaped and easily dislocated, and can click, lock or may feel unstable or painful. Arms and elbows Some people aren't able to fully extend their arms or turn their palms up while keeping their elbows straight. The elbows may also angle outwards, and dislocations can occur. Pelvis Bony growths on the pelvic bone (visible on X-rays ) are common, but don't usually cause problems. Kidneys There may be protein in the urine (an early sign of kidney problems), which can be accompanied by blood in the urine . This can sometimes progress to kidney disease . Other symptoms People with nail patella syndrome may also have: increased pressure in the eyes ( glaucoma ) which can develop at an earlier age than usual numbness, tingling or a burning sensation in the hands and feet poor blood circulation in the hands and feet constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) difficulty putting on weight, particularly muscle thin bones ( osteoporosis ), particularly in the hips a high forehead and hairline Causes of nail patella syndrome Nail patella syndrome is usually caused by a fault in a gene called LMX1B that's inherited from one parent. But there isn't always a family history of nail patella syndrome. In some cases, an LMX1B gene mutation (alteration) occurs for the first time on its own. Genetic testing Nail patella syndrome is usually diagnosed based on your or your child's symptoms. In most cases, a blood test to check for the faulty gene can confirm the diagnosis. In about 5% of people diagnosed with nail patella syndrome, a fault in the LMX1B gene can't be found. Having children If you have nail patella syndrome, there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance that any child you have will be born with the condition. If you're planning to have a baby, talk to your GP about getting a referral to a genetic counsellor. They can explain the risks and what your options are. These may include: having tests during pregnancy to see if your baby will be born with nail patella syndrome trying pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) PGD is similar to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) , but the embryos are tested to check that they don't have the faulty gene before they're implanted in the womb. Read more about PGD from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Treatments for nail patella syndrome There's no cure for nail patella syndrome, but treatments are available to help manage the symptoms. Kneecap and joint problems If your kneecaps are easily dislocated and painful, painkillers, physiotherapy , splinting and bracing may help. But the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided because they can affect the kidneys. Some people may need corrective surgery for problems with the bones and joints. This should be carried out after an MRI scan by a surgeon who understands the condition. Tests and treatment for kidney problems Urine tests should be carried out at birth to check for kidney problems. High levels of protein in the urine may need to be treated with medication. Later on, your urine and blood pressure should be tested every year. Kidney problems may occur during (or be made worse by) pregnancy in women who have nail patella syndrome. It's recommended that pregnant women with the condition have their blood pressure taken and urine tested frequently. If your kidneys aren't working properly, you may need dialysis , where a machine is used to replicate many of the kidney's functions. If you have severe kidney disease, you may need a kidney transplant. Tests and treatment for glaucoma Screening for glaucoma should start as soon as a child is able to co-operate with the examination. Treatment for glaucoma may involve using eye drops or having a procedure to reduce the pressure inside the eye. Read more about testing for glaucoma and treating glaucoma . Other tests A dental examination should be carried out at least every 6 months. An assessment of bone density is recommended for young adults to check for osteoporosis . National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If you or your child has nail patella syndrome, your clinical team may pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Page last reviewed: 07 April 2021 Next review due: 07 April 2024"

    "text": "Overview - Narcolepsy Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Narcolepsy is a rare long-term brain condition that can prevent a person from choosing when to wake or sleep. The brain is unable to regulate sleeping and waking patterns normally, which can result in: excessive daytime sleepiness – feeling very drowsy throughout the day and finding it difficult to concentrate and stay awake sleep attacks – falling asleep suddenly and without warning cataplexy – temporary loss of muscle control resulting in weakness and possible collapse, often in response to emotions such as laughter and anger sleep paralysis – a temporary inability to move or speak when waking up or falling asleep excessive dreaming and waking in the night – dreams often come as you fall asleep (hypnogogic hallucinations) or just before or during waking (hypnopompic hallucinations) Narcolepsy does not cause serious or long-term physical health problems, but it can have a significant impact on daily life and be difficult to cope with emotionally. In an attempt to avoid attacks, some people may become emotionally withdrawn and socially isolated. Find out more about the symptoms of narcolepsy . What causes narcolepsy Narcolepsy is often caused by a lack of the brain chemical hypocretin (also known as orexin), which regulates wakefulness. The lack of hypocretin is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the cells that produce it or the receptors that allow it to work. But this does not explain all cases of narcolepsy, and the exact cause of the problem is often unclear. Things that have been suggested as possible triggers of narcolepsy include: hormonal changes, which can occur during puberty or the menopause major psychological stress an infection, such as swine flu , or the medicine used to vaccinate against it (Pandemrix) Find out more about the causes of narcolepsy . Who's affected It's difficult to know exactly how many people have narcolepsy because many cases are thought to go unreported. But it's estimated to affect about 30,000 people in the UK. Men and women are thought to be affected equally by narcolepsy, although some studies have suggested the condition may be more common in men. The symptoms of narcolepsy often begin during adolescence, although it's usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40. Diagnosing narcolepsy See a GP if you think you may have narcolepsy. They may ask about your sleeping habits and any other symptoms you have. They may also carry out tests to help rule out other conditions that could be causing your excessive daytime sleepiness, such as sleep apnoea , restless legs in bed and kicking during sleep, or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) . If necessary, you'll be referred to a specialist in sleep disorders, who'll analyse your sleep patterns. This will usually involve staying overnight in a specialist sleep centre so various aspects of your sleep can be monitored. Find out more about diagnosing narcolepsy . Treating narcolepsy There's currently no cure for narcolepsy, but making changes to improve your sleeping habits and taking medicine can help minimise the impact the condition has on your daily life. Taking frequent, brief naps evenly spaced throughout the day is one of the best ways to manage excessive daytime drowsiness. This may be difficult when you're at work or school, but a GP or specialist may be able to devise a sleep schedule that will help you get into a routine of taking naps. Keeping to a strict bedtime routine can also help, so you should go to bed at the same time each night whenever possible. If your symptoms are particularly troublesome, you may be prescribed medicine that can help reduce daytime sleepiness, prevent cataplexy attacks and improve your sleep at night. These medicines are usually taken as daily tablets, capsules or drinkable solutions. Find out more about treating narcolepsy . Narcolepsy and driving If you're diagnosed with narcolepsy, it may affect your ability to drive. Stop driving immediately and inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) . You'll need to complete a medical questionnaire so your individual circumstances can be assessed. You'll usually be allowed to drive again if your narcolepsy is well controlled and you have regular reviews to assess your condition.

    "text": "Nasal and sinus cancer Nasal and sinus cancer is a rare cancer that affects the nasal cavity (the space behind your nose) and the sinuses (small air-filled cavities inside your nose, cheekbones and forehead). Nasal and sinus cancer is different from cancer of the area where the nose and throat connect. This is called nasopharyngeal cancer . Credit: Gwen Shockey/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/704091/view Symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer The most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are: a blocked nose that does not go away and usually only affects 1 side nosebleeds a decreased sense of smell mucus running from your nose – this can be bloody mucus draining into the back of your nose and throat These symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as a cold or sinusitis . At a later stage, symptoms can include: pain or numbness in the face, particularly in the upper cheek, that does not go away swollen glands in the neck partial loss of vision or double vision a bulging eye a watering eye that does not go away pain or pressure in 1 ear a persistent lump or growth on your face, nose or roof of your mouth When to see a GP See a GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms. It's very unlikely they'll be caused by nasal or sinus cancer, but it's worth getting them checked out. If a GP thinks you might need some tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, you'll usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant at a hospital. Diagnosing nasal and sinus cancer Tests you may have to help diagnose nasal and sinus cancer include: a nasal endoscopy (nasoendoscopy) – where a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera and light at the end is inserted into your nose to examine the area; this can be uncomfortable, so before the procedure you'll be asked whether you'd like anaesthetic sprayed on the back of your throat a biopsy – where a small sample of tissue is removed and examined; this may be done during an endoscopy a fine needle aspiration – where fluid and cells are taken from a lymph node using a needle to see if the cancer has spread If you're diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer, you may have a CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan or ultrasound scan to help stage and grade the cancer. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the stages and grades of different types of nasal and sinus cancer . Risk groups for nasal and sinus cancer Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer. These include: prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work – including wood dust, leather dust, cloth fibres, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde smoking – the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer human papillomavirus (HPV) – a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of nasal and sinus cancer . Treatments for nasal and sinus cancer The treatment recommended for you will depend on several factors, including the stage at which the cancer was diagnosed, how far it's spread, and your general level of health. Treatment may include: surgery to remove a tumour – this can be performed through open surgery or as keyhole surgery through the nose (endoscopic microsurgery) radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill the cancerous cells, shrink a tumour before surgery, or destroy small pieces of a tumour that may be left after surgery chemotherapy – where medicine is used to help shrink or slow down the growth of a tumour, or reduce the risk of the cancer returning after surgery If you smoke, it's important that you give up. Smoking increases your risk of cancer returning and may cause you to have more side effects from treatment. Your treatment will be organised by a head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), who'll discuss the treatment options with you. A combination of treatments will often be recommended. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the treatment of nasal and sinus cancer . Outlook for nasal and sinus cancer There are many different types of cancer that can affect the nasal cavity and sinuses. The outlook varies, depending on the specific type of nasal and sinus cancer you have, its exact location, how far it's spread before being diagnosed and treated, and your overall level of health and fitness. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the outlook for nasal and sinus cancer . Help and support Being diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer can be a shock and may be difficult to come to terms with. Everyone reacts differently. Talking about how you feel with your family and friends can be a big help. But if you're unable to talk with family or friends, other sources of help and support are available. For example, Cancer Research UK has nurses you can speak to by calling 0808 800 4040 (freephone), 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.

    "text": "Nasal polyps Nasal polyps are painless soft growths inside your nose. They're not usually serious, but they can keep growing and block your nose if not treated. Symptoms of nasal polyps Symptoms of nasal polyps include: a blocked nose a runny nose a feeling that mucus is slowly dripping down the back of your throat (postnasal drip) a reduced sense of smell or taste snoring Nasal polyps can sometimes feel like a cold . But colds tend to clear up within a few days, whereas nasal polyps will not get better unless they're treated. If your polyps block your sinuses (the air pockets around your nose) you may also have symptoms of sinusitis . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you may have nasal polyps you have difficulty breathing your symptoms are getting worse you notice changes to your sense of smell Treatment for nasal polyps A GP should be able to tell if you have nasal polyps by looking inside your nose. If you have nasal polyps, you'll usually be given steroid nose drops or a spray to shrink the polyps. Sometimes, you may be given steroid tablets, usually for up to 2 weeks, to help relieve symptoms. Make sure you follow the advice of the GP about how to use your medicine and how long to take it for. Surgery to remove polyps If there's no sign of improvement after about 12 weeks, the GP may suggest surgery to remove your polyps. Most people who have surgery see an improvement, but it's common for polyps to grow back, usually within a few years. Important You may need to keep using a steroid nasal spray after surgery to stop the polyps returning quickly. Things you can do if you have nasal polyps After seeing a GP for nasal polyps, a pharmacist can recommend: steroid nasal sprays that do not need a GP prescription salt water washes (called a saline rinse or nasal douche) to help unblock your nose How to make your own salt water wash to help unblock your nose In a bowl, mix 1 level teaspoon of salt and 1 level teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in about 1 pint of cooled boiled water. Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the cooled mixture into it. Sniff the cooled mixture up 1 nostril and let it run out. Repeat sniffing at least 3 times up each nostril or until your nose clears up. You can gargle any remaining mixture to help clear the back of the throat. Check the mixture is not too hot before sniffing. Do not swallow the salty mixture. It may make you feel sick. These salt water washes are not suitable for children. Causes of nasal polyps It's not clear what causes nasal polyps. Certain things can increase your risk of getting nasal polyps, like: asthma an intolerance or sensitivity to aspirin Nasal polyps are rare in children.

    "text": "Nasopharyngeal cancer Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the part of the throat connecting the back of the nose to the back of the mouth (the pharynx). In the UK, about 260 people are diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer each year. Nasopharyngeal cancer shouldn't be confused with other types of cancer that also affect the throat, such as laryngeal cancer and oesophageal cancer . Credit: Gwen Shockey/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/704091/view Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer It's often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage. Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include: a lump in the neck that doesn’t go away after 3 weeks hearing loss (usually only in 1 ear) tinnitus (hearing sounds that come from inside the body rather than from an outside source) a blocked or stuffy nose (usually only blocked on 1 side) nosebleeds headaches double vision numbness in the bottom part of your face swallowing problems a hoarse voice unintentional weight loss See a GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if they haven't improved after 3 weeks. It's very unlikely they'll be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, but it's best to get them checked out. Causes of nasopharyngeal cancer The exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: being of south Chinese or north African descent having a diet very high in salt-cured meats and fish coming into contact with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus that causes glandular fever having a job where you regularly come into contact with hardwood dust or a chemical called formaldehyde having a first-degree relative, such as a parent, who's had the condition The human papilloma virus (HPV) is also thought to be a risk factor for developing nasopharyngeal cancer. About 3 times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer, and the average age at diagnosis is about 50. Diagnosing nasopharyngeal cancer If you go to a GP with symptoms like those of nasopharyngeal cancer, they'll usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light. The GP will refer you to a head and neck cancer specialist (oncologist) if they think further tests are necessary. At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions. Some of the tests you may have include: a nasendoscopy – a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is put in your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; you're usually conscious but local anaesthetic can be used to numb your nose and throat imaging scans – MRI scans , CT scans or PET-CT scans can be used to look for tumours and check if the cancer has spread a panendoscopy – a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together a biopsy – where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory Once these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer. They'll also be able to \"stage\" the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it's spread. Read more about the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website How nasopharyngeal cancer is treated If you're diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you'll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together in a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case. The 2 main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are: radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells chemotherapy – where medicine is used to kill cancer cells A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is often used. Surgery isn't usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer because it's difficult for surgeons to access the affected area. If you smoke, it's important you give up. Smoking increases your risk of cancer returning and may cause more side effects from treatment. Read about how to quit smoking . Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers. Most of the time, external radiotherapy is used. A machine focuses high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment. In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used. It involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This maximises the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue. Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned. External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to 7 weeks. You won't need to stay in hospital overnight between these appointments. Video: cancer treatment - what happens during radiotherapy? In this video, an expert describes what happens and advises what questions to ask if you're referred for radiotherapy. Media last reviewed: 6 June 2024 Media review due: 6 June 2027 Sometimes, internal radiotherapy may be needed if nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment. A radioactive source is put into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. Depending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time. Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as: red and sore skin in the treatment area feeling sick changes to your sense of taste dry mouth hair loss These side effects are usually temporary, but some can be permanent. Let your care team know if you have these problems, as treatment is often available to help. Read more about what happens during radiotherapy and the side effects of radiotherapy . Chemotherapy Chemotherapy may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers. It's usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every 3 to 4 weeks spread over several months. You won't usually need to stay in hospital overnight during treatment. Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as: feeling sick diarrhoea sore mouth tiredness These side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility . You should discuss any concerns you have about the potential side effects of treatment with your care team before treatment begins. Follow-up After your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments and scans to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning. To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll become gradually less frequent over time. Outlook The outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer depends on your age, general health and how advanced the condition is when you're diagnosed. Radiotherapy can often cure very early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer. But it's sometimes diagnosed at a more advanced stage because it doesn't always cause obvious symptoms until later on. More advanced cancers are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. They're often curable if the cancer hasn't spread beyond the head and neck region. There aren't any UK survival statistics for nasopharyngeal cancer. In England, almost 75 out of every 100 people diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer will live for at least 1 year after diagnosis. About 50 people out of 100 will live for 5 years or more after being diagnosed.

    "title": "Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-herpes/",
    "text": "Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby) Neonatal herpes is a herpes infection in a young baby. The younger the baby, the more vulnerable they are to the harmful effects of infection. Herpes can be very serious for a young baby, whose immune system will not have fully developed to fight off the virus. Neonatal herpes, which is rare in the UK, is caused by the herpes simplex virus. This virus is very common and causes cold sores and genital ulcers in adults. Neonatal herpes can be prevented by following some simple advice. How does a newborn baby catch herpes? During pregnancy and labour If you had genital herpes for the first time within the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy, your newborn baby is at risk of catching herpes. There's a risk you will have passed the infection on to your baby if you had a vaginal delivery. This risk is much lower if you have had genital herpes before. After birth The herpes simplex virus can be passed to a baby through a cold sore if a person has a cold sore and kisses the baby. The herpes virus can also be spread to your baby if you have a blister caused by herpes on your breast and you feed your baby with the affected breast or expressed breast milk from the affected breast. A baby is most at risk of getting a herpes infection in the first 4 weeks after birth. You should not kiss a baby if you have a cold sore to reduce the risk of spreading infection. Cold sores and other blisters caused by the herpes virus are at their most contagious when they burst. They remain contagious until completely healed. What are the warning signs in babies? Because newborn babies have underdeveloped immune systems, they can quickly become seriously ill after catching the virus. Call a GP or contact 111 straight away if your baby: is lethargic or irritable is not feeding has a high temperature (fever) – find out how to take your baby's temperature has a rash or sores on the skin, eyes and inside the mouth These are early warning signs that your baby may be unwell. Call 999 immediately if your baby: is lacking in energy (listless) is becoming floppy and unresponsive is difficult to wake up from sleep has breathing difficulties or starts grunting breathes rapidly has a blue tongue and skin ( cyanosis ) – if they have brown or black skin this may be easier to see on their lips, tongue and gums, under their nails and around their eyes Very often the baby will not have any specific herpes symptoms, such as a rash. But they can become unwell very quickly, so you need to act fast. How is neonatal herpes treated? Neonatal herpes is usually treated with antiviral medicines given directly into the baby's vein (intravenously). This treatment may be needed for several weeks. Any related complications, such as fits (seizures), will also need to be treated. You can breastfeed your baby while they're receiving treatment, unless you have herpes sores around your nipples. If you are taking antiviral treatment too, this can be excreted in your breast milk, but is not thought to cause any harm to your baby. How serious is herpes for a baby? Sometimes neonatal herpes will only affect the baby's eyes, mouth or skin. In these cases, most babies will make a complete recovery with antiviral treatment. But the condition is much more serious if it has spread to the baby's organs. Many infants with this type of neonatal herpes will die, even after they have been treated. If widespread herpes is not treated immediately, there's a high chance the baby will die. How can neonatal herpes be prevented? If you're pregnant and have a history of genital herpes, tell your doctor or midwife. You may need to take medicine during the last month of pregnancy to prevent an outbreak of vaginal sores during labour. Delivery by caesarean section is recommended if the genital herpes has occurred for the first time in the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy. If you develop a cold sore or have any signs of a herpes infection, take these precautions: do not kiss any babies wash your hands before contact with a baby wash your hands before breastfeeding cover up any cold sores, lesions or signs of a herpes infection anywhere on your body to avoid passing on the virus Support and advice if you have been affected You may find these resources helpful: cold sores genital herpes Sands World Health Organization (WHO): herpes simplex virus Page last reviewed: 03 March 2022 Next review due: 03 March 2025"

    "title": "Nephrotic syndrome in children",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nephrotic-syndrome/",
    "text": "Nephrotic syndrome in children Nephrotic syndrome is a condition that causes the kidneys to leak large amounts of protein into the urine. This can lead to a range of problems, including swelling of body tissues and a greater chance of catching infections. Although nephrotic syndrome can affect people of any age, it's usually first diagnosed in children aged between 1 and 6 years old. It tends to be more common in those with an Asian background, although it's unclear why. The symptoms of nephrotic syndrome can usually be controlled with steroid medication . Most children with nephrotic syndrome respond well to steroids and are not at risk of kidney failure. But a small number of children have inherited (congenital) nephrotic syndrome and usually do less well. They may eventually have kidney failure and need a kidney transplant. What problems can it cause? Most children with nephrotic syndrome have times when their symptoms are under control (remission), followed by times when symptoms return (relapses). In most cases, relapses become less frequent as they get older and often stop by their late teens. Some of the main symptoms associated with nephrotic syndrome include: swelling – the low level of protein in the blood reduces the flow of water from body tissues back into the blood vessels, leading to swelling (oedema) . Swelling is usually first noticed around the eyes, then around the lower legs and the rest of the body. infections – antibodies are a specialised group of proteins in the blood that help to fight infection. When these are lost, children are much more likely to get infections. urine changes – occasionally, the high levels of protein being passed into the urine can cause it to become frothy. Some children with nephrotic syndrome may also pass less urine than usual during relapses. blood clots – important proteins that help prevent the blood clotting can be passed out in the urine of children with nephrotic syndrome. This can increase their risk of potentially serious blood clots . During a relapse, the blood also becomes more concentrated, which can lead to clotting. Causes of nephrotic syndrome Most children with nephrotic syndrome have \"minimal change disease\". This means that their kidneys appear normal or nearly normal if a tissue sample is studied under a microscope. But changes to the tissue sample can be seen if it's studied under an extremely powerful electron microscope. The cause of minimal change disease is unknown. Nephrotic syndrome can sometimes occur as a result of a kidney problem or another condition, such as: glomerulosclerosis – when the inside of the kidney becomes scarred glomerulonephritis – inflammation inside the kidney an infection – such as HIV or hepatitis lupus diabetes sickle cell anaemia in very rare cases, certain types of cancer – such as leukaemia , multiple myeloma or lymphoma These problems tend to be more common in adults with nephrotic syndrome. Diagnosing nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome can usually be diagnosed after dipping a dipstick into a urine sample. If there are large amounts of protein in a person's urine, there will be a colour change on the stick. A blood test showing a low level of a protein called albumin will confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, when the initial treatment does not work, your child may need a kidney biopsy . This is when a very small sample of kidney tissue is removed using a needle so it can be studied under a microscope. Managing nephrotic syndrome The main treatment for nephrotic syndrome is steroids, but additional treatments may also be used if a child develops significant side effects. Most children have relapses until their late teens and need to take steroids when these occur. Your child may be referred to a childhood kidney specialist (paediatric nephrologist) for tests and specialist treatment. Steroids Children diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome for the first time are normally prescribed at least a 4-week course of the steroid medicine prednisolone , followed by a smaller dose every other day for 4 more weeks. This stops protein leaking from your child's kidneys into their urine. When prednisolone is prescribed for short periods, there are usually no serious or long-lasting side effects, although some children may experience: increased appetite weight gain red cheeks mood changes Most children respond well to treatment with prednisolone, with the protein often disappearing from their urine and the swelling going down within a few weeks. This period is known as remission. Diuretics Tablets that help you pee more (diuretics) may also be given to help reduce the fluid build-up. They work by increasing the amount of urine produced. Penicillin Penicillin is an antibiotic, and may be prescribed during relapses to reduce the chances of an infection. Dietary changes You may be advised to reduce the amount of salt in your child's diet to prevent further water retention and oedema. This means avoiding processed foods and not adding salt to what you eat. Get tips on how to cut down on salt Vaccinations Children with nephrotic syndrome are advised to have the pneumococcal vaccine. Some children may also be recommended the varicella (chickenpox) vaccination between relapses. Live vaccines, such as MMR , chickenpox and BCG , should not be given while your child is taking medication to control their symptoms. Additional medication Other medications may be used alongside or in place of steroids if your child's remission cannot be maintained with steroids or they experience significant side effects. Additional medications that may be used include: levamisole cyclophosphamide ciclosporin tacrolimus mycophenolate rituximab Albumin infusions Most of the protein lost in nephrotic syndrome is a type called albumin. If your child's symptoms are severe, they may be admitted to hospital to receive albumin infusions. Albumin is slowly added to the blood over a few hours through a thin plastic tube called a cannula, which is inserted into one of the veins in their arm. Caring for your child at home If your child has been diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, you'll need to monitor their condition on a daily basis to check for signs of relapses. You'll need to use a dipstick to test your child's urine for protein the first time they urinate each day. The results of a dipstick test are recorded as either: negative – 0mg of proteinuria per decilitre of urine (mg/dL) trace – 15 to 30mg/dL 1+ – 30 to 100mg/dL 2+ – 100 to 300mg/dL 3+ – 300 to 1,000mg/dL 4+ – over 1,000mg/dL The result for each day needs to be written down in a diary for your doctor or specialist nurse to review during your outpatient appointments. You should also note down the dose of any medication they're taking and any other comments, such as whether your child's feeling unwell. If the dipstick shows 3+ or more of protein in the urine for 3 days in a row, this means your child is having a relapse. If this happens, you either need to follow the advice given about starting steroids or contact your doctor. Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your child has come into contact with someone who has chickenpox or measles and your doctor has told you that your child is not immune to these illnesses your child is unwell or has a high temperature your child has diarrhoea and is being sick Congenital nephrotic syndrome Congenital nephrotic syndrome is usually caused by an inherited faulty gene. For the condition to be passed on to a child, both parents must have a healthy copy of the gene and a faulty one. Treating congenital nephrotic syndrome If your child has congenital nephrotic syndrome, they'll need frequent albumin infusions to help them grow and develop normally. This often requires a stay in hospital. Sometimes parents can be trained to administer the treatment at home. Your child will be regularly reviewed at a clinic, where their blood pressure, growth, weight, kidney function and bone health will be monitored. It can be difficult for parents to decide which option is best, so you should talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of hospital-based and home-based treatment. Dialysis and kidney transplants In some cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove 1 or both of your child's kidneys. This will stop proteins being lost in your child's urine and reduce their risk of potentially serious problems, such as blood clots. If both kidneys do need to be removed, your child will need dialysis. Dialysis is where a machine replicates kidney function, from an early age until they can receive a kidney transplant. A person only needs 1 kidney to survive, so a living person can donate a kidney. Ideally, this should be a close relative.

    "text": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition where tumours grow on the nerves and skin. There’s currently no cure, but treatment can help manage your symptoms. Information: There's a condition with a similar name called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) . This is less common than NF1. Symptoms of NF1 The symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are often mild. But some people have symptoms that cause problems. How severe the symptoms are usually depends on where the tumours are in your body and how big they are. Many of the symptoms are there from birth or start during early childhood, but some do not appear until later. Symptoms of NF1 can include: light brown patches of skin (café-au-lait spots) – these may be harder to see on brown and black skin freckles in your armpits or around the tops of your legs lumps on or just under your skin (neurofibromas) that can be painful or itchy – these tend to appear during the teenage years or early 20s yellow-brown raised dots on the coloured part of your eye (iris) that do not usually affect vision eye problems, such as a squint , reduced vision, or a bulging eye (which can sometimes cause further symptoms like headaches or feeling and being sick) a large head and below average height learning difficulties Your symptoms and how severe they are can change over time. It’s important to tell your doctor about any new symptoms or changes to existing symptoms. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you or your child might have neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you or your child keep getting headaches, they do not go away or they're getting worse you or your child keep feeling or being sick you or your child have blurred vision or vision loss Get help from 111 online or call 111. Call 111 for a child under 5 years old. How NF1 is diagnosed If a GP thinks you or your child might have neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), they'll refer you to a specialist for tests. Tests used to help confirm NF1 include: eye tests to check vision an MRI scan to check for tumours in areas of the body, such as the brain, spine and tummy genetic tests Treatments for NF1 There’s currently no cure for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms and any complications. You'll be supported by different healthcare professionals. This may include a brain specialist (neurologist), an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) and a skin specialist (dermatologist). Children will also be under the care of a doctor who specialises in the treatment of children (paediatrician). Treatment will depend on your symptoms and may include: medicine to stop tumours growing surgery to remove tumours that are at risk of causing problems using a beam of radiation to treat small tumours or pieces of a larger tumour that are left after surgery ( radiotherapy ) If your symptoms are not causing any problems, your doctor may suggest waiting to see if any problems develop before starting treatment. How NF1 affects your life Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a lifelong condition that usually gets worse over time. It affects everyone who has it differently. You or your child should have a check-up at least once a year so the symptoms can be monitored. This means any changes can be picked up early and are more likely to be successfully treated. Children with NF1 should have their eyes checked every year (adults every 2 years). Blood pressure should be checked every year. Children with NF1 often have learning difficulties and may need extra help and support at school. As the condition gets gradually worse and can cause serious problems, it can affect life expectancy. Your care team will be able to speak to you about this if you want to know more. Information: Find out more Childhood Tumour Trust: what you need to know if your child has been diagnosed with NF1 Childhood Tumour Trust: school and education Problems related to NF1 Sometimes neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can lead to further problems or serious complications. These can include: high blood pressure bone and joint problems – some children have weak bones that can cause bowed legs or a curved spine ( scoliosis ) a tumour on the nerve to the eye (optic nerve), which can cause vision problems depression, anxiety and low self-esteem caused by large tumours or tumours on your face cancer – some tumours can become cancerous and there’s a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer and brain cancer Women with NF1 should have a breast scan (mammogram) each year from the age of 40 to check for breast cancer. NF1 and pregnancy If you have NF1 and are pregnant, you may get problems, such as narrowed arteries and high blood pressure. You may also get more tumours, or your tumours may get bigger and be itchy. Talk to your care team if you have NF1 and you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant. Causes of NF1 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by an altered gene. Sometimes the altered gene is passed on to a child by one of their parents (inherited). But sometimes a child can be born with NF1 even if their parents do not have the altered gene. If you have NF1, there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of passing the affected gene on to any children you have. Help and support for NF1 If you or your child have neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), healthcare professionals will be there to support you throughout your treatment. You may also find it helpful to get support from other people with NF1, or parents of children with NF1.

There’s currently no cure, but treatment can help manage your symptoms. Information: There's a condition with a similar name called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) . This is different to NF2 but more common. Symptoms of NF2 Most people with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) get tumours in their inner ear. These tumours grow slowly and cause symptoms such as: hearing loss ringing or buzzing in your ears ( tinnitus ) balance problems You can also get tumours on your spinal cord and on the protective layers that surround your brain (meninges). These types of tumours do not always cause symptoms, but if you do have symptoms they can include: headaches feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) fits (seizures) hearing loss blurred vision and vision loss weakness or lack of movement in your face weakness, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet ( peripheral neuropathy ) lumps or marks on your skin that are sometimes smooth and shiny The symptoms of NF2 usually appear during the late teens or early twenties. Children can sometimes have symptoms. NF2 symptoms in children Children with NF2 often have problems with their eyes, such as a squint , or difficulty seeing caused by cloudy patches in the eyes ( childhood cataracts ). Lumps or marks on the skin and difficulty lifting or moving the feet ( foot drop ) are also common symptoms of NF2 in children. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you keep getting headaches, they do not go away or they're getting worse you keep feeling or being sick you have blurred vision or vision loss Get help from 111 online or call 111. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you have a seizure (fit) for the first time you have weakness or numbness in your face or down 1 side of your body How NF2 is diagnosed If you have symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) you may be referred to hospital for some tests. Tests may include: hearing tests eye tests scans, such as a CT scan or MRI scan Depending on the results, you might need to see a specialist to have an assessment and further tests. You may see several specialists including a hearing specialist (audiologist), an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) and a gene specialist (geneticist). Genetic testing A genetic test is sometimes used to diagnose NF2. If you have a close relative, such as a parent with NF2, you might have this test. If NF2 is confirmed, the geneticist will be able to give you information about the condition and answer any questions. They’ll also be able to tell you about the chance of any children you have having NF2. Treatments for NF2 There’s currently no cure for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), but there are treatments that can help manage your symptoms. Depending on your symptoms, treatments for NF2 include: hearing aids or cochlear implants (a cochlear implant is a small device that stimulates the nerve that sends sound signals to your brain) medicine that can stop tumours growing and sometimes improve hearing surgery to remove tumours that are at risk of causing problems using a beam of radiation to treat small tumours or pieces of a larger tumour that are left after surgery ( radiotherapy ) Most people with NF2 will need surgery at some point during their life to remove tumours from their inner ear, brain or spinal cord. How NF2 affects your life Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a lifelong condition that usually gets worse over time. The size of tumours, where they grow and how quickly symptoms get worse can vary from person to person. But for many people, the condition has a significant impact on daily life. Tumours in the inner ear can eventually result in you losing your hearing. You may also have difficulty moving around and may need equipment to help, such as a wheelchair. You'll need ongoing care and support from a range of specialists, such as physiotherapists and hearing specialists. You’ll also have regular appointments and scans to check for any changes in your symptoms. NF2 can affect how long you live, but this depends on your symptoms and how they affect you.

There's no cure, but treatments can help manage the symptoms. It's also called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) or Devic's disease. Symptoms of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) Symptoms of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) vary between people, and can be mild or severe. The symptoms can include: eye pain and problems with your eyesight or your colour vision, in one or both eyes sharp, burning or shooting pain (nerve pain) in your back, neck, arms or legs weakness, numbness or paralysis in your arms or legs muscle spasms (where your muscles suddenly tighten) problems with your bladder and bowels, such as incontinence, constipation or not being able to pee sexual problems, such as not being able to get an erection or reach orgasm vomiting and hiccups You may have symptoms only affecting your eyes (called optic neuritis), or only affecting your spinal cord (called transverse myelitis). Symptoms start over a few hours or days. They usually last a few days or weeks, before gradually improving. Some people recover well with treatment, while others have longer lasting problems. It's common for symptoms to come back, known as relapses. This can happen after a few weeks, months or years. In some people, relapses lead to permanent problems such as sight loss or mobility problems.

How neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is diagnosed If a GP thinks you could have neuromyelitis optica (NMO) they'll refer you to a specialist in nerve conditions (neurologist) for tests and treatment. NMO can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms vary and are similar to other conditions, such as multiple sclerosis . You may have tests such as: blood tests an MRI scan to check your brain and spinal cord a lumbar puncture to take a sample of fluid from your spinal cord tests to check your eyes and vision Treatments for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) If you're diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) you'll need treatment to stop the inflammation in your nerves and reduce the risk of relapses. Initial treatment and treatment for relapses When your symptoms first start or if you're having a relapse, where symptoms come back, the main treatments are: high dose steroid injections plasma exchange, where some of your blood is removed, treated and then returned to your body immunoglobulins (antibodies in the blood) given through a drip into your vein Treatment to help prevent relapses You'll usually also need to take medicines long term that reduce the activity of your immune system to help prevent relapses. These may include: immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine steroid tablets, such as prednisolone biological medicines, such as rituximab Treatment for symptoms You may also be offered medicines to help with any ongoing symptoms, such as: painkillers antidepressant or anticonvulsant medicines that help with nerve pain, such as amitriptyline or gabapentin muscle relaxant or anticonvulsant medicines to treat muscle spasms, such as baclofen or carbamazepine medicines for bladder problems, such as oxybutynin medicines for bowel problems, such as laxatives To help with symptoms such as muscle weakness and mobility problems you may be offered: physiotherapy , including advice on exercises and stretching occupational therapy to help with daily activities Causes of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune condition. It happens when your immune system attacks nerves in your eyes or your spinal cord. It's not known what causes it. Sometimes it happens after a virus such as flu. NMO is not an inherited condition. But it's more common in people with other autoimmune conditions, and those with close relatives who have autoimmune conditions. It's more common in women and people of Asian or Black African origin.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn/",
    "text": "Overview - Newborn jaundice Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Kernicterus Jaundice in newborn babies is common and usually harmless. It causes yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. The medical term for jaundice in babies is neonatal jaundice. Yellowing of the skin can be more difficult to see in brown or black skin. It might be easier to see on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. Other symptoms of newborn jaundice can include: dark, yellow urine (a newborn baby's urine should be colourless) pale-coloured poo (it should be yellow or orange) The symptoms of newborn jaundice usually develop 2 days after the birth and tend to get better without treatment by the time the baby is about 2 weeks old. Find out more about the symptoms of jaundice in babies Your baby will be examined for signs of jaundice within 72 hours of being born as part of the newborn physical examination . If your baby develops signs of jaundice after this time, speak to your midwife, health visitor or a GP as soon as possible for advice. While jaundice is not usually a cause for concern, it's important to determine whether your baby needs treatment. If you're monitoring your baby's jaundice at home, it's also important to contact your midwife straight away if your baby's symptoms quickly get worse or they become very reluctant to feed. Find out more about diagnosing jaundice in babies Why does my baby have jaundice? Jaundice is caused by the build-up of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance produced when red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, are broken down. Jaundice is common in newborn babies because babies have a high number of red blood cells in their blood, which are broken down and replaced frequently. Also, a newborn baby's liver is not fully developed, so it's less effective at removing the bilirubin from the blood. By the time a baby is about 2 weeks old, their liver is more effective at processing bilirubin, so jaundice often corrects itself by this age without causing any harm. In a small number of cases, jaundice can be the sign of an underlying health condition. This is often the case if jaundice develops shortly after birth (within the first 24 hours). How common is newborn jaundice? Jaundice is one of the most common conditions that can affect newborn babies. It's estimated 6 out of every 10 babies develop jaundice, including 8 out of 10 babies born prematurely before the 37th week of pregnancy. But only around 1 in 20 babies has a blood bilirubin level high enough to need treatment. For reasons that are unclear, breastfeeding increases a baby's risk of developing jaundice, which can often persist for a month or longer. But in most cases, the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh any risks associated with jaundice. Treating newborn jaundice Treatment for newborn jaundice is not usually needed because the symptoms normally pass within 10 to 14 days, although they can occasionally last longer. Treatment is usually only recommended if tests show very high levels of bilirubin in a baby's blood. This is because there's a small risk the bilirubin could pass into the brain and cause brain damage. There are 2 main treatments that can be carried out in hospital to quickly reduce your baby's bilirubin levels. These are: phototherapy – a special type of light shines on the skin, which alters the bilirubin into a form that can be more easily broken down by the liver an exchange transfusion – where your baby's blood is removed using a thin tube (catheter) placed in their blood vessels and replaced with blood from a matching donor; most babies respond well to treatment and can leave hospital after a few days Complications If a baby with very high levels of bilirubin is not treated, there's a risk they could develop permanent brain damage. This is known as kernicterus. Kernicterus is very rare in the UK. Find out more about kernicterus in babies You can also read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance about jaundice in newborn babies under 28 days .

    "title": "Newborn respiratory distress syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-respiratory-distress-syndrome/",
    "text": "Newborn respiratory distress syndrome Newborn respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) happens when a baby's lungs are not fully developed and cannot provide enough oxygen, causing breathing difficulties. It usually affects premature babies. It's also known as infant respiratory distress syndrome, hyaline membrane disease or surfactant deficiency lung disease. Despite having a similar name, NRDS is not related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . Why it happens NRDS usually occurs when the baby's lungs have not produced enough surfactant. This substance, made up of proteins and fats, helps keep the lungs inflated and prevents them collapsing. A baby normally begins producing surfactant sometime between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy. Most babies produce enough to breathe normally by week 34. If your baby is born prematurely , they may not have enough surfactant in their lungs. Occasionally, NRDS affects babies that are not born prematurely. For example, when: the mother has diabetes the baby is underweight the baby's lungs have not developed properly Around half of all babies born between 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy develop NRDS. In recent years the number of premature babies born with NRDS has been reduced with the use of steroid injections, which can be given to mothers during premature labour . Symptoms of NRDS The symptoms of NRDS are often noticeable immediately after birth and get worse over the following few days. They can include: blue-coloured lips, fingers and toes rapid, shallow breathing flaring nostrils a grunting sound when breathing If you're not in hospital when you give birth and notice the symptoms of NRDS in your baby, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Diagnosing NRDS A number of tests can be used to diagnose NRDS and rule out other possible causes. These include: a physical examination blood tests to measure the amount of oxygen in the baby's blood and check for an infection a pulse oximetry test to measure how much oxygen is in the baby's blood using a sensor attached to their fingertip, ear or toe a chest X-ray to look for the distinctive cloudy appearance of the lungs in NRDS Treating NRDS The main aim of treatment for NRDS is to help the baby breathe. Treatment before birth If you're thought to be at risk of giving birth before week 34 of pregnancy, treatment for NRDS can begin before birth. You may have a steroid injection before your baby is delivered. A second dose is usually given 24 hours after the first. The steroids stimulate the development of the baby's lungs. It's estimated that the treatment helps prevent NRDS in a third of premature births. You may also be offered magnesium sulphate to reduce the risk of developmental problems linked to being born early. If you take magnesium sulphate for more than 5 to 7 days or several times during your pregnancy, your newborn baby may be offered extra checks. This is because prolonged use of magnesium sulphate in pregnancy has in rare cases been linked to bone problems in newborn babies. Treatment after the birth Your baby may be transferred to a ward that provides specialist care for premature babies (a neonatal unit). If the symptoms are mild, they may only need extra oxygen. It's usually given through an incubator, a small mask over their nose or face or tubes into their nose. If symptoms are more severe, your baby will be attached to a breathing machine (ventilator) to either support or take over their breathing. These treatments are often started immediately in the delivery room before transfer to the neonatal unit. Your baby may also be given a dose of artificial surfactant, usually through a breathing tube. Evidence suggests early treatment within 2 hours of delivery is more beneficial than if treatment is delayed. They'll also be given fluids and nutrition through a tube connected to a vein. Some babies with NRDS only need help with breathing for a few days. But some, usually those born extremely prematurely, may need support for weeks or even months. Premature babies often have multiple problems that keep them in hospital, but generally they're well enough to go home around their original expected delivery date. The length of time your baby needs to stay in hospital will depend on how early they were born. Complications of NRDS Most babies with NRDS can be successfully treated, although they have a high risk of developing further problems later in life. Air leaks Air can sometimes leak out of the baby's lungs and become trapped in their chest cavity. This is known as a pneumothorax. The pocket of air places extra pressure on the lungs, causing them to collapse and leading to additional breathing problems. Air leaks can be treated by inserting a tube into the chest to allow the trapped air to escape. Internal bleeding Babies with NRDS may have bleeding inside their lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) and brain (cerebral haemorrhage). Bleeding into the lungs is treated with air pressure from a ventilator to stop the bleeding and a blood transfusion . Bleeding into the brain is quite common in premature babies, but most bleeds are mild and do not cause long-term problems. Lung scarring Sometimes ventilation (begun within 24 hours of birth) or the surfactant used to treat NRDS causes scarring to the baby's lungs, which affects their development. This lung scarring is called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Symptoms of BPD include rapid, shallow breathing and shortness of breath. Babies with severe BPD usually need additional oxygen from tubes into their nose to help with their breathing. This is usually stopped after a few months, when the lungs have healed. But children with BPD may need regular medicine, such as bronchodilators, to help widen their airways and make breathing easier. Developmental disabilities If the baby's brain is damaged during NRDS, either because of bleeding or a lack of oxygen, it can lead to long-term developmental disabilities, such as learning difficulties, movement problems, impaired hearing and impaired vision . But these developmental problems are not usually severe. For example, 1 survey estimated that 3 out of 4 children with developmental problems only have a mild disability, which should not stop them leading a normal adult life.

    "text": "Night terrors and nightmares Many children have nightmares and night terrors, but most grow out of them. Some adults also can also have them. Symptoms of a night terror or nightmare Night terrors and nightmares are different and happen at different stages of sleep. During a night terror you may talk and move about but are asleep. It's rare to remember having a night terror. Nightmares are bad dreams you wake up from and can remember. Night terrors are most common in children between the ages of 3 and 8, while nightmares can affect both children and adults. Differences between night terrors and nightmares. Night terrors Nightmares Mainly affect children Affect both children and adults Scream, shout, thrash about, jump out of bed, eyes open but not awake, will not remember it Strong feelings of fear, child may wake up and be able to remember the dream Happen in the early part of the night, sometimes more than once, lasting up to 15 minutes Happen later in the night Information: If you cannot move or speak as you wake up or fall asleep, you may have sleep paralysis . This is not the same as having a night terror. Causes of night terrors and nightmares Common causes of night terrors and nightmares include: being very tired or unwell sudden noises at night or needing to pee during the night (which can affect your deep sleep) something that's frightened you (such as watching a scary film) or made you stressed, anxious or worried They can also be caused by: taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants conditions that affect sleep, such as restless legs syndrome or sleep apnoea mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) conditions that affect the brain, such as dementia Night terrors are more common in people with family members who have had night terrors or who sleepwalk. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your child has night terrors several times a night or has them most nights your child has lots of nightmares about the same thing you're having regular nightmares that are affecting your sleep and everyday life How to help a child who has night terrors or nightmares For most people, night terrors and nightmares get better on their own.

Symptoms of hyperacusis You may have hyperacusis if some everyday sounds seem much louder than they should. It can sometimes be painful. You may be affected by sounds like: jingling coins a barking dog a car engine someone chewing a vacuum cleaner Your sensitivity to noise can affect relationships, school or work and your general wellbeing. Hyperacusis can affect 1 or both ears. It can come on suddenly or develop over time. Other types of hearing sensitivity include: some sounds making you angry (misophonia) some sounds making you anxious (phonophobia) your ears having trouble adjusting between quiet and loud sounds (recruitment) Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: everyday noises feel too loud or painful Your GP may refer you to a hearing specialist for further tests and treatment. Treatment for hyperacusis If hyperacusis is caused by another condition, such as migraines or Lyme disease, treating the condition may stop your hyperacusis. If there's no clear cause, you may be offered treatment to help make you less sensitive to everyday sounds. This could be: sound therapy to get you used to everyday sounds again, and may involve wearing ear pieces that make white noise cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to change the way you think about your hyperacusis and reduce anxiety Things you can try to ease hyperacusis Do try some relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises Don’t do not wear earplugs or muffs all the time because this could make you more sensitive to noise – short-term use may help in very noisy environments do not avoid noise completely because this can mean you miss out on regular activities and make you more sensitive to noise Causes of hyperacusis The cause of hyperacusis is unclear. It can appear on its own or after hearing a sudden loud noise, such as fireworks. It can also appear alongside other conditions, like: tinnitus a head injury Ménière's disease Bell's palsy Lyme disease migraines Williams syndrome autism Children are often more sensitive to loud noises than adults. It often gets better as they get older.

    "title": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/",
    "text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. Early-stage NAFLD does not usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis , if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of serious health problems, such as diabetes , high blood pressure and kidney disease . If you already have diabetes, NAFLD increases your chance of developing heart problems. If detected and managed at an early stage, it's possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. Stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) NAFLD develops in 4 main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In a small number of cases, it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are: simple fatty liver (steatosis) – a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) – a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed fibrosis – where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally cirrhosis – the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and liver cancer It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the condition getting worse. Am I at risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)? You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you: are obese or overweight – particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an \"apple-like\" body shape) have type 2 diabetes have a condition that affects how your body uses insulin (insulin resistance), such as polycystic ovary syndrome have an underactive thyroid have high blood pressure have high cholesterol have metabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity) are over the age of 50 smoke But NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. Although it's very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) , NAFLD is not caused by drinking too much alcohol. Symptoms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) There are not usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably will not know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason. Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of NAFLD) may experience: a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs) extreme tiredness unexplained weight loss weakness If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms, such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) , itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy (oedema) . See a GP urgently or call 111 if you have any of these symptoms and have a liver condition. How non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is diagnosed NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis , are ruled out. But blood tests do not always pick up NAFLD. The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body. If you're diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a biopsy , where a small sample of liver tissue is taken using a needle so it can be analysed in a laboratory. Children and young people with an increased risk of NAFLD (those with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome) should have an ultrasound scan of their liver every 3 years. Other tests you may have include a CT scan or MRI scan. Treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Most people with NAFLD will not develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse. There's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help. Treatment also may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications. You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems. Medicines There's not currently any medicine that can treat NAFLD, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition. For example, your doctor may recommend medicine to treat high blood pressure , treat high cholesterol , treat type 2 diabetes and treat obesity . Liver transplant If you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant. Or it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. As the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow to a normal size. Things you can do if you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD. For example, it can help to: lose weight – you should aim for a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 (use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI); losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it eat a healthy diet – try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt; eating smaller portions of food can help, too have water instead of sweet drinks exercise regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity , such as walking or cycling, a week; all types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you do not lose weight stop smoking – if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes NAFLD is not caused by alcohol, but drinking may make it worse. It's therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Page last reviewed: 13 January 2022 Next review due: 13 January 2025"

It can be treated with medicines from a pharmacist or GP. Symptoms of non-allergic rhinitis The most common symptoms of non-allergic rhinitis are: a blocked or runny nose sneezing an itchy nose a reduced sense of smell Sometimes non-allergic rhinitis can also cause a crust to form inside the nose. This may have a bad smell and bleed if you try to remove it. Causes of non-allergic rhinitis Common causes of non-allergic rhinitis include: having a cold changes in the weather, such as temperature or humidity exercising smoke, perfume and paint fumes alcohol and spicy food hormone changes in pregnancy or puberty, or from taking medicines such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the contraceptive pill conditions such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) medicines such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers , aspirin and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen using decongestant nasal sprays too often Information: Non-allergic rhinitis is different from allergic rhinitis , which is caused by allergies such as hay fever. Things you can do if you have non-allergic rhinitis Non-allergic rhinitis is not harmful, but it can affect your life. You can often treat it without seeing a GP. Try to avoid the things that trigger your symptoms, if you can. A pharmacist can advise you about medicines that can help, such as: antihistamines nasal sprays to unblock your nose salt water nasal sprays or solutions to rinse out the inside of your nose You can buy nasal sprays without a prescription, but they should not be used for more than a week. Using them for longer than this can make the problem worse. Find a pharmacy How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution Boil a pint of water, then leave it to cool. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water. Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it. Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat. Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day (making a new solution each time) until your nose feels more comfortable. If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.

    "text": "Non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours A brain tumour is where cells in the brain grow in an uncontrolled way. Non-cancerous tumours (also called low-grade or benign tumours) usually grow slowly and are less likely to spread than cancerous tumours. Information: There is separate information about cancerous (malignant) brain tumours . Symptoms of a brain tumour The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on which part of the brain is affected. As non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly, the symptoms usually come on gradually and may get worse slowly over months or years. Symptoms of a brain tumour can include: headaches that get worse over time or do not go away – although it's unusual for a headache to be the only symptom seizures (fits) feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) feeling sleepy or dizzy changes in your eyesight, such as blurred or double vision changes in behaviour or personality, such as confusion or problems with memory and concentration problems with speech, movement and balance Brain tumours can affect people of any age. They're more common in older adults, but some types can affect young adults or children. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you keep getting headaches, they do not go away or they're getting worse you have headaches that wake you up at night or are worse in the morning you have any other symptoms of a brain tumour that do not go away Get help from 111 online or call 111. Call 111 for a child under 5 years old. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you have a headache that came on suddenly and is extremely painful someone has a seizure (fit) for the first time Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. What happens at your GP appointment If you have symptoms of a brain tumour or another problem affecting the brain, a GP may do some simple tests to check things like your eyesight, balance and memory. If there are signs of a possible problem, they may refer you for a brain scan or to a brain specialist (neurologist) for more tests. Being referred for tests does not mean anything is seriously wrong. Tests to check for a brain tumour The main test to check for a tumour is a brain scan (usually an MRI scan ). This can show if you have a possible tumour, but you'll usually need more tests to confirm it. Most people have a procedure to remove a small sample of cells for testing. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy can show what type of tumour you have and how fast it's likely to grow (called the \"grade\"). Brain tumours are given a grade from 1 to 4. Grades 1 and 2 are generally considered to be non-cancerous (low-grade or benign) because they grow more slowly. Important: Driving You must tell the DVLA if you have a brain tumour. You may not be allowed to drive until after the tumour has been treated. This depends on the type of tumour you have, where it is in the brain and what symptoms you have. Find out how to tell the DVLA you have a brain tumour on GOV.UK Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: getting diagnosed with a brain tumour Cancer Research UK: brain tumours and driving Types of non-cancerous brain tumour There are many different types of non-cancerous brain tumour. Each type affects a different part of the brain. Some types of brain tumour can be either non-cancerous or cancerous. Some types are only non-cancerous. Common types of non-cancerous brain tumour Type Area affected Meningioma The thin layer of tissue covering the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Glioma The cells that support and protect the nerve cells in the brain (this type of tumour can sometimes be cancerous) Acoustic neuroma The nerve connecting the brain to the inner ear Pituitary adenoma A pea-sized gland in the brain that produces hormones (pituitary gland) Information: Find out more The Brain Tumour Charity: adult brain tumour types The Brain Tumour Charity: child brain tumour types Treatment for non-cancerous brain tumours Non-cancerous brain tumours are usually treatable. Your treatment depends on the type of tumour it is, where it is in your brain and any symptoms you have. You may not need treatment straight away because non-cancerous tumours tend to grow slowly. You might just have regular check-ups and scans to monitor it. If treatment is needed, the main treatment is surgery to remove the tumour. This usually involves cutting out a small piece of skull so the surgeon can remove the tumour. The piece is then fixed back in place and the cut in your skin is closed with stitches. Some people may need other treatments, such as: radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill the tumour cells) chemotherapy (where medicines are used to kill the tumour cells) treatment for any symptoms caused by the tumour (for example, medicines for nausea, seizures or pain) Information: Find out more Cancer Research UK: treatment for brain tumours The Brain Tumour Charity: neurosurgery for brain tumours Recovering from a non-cancerous brain tumour Most non-cancerous brain tumours can be successfully treated, but it can take a while to recover from the effects of a tumour and any treatment you had. Side effects of a brain tumour, or treatment for a brain tumour, may include: extreme tiredness (fatigue) problems with your concentration or memory problems with your speech, vision or movement changes to your mood or personality For some people, side effects may start months or years after treatment finishes. You may need treatment and support to help you recover, such as: exercises and help with movement from a physiotherapist help with speech and communication problems from a speech and language therapist changes to your home and advice about making everyday tasks easier from an occupational therapist help with your mental health from a counsellor or psychologist There's also a small chance a tumour could come back or could become cancerous, so you'll have regular check-ups and scans for at least a few years after treatment.

    "text": "Urethritis Urethritis is when the tube that carries pee from the bladder out of the body (urethra) becomes swollen and sore. It's often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It's important to get it treated to avoid it spreading to other people. Gonococcal urethritis is when the infection is caused by gonorrhoea. Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) or non-specific urethritis is more common. This is when the infection is caused by something other than gonorrhoea, such as chlamydia. Symptoms of urethritis Symptoms of urethritis include: pain or a burning feeling when you pee white or cloudy discharge from the vagina or penis an irritated or sore tip of the penis If urethritis is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), it can take a few days or weeks for symptoms to appear after having sex. Urethritis does not always have symptoms. If you have sex without a condom, a person with urethritis and no symptoms can pass on the infection without realising it. Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if: you think you might have urethritis or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) It's important to get it treated to avoid it spreading to other people. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at your appointment If you have symptoms of urethritis, you may have: a swab test – a cotton bud takes a sample from the urethra (this can feel uncomfortable for a few seconds) a urine test – you'll be asked not to pee for at least 2 hours before giving a urine sample as this can help make the results more reliable You may also be offered tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Healthcare professionals at the clinic or GP surgery will tell you when you'll get your test results. If the test shows that you have urethritis, anyone you've had sex with recently should be contacted and asked to get tested and treated if needed. The sexual health clinic can advise you about this. Find out more about visiting a sexual health clinic . Treatment for urethritis Urethritis is usually treated with antibiotics. It may take a week or two for your symptoms to disappear completely. Any current sexual partners may also need treatment. Avoid having sex (including oral sex) until you and any sexual partners have finished treatment and the symptoms have gone. You may be asked to come back for another appointment in 1 to 2 weeks to check the treatment has worked. Causes of urethritis Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia. You can get it if you have unprotected sex (without a condom) with someone who has the infection. Rarely, it can be caused by damaging the urethra (for example, from a urinary catheter). Sometimes no cause for the urethritis can be found. How to avoid getting urethritis You can reduce your chances of getting urethritis by: using a condom every time you have vaginal sex or anal sex using a condom to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina if you have oral sex not sharing sex toys, or washing them and covering them with a new condom before anyone else uses them You can get tested for urethritis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) even if you do not have symptoms. This can help you avoid passing on infections without realising it. Complications of urethritis Although complications are rare, sometimes urethritis can cause further problems such as: reactive arthritis – where the immune system attacks the joints or eyes, which can cause joint pain and conjunctivitis epididymitis – where the infection spreads to the testicles pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – where the infection spreads to the womb or fallopian tubes (if untreated this can cause infertility) Page last reviewed: 10 May 2023 Next review due: 10 May 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Find out more about the symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma Who's affected In the UK, more than 13,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with just over a third of cases diagnosed in people over 75. Slightly more men than women are affected. What causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma? The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. But your risk of developing the condition is increased if: you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system you take immunosuppressant medicine you have previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever You also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition. How non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed The only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy . This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory. Find out more about diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma Treatments for non-Hodgkin lymphoma There are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into 1 of 2 broad categories: high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer grows quickly and aggressively low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer grows slowly and you may not experience any symptoms for many years The outlook and treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type, grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person's age. Low-grade tumours do not necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured. The main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are: chemotherapy radiotherapy a targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy Overall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable. You can read more detailed information about the outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the Cancer Research UK website . But there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.

    "text": "Overview - Noonan syndrome Contents Overview Characteristics Causes Diagnosis Treatment Noonan syndrome is a genetic condition that can cause a wide range of distinctive features and health problems. The condition is present from before birth, although milder cases may not be diagnosed until a child gets older. The most common features of Noonan syndrome are: unusual facial features, such as a broad forehead, drooping eyelids and a wider-than-usual distance between the eyes short stature ( restricted growth ) heart defects ( congenital heart disease ) It's estimated that between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 2,500 children are born with Noonan syndrome. It affects both sexes and all ethnic groups equally. Read more about the characteristics of Noonan syndrome and diagnosing Noonan syndrome . What causes Noonan syndrome? Noonan syndrome is caused by a fault in one of several genes. At least 8 different faulty genes have been linked to the condition so far. In some cases, the faulty gene associated with Noonan syndrome is inherited from one of the child's parents. The parent with the faulty gene may or may not have obvious features of the condition themselves. Only one parent needs to carry the fault to pass it on and each child they have has a 50% chance of being born with the condition. In other cases, the condition is caused by a new genetic fault that isn't inherited from either parent. In these cases, the chance of the parents having another child with Noonan syndrome is very small. Read more about the causes of Noonan syndrome . Treatments for Noonan syndrome There's currently no single treatment for Noonan syndrome, but it's often possible to successfully manage many aspects of the condition. For example, severe heart defects may need to be repaired with surgery, and growth hormone medicine may be used to help prevent restricted growth. Your child may need quite a lot of treatment and support to help manage the various problems they have. However, they'll usually need much less care as they get older, because the condition tends to cause fewer problems in adulthood. Read more about treating Noonan syndrome . Outlook Noonan syndrome can range from being very mild to severe and life-threatening. In many cases, the problems associated with the condition can be successfully treated at a young age or become less prominent over time. Almost all children with Noonan syndrome reach adulthood and most are able to lead normal, independent lives. However, problems such as heart defects can occasionally be severe and life-threatening. Some children may need emergency surgery to correct the problem as soon as possible, and most people with Noonan syndrome will need to have their heart monitored regularly throughout their life. Noonan Syndrome Association If you or your child has been diagnosed with Noonan syndrome, you may find the Noonan Syndrome Association a useful source of support and advice. The charity Newlife , which helps families with disabled children, runs a free nurse helpline you can call – 0800 902 0095 – for more information. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If your child has Noonan syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) .

    "text": "Norovirus (vomiting bug) Norovirus, also called the winter vomiting bug, is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea. It can be very unpleasant, but usually gets better in about 2 days. Symptoms of norovirus The main symptoms of norovirus usually start suddenly and may include: feeling sick being sick (vomiting) diarrhoea You may also have: a high temperature a headache tummy pain body aches and pains Although it's sometimes called the winter vomiting bug, you can get norovirus at any time of year. How to treat norovirus yourself If you or your child have norovirus, you can usually treat it at home. You'll usually start to feel better in 2 to 3 days. A pharmacist can help with norovirus Speak to a pharmacist if you or your child (aged 5 years or over) have norovirus and: you have signs of dehydration , such as dark, smelly pee or peeing less than usual you're an older person, have a weakened immune system, or have other health conditions that increase your risk of dehydration you need to stop diarrhoea for a few hours They may recommend oral rehydration powder that you mix with water to make a drink. Find a pharmacy How norovirus is spread Norovirus is caused by a virus that spreads through poo. It can spread to others very easily. You can catch norovirus from: close contact with someone with norovirus touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them, then touching your mouth eating food that's been prepared or handled by someone with norovirus drinking unclean water or infected food How to stop norovirus spreading There are things you can do when you have norovirus to help prevent infecting others. Do wash your hands with soap and water after going to the toilet or changing nappies (alcohol hand gels do not kill norovirus) wash your hands with soap and water before preparing, serving or eating food wash clothes and bedding that has poo or vomit on it on a 60°C wash and separately from other laundry clean toilet seats, flush handles, taps and bathroom door handles avoid contact with others as much as possible Don’t do not go to school, nursery or work until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for 2 days do not visit others in hospitals or places like care homes until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for 2 days Page last reviewed: 31 December 2024 Next review due: 31 December 2027"

    "text": "Nasal and sinus cancer Nasal and sinus cancer is a rare cancer that affects the nasal cavity (the space behind your nose) and the sinuses (small air-filled cavities inside your nose, cheekbones and forehead). Nasal and sinus cancer is different from cancer of the area where the nose and throat connect. This is called nasopharyngeal cancer . Credit: Gwen Shockey/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/704091/view Symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer The most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are: a blocked nose that does not go away and usually only affects 1 side nosebleeds a decreased sense of smell mucus running from your nose – this can be bloody mucus draining into the back of your nose and throat These symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as a cold or sinusitis . At a later stage, symptoms can include: pain or numbness in the face, particularly in the upper cheek, that does not go away swollen glands in the neck partial loss of vision or double vision a bulging eye a watering eye that does not go away pain or pressure in 1 ear a persistent lump or growth on your face, nose or roof of your mouth When to see a GP See a GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms. It's very unlikely they'll be caused by nasal or sinus cancer, but it's worth getting them checked out. If a GP thinks you might need some tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, you'll usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant at a hospital. Diagnosing nasal and sinus cancer Tests you may have to help diagnose nasal and sinus cancer include: a nasal endoscopy (nasoendoscopy) – where a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera and light at the end is inserted into your nose to examine the area; this can be uncomfortable, so before the procedure you'll be asked whether you'd like anaesthetic sprayed on the back of your throat a biopsy – where a small sample of tissue is removed and examined; this may be done during an endoscopy a fine needle aspiration – where fluid and cells are taken from a lymph node using a needle to see if the cancer has spread If you're diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer, you may have a CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan or ultrasound scan to help stage and grade the cancer. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the stages and grades of different types of nasal and sinus cancer . Risk groups for nasal and sinus cancer Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer. These include: prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work – including wood dust, leather dust, cloth fibres, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde smoking – the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer human papillomavirus (HPV) – a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of nasal and sinus cancer . Treatments for nasal and sinus cancer The treatment recommended for you will depend on several factors, including the stage at which the cancer was diagnosed, how far it's spread, and your general level of health. Treatment may include: surgery to remove a tumour – this can be performed through open surgery or as keyhole surgery through the nose (endoscopic microsurgery) radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill the cancerous cells, shrink a tumour before surgery, or destroy small pieces of a tumour that may be left after surgery chemotherapy – where medicine is used to help shrink or slow down the growth of a tumour, or reduce the risk of the cancer returning after surgery If you smoke, it's important that you give up. Smoking increases your risk of cancer returning and may cause you to have more side effects from treatment. Your treatment will be organised by a head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), who'll discuss the treatment options with you. A combination of treatments will often be recommended. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the treatment of nasal and sinus cancer . Outlook for nasal and sinus cancer There are many different types of cancer that can affect the nasal cavity and sinuses. The outlook varies, depending on the specific type of nasal and sinus cancer you have, its exact location, how far it's spread before being diagnosed and treated, and your overall level of health and fitness. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the outlook for nasal and sinus cancer . Help and support Being diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer can be a shock and may be difficult to come to terms with. Everyone reacts differently. Talking about how you feel with your family and friends can be a big help. But if you're unable to talk with family or friends, other sources of help and support are available. For example, Cancer Research UK has nurses you can speak to by calling 0808 800 4040 (freephone), 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.

    "text": "Nosebleed Nosebleeds are not usually a sign of anything serious. They're common, particularly in children, and most can be easily treated at home. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: a child under 2 years old has had a nosebleed you have regular nosebleeds you have symptoms of anaemia – such as a faster heartbeat (palpitations), shortness of breath and skin that is paler than normal for you you have a nosebleed and you're taking a medicine that helps prevent blood clots, such as warfarin you have a nosebleed and you have a condition that means your blood cannot clot properly, such as haemophilia The GP might want to test you for haemophilia or for other conditions like anaemia. Immediate action required: Go to A&E if: You have a nosebleed and: your nosebleed lasts longer than 10 to 15 minutes the bleeding seems excessive you're swallowing a large amount of blood that makes you vomit the bleeding started after a blow to your head you're feeling weak or dizzy you're having difficulty breathing Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Causes of a nosebleed The inside of the nose is easy to damage and that's when nosebleeds happen. This can be caused by: picking your nose blowing your nose too hard the inside of your nose being too dry (maybe because of a change in air temperature) Nosebleeds that need medical attention can come from deeper inside the nose and usually affect adults. They can be caused by: an injury or broken nose conditions that affect the blood vessels or how the blood clots certain medicines, like warfarin Sometimes the cause of a nosebleed is unknown. Certain people are more likely to getting nosebleeds, including: children adults over 45 years old pregnant women people with high blood pressure How to stop a nosebleed yourself If you have a nosebleed, you should: sit down and lean forward, with your head tilted forward and your mouth open pinch your nose just above your nostrils for 10 to 15 minutes breathe through your mouth Holding an icepack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) on the top of the nose may help reduce the blood flow. But the evidence to show it works is not very strong. Video: How to treat a nosebleed This video shows you how to treat a nosebleed. Media last reviewed: 1 June 2023 Media review due: 1 June 2026 Treatment for nosebleeds If you have a nosebleed and a doctor can see where the blood is coming from, they may use a stick with a chemical on it to stop the bleeding. This is pushed into the nostril to seal the area. If this is not possible, they might pack your nose with ribbon gauze or sponge, to stop the bleeding. You may need to stay in hospital for a day or two. When your nosebleed stops, a doctor may prescribe an antiseptic cream to use inside your nose. This stops crusting, or scabs forming. Check the cream's ingredients first, as it may not be suitable if you have a peanut or soya allergy. When a nosebleed stops After a nosebleed, to reduce the chance of another nosebleed, try not to do the following for 24 hours: blow your nose pick your nose drink hot drinks or alcohol do any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise pick any scabs lie down flat Page last reviewed: 05 December 2023 Next review due: 05 December 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Obesity Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment The term obese describes a person who has excess body fat. In the UK it's estimated that around 1 in every 4 adults and around 1 in every 5 children aged 10 to 11 are living with obesity. How to tell if you're living with obesity The most widely used method to check if you're a healthy weight is body mass index (BMI). Body mass index (BMI) BMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. You can use the NHS BMI healthy weight calculator to find out your BMI. For most adults, if your BMI is: below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range 18.5 to 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range 25 to 29.9 – you're in the overweight range 30 to 39.9 – you're in the obese range 40 or above – you're in the severely obese range If you have an Asian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background you'll need to use a lower BMI score to measure overweight and obesity: 23 to 27.4 – you're in the overweight range 27.5 or above – you're in the obese range BMI score has some limitations because it measures whether a person is carrying too much weight but not too much fat. For example, people who are very muscular, like professional sportspeople, can have a high BMI without much fat. But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight. Waist to height ratio Another measure of excess fat is waist to height ratio, which can be used as an additional measure in adults who have a BMI under 35. To calculate your waist to height ratio: Find the middle point between your lowest rib and your hip bone. This should be roughly level with your belly button. Wrap the tape measure around this middle point, breathing naturally and not holding your tummy in. Take your measurement and divide it by your height, measured in the same units (for example, centimetres or inches). For example, if your waist is 80cm and you are 160cm tall, you would calculate your result like this: 80 divided by 160, which equals 0.5. A waist to height ratio of 0.5 or higher means you may have increased health risks. How to measure your waist This video explains how to measure your waist so you can calculate your waist to height ratio. Media last reviewed: 10 November 2023 Media review due: 10 November 2026 Risks of living with obesity Obesity is a serious health concern that increases the risk of many other health conditions. These include: type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease some types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer stroke Living with overweight and obesity can also affect your quality of life and contribute to mental health problems, such as depression , and can also affect self-esteem. Causes of obesity Obesity is a complex issue with many causes. Obesity and overweight is caused when extra calories, particularly those from foods high in fat and sugar, are stored in the body as fat. Obesity is an increasingly common problem because the environment we live in makes it difficult for many people to eat healthily and do enough physical activity. Genetics can also be a cause of obesity for some people. Your genes can affect how your body uses food and stores fat. There are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) , although these types of conditions do not usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medicines. Some medicines can also make people more likely to put on weight, including steroids and some medicines for high blood pressure, diabetes or mental health conditions. Treating obesity The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. To do this, you can: eat a balanced calorie-controlled diet as recommended by a GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian) take up activities such as fast walking , jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (2.5 to 5 hours) a week You may benefit from joining a local weight management programme with group meetings or online support. Your GP can tell you about these. You may also benefit from receiving support and counselling from a trained healthcare professional to help you better understand your relationship with food and develop different eating habits. If you're living with obesity and lifestyle and behavioural changes alone do not help you lose weight, a medicine called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medicine works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you. A specialist may prescribe other medicines called liraglutide, semaglutide or tirzepatide. They work by making you feel fuller and less hungry. For some people living with obesity, a specialist may recommend weight loss surgery . Other obesity-related problems Living with obesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions. Day-to-day problems related to obesity include: breathlessness increased sweating snoring difficulty doing physical activity often feeling very tired joint and back pain low confidence and self-esteem feeling isolated The psychological problems associated with living with obesity can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression . Serious health conditions Living with obesity can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, including: type 2 diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and stroke asthma metabolic syndrome , a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity several types of cancer, including bowel cancer , breast cancer and womb cancer gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) , where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the gullet gallstones reduced fertility osteoarthritis , a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints sleep apnoea , a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease liver disease and kidney disease pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia , when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy Obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on how severe it is. Outlook Managing a complex issue like obesity can be hard. Losing weight takes time and commitment. The healthcare professionals involved with your care can provide encouragement and advice about how to mange your weight, build healthy lifestyle habits and maintain weight loss achieved. Completing a weight management programme, regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals, and involving your friends and family with ways to lose weight can also help. It's important to remember that losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.

    "text": "Sleep apnoea Sleep apnoea is when your breathing stops and starts while you sleep. The most common type is called obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Sleep apnoea needs to be treated because it can lead to more serious problems. Symptoms of sleep apnoea Symptoms of sleep apnoea mainly happen while you sleep. They include: breathing stopping and starting making gasping, snorting or choking noises waking up a lot loud snoring During the day, you may also: feel very tired find it hard to concentrate have mood swings have a headache when you wake up Information: It can be hard to tell if you have sleep apnoea. It may help to ask someone to stay with you while you sleep so they can check for the symptoms. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have any of the main symptoms of sleep apnoea, such as: your breathing stops and starts while you sleep you make gasping, snorting or choking noises while you sleep you always feel very tired during the day If someone else has seen you have the symptoms, it can help to bring them with you to the GP. Sleep apnoea can be serious if it's not diagnosed and treated. Getting tested for sleep apnoea If a GP thinks you might have sleep apnoea, they may refer you to a specialist sleep clinic for tests. At the clinic, you may be given devices that check things like your breathing and heartbeat while you sleep. You'll be asked to wear these overnight so doctors can check for signs of sleep apnoea. You can usually do this at home, but sometimes you may need to stay in the clinic overnight. The test can show if you have sleep apnoea and how severe it is. This is based on how often your breathing stops while you sleep (AHI score). Understanding your AHI score Your AHI score shows how severe your sleep apnoea is: AHI of 5 to 14 = mild AHI of 15 to 30 = moderate AHI over 30 = severe Treatments for sleep apnoea Sleep apnoea can sometimes be treated by making lifestyle changes like losing weight, giving up smoking and reducing how much alcohol you drink. But many people need to use a device called a CPAP machine. You'll be given this for free on the NHS if you need it. CPAP machine A CPAP machine gently pumps air into a mask you wear over your mouth or nose while you sleep. It can help: improve your breathing while you sleep by stopping your airways getting too narrow improve the quality of your sleep and help you feel less tired reduce the risk of problems linked to sleep apnoea, such as high blood pressure Using a CPAP machine may feel strange or awkward at first, but try to keep using it. It works best if you use it every night. Tell your doctor if you find it uncomfortable or hard to use. Other treatments Other treatments sometimes used for sleep apnoea include: a gum shield-like device that holds your airways open while you sleep (mandibular advancement device) surgery to help your breathing, such as removing large tonsils Information: Find out more Asthma + Lung UK: CPAP machines Asthma + Lung UK: treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea Things you can do to help with sleep apnoea If you've been diagnosed with sleep apnoea, there are some things you can do to help.

Do try to lose weight if you're overweight exercise regularly – being active can improve your symptoms and help you keep to a healthy weight have good sleep habits like making sure your bedroom is dark and quiet, and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day sleep on your side – try taping a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear, or buy a special pillow or bed wedge to help keep you on your side Don’t do not smoke do not drink too much alcohol – especially shortly before going to sleep do not take sleeping pills unless recommended by a doctor – they can make sleep apnoea worse Sleep apnoea can cause other problems Without treatment, sleep apnoea can lead to other problems including: high blood pressure a higher chance of having a stroke type 2 diabetes heart disease depression or mood changes a higher chance of having a serious accident caused by tiredness, such as a car accident difficulty concentrating at work or school Sleep apnoea can also be difficult for your partner and put a strain on your relationship with them. Important: Driving and sleep apnoea You may need to tell the DVLA about your sleep apnoea. If sleep apnoea has been confirmed, you must not drive until symptoms like feeling very tired are under control. Check the rules for driving if you have sleep apnoea on GOV.UK Causes of sleep apnoea Sleep apnoea happens if your airways become too narrow while you sleep. This stops you breathing properly.

The upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach. It usually ends in a pouch, which means food can't reach the stomach. It often happens along with another birth defect called a tracheo-oesophageal fistula, which is a connection between the lower part of the oesophagus and the windpipe (trachea).

These defects mean the baby won't be able to swallow safely, if at all. They could also develop life-threatening problems such as choking and pneumonia if not treated quickly, so surgery will usually be carried out within a few days of birth. Causes of oesophageal atresia Oesophageal atresia is thought to be caused by a problem with the development of the oesophagus while the baby is in the womb, although it's not clear exactly why this happens. It's more common in babies who have problems with the development of their kidneys, heart and spine. The risk of having another baby with oesophageal atresia is thought to be very small. Diagnosing oesophageal atresia Doctors may suspect your baby has oesophageal atresia before they're born if routine ultrasound scans show a lot of amniotic fluid in the womb. This is because babies with oesophageal atresia cannot swallow the fluid as they would usually, leading to a build-up of fluid in the womb. Although fluid build-up can have a number of other causes. Tests to check for the condition will be carried out after your baby is born, if they seem to be having problems swallowing or breathing. A thin feeding tube may be passed down your baby's throat through their nose, to see if it reaches their stomach. And an X-ray may then be carried out to check the oesophagus. Repairing the defects An operation to repair an oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula is usually done soon after birth. Your baby will be taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, where they're given a general anaesthetic . They'll receive nutrition into a vein (intravenously) and a suction tube will be used to remove fluid from the pouch in their oesophagus. The surgeon makes a cut on the right side of the chest, between the ribs, and closes off the abnormal connection (fistula) between the oesophagus and windpipe. They'll then sew together the upper and lower parts of the oesophagus. If the gap in the oesophagus is large, your child may need to wait a few months for the operation, to allow their oesophagus to grow a bit more. A similar wait may be recommended if they have an oesophageal atresia but they don’t have a tracheo-oesophageal fistula. During this time, they'll need to have a feeding tube temporarily placed into their stomach through their tummy. Occasionally, a procedure to lengthen the oesophagus before repairing it may be carried out. After surgery After surgery, your child will be kept in the intensive care unit and placed in an incubator. They may also need: antibiotics a machine to help them breathe (ventilator) a tube into their chest to drain fluids or air that might be trapped oxygen pain medicine Your baby will be given nutrition intravenously at first, but you should be able to feed them after a few days using a feeding tube passed into their stomach through their nose. Going home You'll be able to take your baby home once they're taking food by mouth. This will usually take a week or two. You'll be advised about how to feed your child when they get home and as they get older. Breast or bottle feeding will usually be recommended for at least the first 6 months. It may then be possible to very gradually wean your child on to thicker foods. The hospital may be able to refer you to a dietitian for specific advice. Contact the hospital or your GP if your child is choking or coughing on their feeds, has any difficulty swallowing or is failing to gain weight. Risks of surgery With any surgery, there's a small risk of bleeding and infection. For this particular operation, the additional risks are: food or air leaking from the area being repaired narrowing of the repaired oesophagus reopening of the fistula between the oesophagus and windpipe A further procedure or operation may be needed to treat these problems if they develop. Outlook Most children who have surgery will go on to have normal lives. But there's a chance your child may experience some further problems, including: swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – where acid leaks out of the stomach and up into the oesophagus asthma -like symptoms – such as persistent coughing or wheezing recurrent chest infections tracheomalacia – where the repaired section of windpipe becomes floppy and makes breathing difficult Your child will be continuously monitored by specialists after their operation to pick up problems such as these and treat them early on. Some of these problems will improve as your child gets older. Help and support Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula Support (TOFS) is a charity that supports people born with oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula and their families. As well as visiting the TOFS website, you can call their helpline on 0115 961 3092.

How you get orf Orf is a virus that mainly affects young lambs and goats. You can get it if you have a sore, cut or scratch that touches an infected animal. You're most at risk if you have regular contact with sheep or goats – for example, if you're a farmer or if you bottle feed a lamb. Orf causes scabs around the animal's nose and mouth, which may spread to their legs and teats. It's not usually serious but is passed easily between animals. Sheep and goats can be vaccinated against the orf virus. But people can get infected if they come into contact with recently vaccinated or unvaccinated animals. It's very rare for orf to be passed from one person to another. Symptoms of orf Orf usually affects the skin on your fingers, hands, forearms or face. To start with, the affected area of skin is small and may look a reddish-blue colour. It may be itchy or tender.

    "text": "Overview - Osteoarthritis Contents Overview Symptoms Treatment and support Living with Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes joints to become painful and stiff. It's the most common type of arthritis in the UK. Symptoms of osteoarthritis The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are joint pain and stiffness, and problems moving the joint. Some people also have symptoms such as: swelling tenderness grating or crackling sound when moving the affected joints The severity of osteoarthritis symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and between different affected joints. For some people, the symptoms can be mild and may come and go. Other people can experience more continuous and severe problems which make it difficult to carry out everyday activities. Almost any joint can be affected by osteoarthritis, but the condition most often causes problems in the knees, hips and small joints of the hands. You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can confirm the diagnosis and prescribe any necessary treatment. Read more about the symptoms of osteoarthritis . Causes of osteoarthritis As part of normal life, your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases, your body repairs the damage itself and you do not experience any symptoms. But in osteoarthritis, the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones breaks down, causing pain, swelling and problems moving the joint. Bony growths can develop, and the area can become swollen and red. (Redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin.) The exact cause is not known, but several things are thought to increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including: joint injury – overusing your joint when it has not had enough time to heal after an injury or operation other conditions (secondary arthritis) – osteoarthritis can happen in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout age – your risk of developing the condition increases as you get older family history – osteoarthritis may run in families, although studies have not identified a single gene responsible obesity – being obese puts excess strain on your joints, particularly those that bear most of your weight, such as your knees and hips being a woman – osteoarthritis is more common in women than men Diagnosing osteoarthritis To help determine whether you have osteoarthritis, a GP will first ask you about your symptoms and examine your joints. A GP may suspect osteoarthritis if: you're aged 45 or older you have joint pain that gets worse the more you use your joints the stiffness in your joints is not there in the mornings, or lasts less than 30 minutes If your symptoms are slightly different, this may indicate another joint condition. For example, prolonged joint stiffness in the morning can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis . Further tests – such as X-rays or blood tests – are not usually necessary, but may be used to rule out other possible causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis or a fractured bone. Treating osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition and cannot be cured, but it doesn't necessarily get any worse over time and it can sometimes gradually improve. A number of treatments are also available to reduce the symptoms. Mild symptoms can sometimes be managed with simple measures, including: regular exercise losing weight if you're overweight wearing suitable footwear using special devices to reduce the strain on your joints during your everyday activities If your symptoms are more severe, you may need additional treatments such as painkillers and a structured exercise plan with a physiotherapist. In a small number of cases, where these treatments haven't helped or the damage to the joints is particularly severe, surgery may be done to repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint. Find out more about treating osteoarthritis . Living with osteoarthritis As osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, it's important you receive support to help you cope with any issues such as reduced mobility, and advice on any necessary financial support. Some people may find it helpful to talk to their GP or others who are living with osteoarthritis, as there may be questions or worries you want to share. Find out more about living with osteoarthritis . Preventing osteoarthritis It's not possible to prevent osteoarthritis altogether. However, you may be able to minimise your risk of developing the condition by avoiding injury and living a healthy lifestyle. Exercise Exercise or a job that puts frequent strain on your joints and forces them to bear an excessive load can increase your risk of osteoarthritis. Try to do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week, plus strength exercises on 2 or more days each week that work the major muscle groups, to keep yourself generally healthy. Find out more about health and fitness , including tips on simple exercises you can do at home. Posture It can also help to maintain good posture at all times and avoid staying in the same position for too long. If you work at a desk, make sure your chair is at the correct height, and take regular breaks to move around. Losing weight Being overweight or obese increases the strain on your joints and your risk of developing osteoarthritis. If you're overweight, losing weight may help lower your chances of developing the condition. Use the BMI healthy weight calculator to find out whether you're overweight or obese.

    "text": "Overview - Rickets and osteomalacia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Prevention Rickets is a condition that affects bone development in children. It causes bone pain, poor growth and soft, weak bones that can lead to bone deformities. Adults can experience a similar condition, which is known as osteomalacia or soft bones. Read more about the signs and symptoms of rickets and osteomalacia . What causes rickets? A lack of vitamin D or calcium is the most common cause of rickets. Vitamin D largely comes from exposing the skin to sunlight, but it's also found in some foods, such as oily fish and eggs. Vitamin D is essential for the formation of strong and healthy bones in children. In rare cases, children can be born with a genetic form of rickets. It can also develop if another condition affects how vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body. Read more about the causes of rickets . Who's affected? Rickets was common in the past, but it mostly disappeared in the western world during the early 20th century after foods like margarine and cereal were fortified with vitamin D. However, in recent years, there's been an increase in cases of rickets in the UK. The number of rickets cases is still relatively small, but studies have shown a significant number of people in the UK have low levels of vitamin D in their blood. Any child who doesn't get enough vitamin D or calcium either through their diet, or from sunlight, can develop rickets. But the condition is more common in children with dark skin, as this means they need more sunlight to get enough vitamin D, as well as children born prematurely or taking medication that interferes with vitamin D. Treating rickets For most children, rickets can be successfully treated by ensuring they eat foods that contain calcium and vitamin D, or by taking vitamin supplements. Some families are eligible for free vitamin supplements from the government's Healthy Start scheme – find out if you're eligible and how to apply . If your child has problems absorbing vitamins and minerals, they may need a higher supplement dose or a yearly vitamin D injection. Read more about treating rickets . Preventing rickets Rickets can easily be prevented by eating a diet that includes vitamin D and calcium, spending some time in sunlight, and if necessary, taking vitamin D supplements. Read more about: preventing rickets who should take vitamin D supplements how much vitamin D adults, children and babies need When to seek medical advice Take your child to see your GP if they have any of the signs and symptoms of rickets . Your GP will carry out a physical examination to check for any obvious problems. They may also discuss your child's medical history, diet, family history, and any medication they're taking. A blood test can usually confirm a diagnosis of rickets, although your child may also have some X-rays or possibly a bone density scan (DEXA scan) . This is a type of X-ray that measures the calcium content in bones. If you're an adult and you’re experiencing bone pain or muscle weakness you should also see your GP to get it checked out.

    "text": "Osteomyelitis Osteomyelitis is a painful bone infection. It usually goes away if treated early with antibiotics. It can cause serious long-term problems if it's not treated. Who's at risk of getting osteomyelitis Anyone can develop osteomyelitis, but you're more at risk of getting it if you have: had osteomyelitis before diabetes , especially if you also have a foot ulcer broken (fractured) a bone been injured and have a wound had an infection had surgery a weakened immune system (for example, because of chemotherapy, or you have a condition such as HIV) Children may also be more likely to get osteomyelitis after having a respiratory infection or chickenpox. Symptoms of osteomyelitis Osteomyelitis usually causes severe pain, most often affecting the legs, but it may affect other parts of the body. Other symptoms of osteomyelitis can include: swelling of the affected area a feeling of warmth on the affected area redness of the skin in the affected area, which may be harder to see on black or brown skin a limp (more common in children) a high temperature Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or contact NHS 111 if you have: pain, swelling, redness and a warm sensation over an area of bone a very high temperature (or you feel hot and shivery) and feel generally unwell had osteomyelitis before and you think the symptoms have come back Take your child to a GP if: they do not want to use an arm or leg and seem irritable - young children do not always get a high temperature with osteomyelitis You can call NHS 111 or get help from 111 online . If it's not treated quickly, osteomyelitis can cause serious long-term problems, such as infections and permanent damage to your bones. What happens at your GP appointment The GP will examine the area and may do some tests to find out if you have a bone infection. You might need a blood test, or to go to hospital for: an X-ray , CT scan or MRI scan a biopsy , where a small sample of fluid is taken from the bone and sent for testing Treatment for osteomyelitis Osteomyelitis is treated with antibiotics. You may need treatment in hospital, or you might be able to take antibiotics at home. You'll usually take antibiotics for 4 to 6 weeks. If you have a severe infection, you may need to take them for up to 12 weeks. It's important to finish a course of antibiotics even if you start to feel better. If the infection is treated quickly (within 3 to 5 days of it starting), it often clears up completely. You can take painkillers to ease the pain. If the infection is in a long bone (such as an arm or leg), you may be fitted with a splint so you do not move it as often. Surgery for osteomyelitis You'll usually need an operation if: a build-up of pus (abscess) develops in the bone and the pus needs to be drained the infection presses against something else, for example, the spinal cord the infection has lasted a long time and damaged the bone If the infection has damaged the bone, you'll need surgery (known as debridement) to remove the damaged part. Debridement can leave an empty space in the bone, which may need to be reconstructed. Sometimes more than 1 operation is needed to treat the infection. Muscle and skin from another part of the body might be used to repair the area near the affected bone. Diabetes and osteomyelitis It's very important to look after your feet if you have diabetes. If you have poorly controlled diabetes, you can lose sensation in your feet and not notice small cuts, which could develop into an infection that spreads to the bone.

    "text": "Overview - Osteoporosis Contents Overview Causes Treatment Living with Prevention Osteoporosis is a health condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a fall or sudden impact causes a bone to break (fracture). The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: broken wrist broken hip ( hip fracture ) broken spinal bones (vertebrae) However, breaks can also happen in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a broken rib or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine. Osteoporosis is not usually painful until a bone is broken, but broken bones in the spine are a common cause of long-term pain. Although a broken bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have broken, making it difficult to support the weight of the body. Osteoporosis can be treated with bone strengthening medicines. Bone loss before osteoporosis (osteopenia) The stage before osteoporosis is called osteopenia. This is when a bone density scan shows you have lower bone density than the average for your age, but not low enough to be classed as osteoporosis. Osteopenia does not always lead to osteoporosis. It depends on many factors. If you have osteopenia, there are steps you can take to keep your bones healthy and reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis . Your doctor may also prescribe one of the bone-strengthening treatments that are given to people with osteoporosis, depending on how weak your bones are and your risk of breaking a bone. Causes of osteoporosis Losing bone is a normal part of ageing, but some people lose bone much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of broken bones. Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause . Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45) or they've had their ovaries removed. However, osteoporosis can also affect men, younger women and children. Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including: taking high-dose steroid tablets for more than 3 months other medical conditions – such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems a family history of osteoporosis – particularly a hip fracture in a parent long-term use of certain medicines that can affect bone strength or hormone levels, such as anti-oestrogen tablets that many women take after breast cancer having or having had an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia having a low body mass index (BMI) not exercising regularly heavy drinking and smoking Read more about the causes of osteoporosis . Diagnosing osteoporosis and osteopenia If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can work out your future risk of breaking a bone using an online programme, such as FRAX or Q-Fracture. Find out more about Frax, the online tool developed by Sheffield University Bone density scan (DEXA scan) They may also refer you for a bone density scan to measure your bone strength. It's a short, painless procedure that takes 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned. Your bone density can be compared to that of a healthy young adult. The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score. Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of: above -1 SD is normal between -1 and -2.5 SD shows bone loss and is defined as osteopenia below -2.5 shows bone loss and is defined as osteoporosis Treating osteoporosis Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing broken bones, and taking medicine to strengthen your bones. The decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of breaking a bone in the future. This will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your bone density scan. If you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you. Read more about how osteoporosis is treated . Preventing osteoporosis If you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include: taking regular exercise to keep your bones as strong as possible healthy eating – including foods rich in calcium and vitamin D taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin D making lifestyle changes – such as giving up smoking and reducing your alcohol consumption Read more about preventing osteoporosis . Living with osteoporosis If you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular sight tests and hearing tests . To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using: painkillers hot and cold treatments, such as warm baths and cold packs relaxation techniques and other ways to reduce pain Speak to your GP or nurse if you're worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition.

Hearing aids or surgery will usually improve your hearing and total hearing loss is rare. Symptoms of otosclerosis Symptoms of otosclerosis include: gradual hearing loss in 1 or both ears, often over several years hearing ringing, buzzing or other noises in 1 or both ears ( tinnitus ) dizziness problems with your balance Otosclerosis is a common cause of hearing loss in younger adults. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 30 to 50.

Hearing aids work by making the sounds around you louder. They can help you hear easier, but they will not stop your hearing from getting worse. You may also be offered surgery to remove one of the small bones (the stapes) in your affected ear or ears. If your stapes is removed, it will be replaced by a plastic or metal implant. Surgery is usually very successful at improving hearing. You will usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT) who will help you decide which treatment may be best for you. Causes of otosclerosis Otosclerosis happens when a tiny bone inside your ear, called the stapes, joins (fuses) with other parts of the ear and stops you being able to hear properly. It's not known why otosclerosis happens, but it may be passed on in families. You are more likely to get otosclerosis if a close relative has it.

Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and go away in a few months without needing any treatment. The ovaries The ovaries are 2 almond-shaped organs that are part of the female reproductive system. There's 1 on each side of the womb (uterus). The ovaries have 2 main functions: to release an egg approximately every 28 days as part of the menstrual cycle to release the sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which play an important role in reproduction Ovarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect 1. Symptoms of an ovarian cyst An ovarian cyst usually only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large or twists and then blocks the blood supply to the ovaries. In these cases, you may have: pelvic pain – this can range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain pain during sex difficulty emptying your bowels a frequent need to urinate heavy periods , irregular periods or lighter periods than normal bloating and a swollen tummy feeling very full after only eating a little difficulty getting pregnant – although fertility is usually unaffected by ovarian cysts See a GP if you have symptoms of an ovarian cyst. Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have sudden, severe pelvic pain you have pain in your tummy (abdomen) and you also feel sick (nausea) or are being sick (vomiting) You can call 111 or get help from 111 online Types of ovarian cyst The 2 main types of ovarian cyst are: functional ovarian cysts – cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type pathological ovarian cysts – cysts that form as a result of abnormal cell growth; these are much less common Ovarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition, such as endometriosis . The vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign), although a small number are cancerous (malignant). Cancerous cysts are more common if you have been through the menopause. Find out more about the causes of ovarian cysts Diagnosing ovarian cysts If a GP thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you'll probably be referred for an ultrasound scan , carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina. If a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks, or a GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health (gynaecologist). If there's any concern that your cyst could be cancerous, the doctor will also arrange blood tests to look for high levels of chemicals that can indicate ovarian cancer . But having high levels of these chemicals does not necessarily mean you have cancer, as high levels can also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, such as: endometriosis a pelvic infection fibroids your period Treating ovarian cysts Whether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on: its size and appearance whether you have any symptoms whether you have been through the menopause In most cases, the cyst disappears after a few months. A follow-up ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this. If you are postmenopausal, there is a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer . Regular ultrasound scans and blood tests are usually recommended over the course of a year to monitor the cyst. Surgical treatment to remove the cysts may be needed if they're large, causing symptoms or potentially cancerous. Ovarian cysts and fertility Ovarian cysts do not usually prevent you getting pregnant, although they can sometimes make it harder to conceive. If you need an operation to remove your cysts, your surgeon will aim to preserve your fertility whenever possible. This may mean removing just the cyst and leaving the ovaries intact, or only removing 1 ovary. In some cases, surgery to remove both your ovaries may be necessary, in which case you'll no longer produce any eggs. Make sure you talk to your surgeon about the potential effects on your fertility before your operation.

    "text": "Overview - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications An overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis, is where the thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea). It produces hormones that affect things such as your heart rate and body temperature. Having too much of these hormones can cause unpleasant and potentially serious problems that may need treatment. An overactive thyroid can affect anyone, but it's about 10 times more common in women than men, and typically happens between 20 and 40 years of age. Symptoms of an overactive thyroid An overactive thyroid can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: nervousness, anxiety and irritability mood swings difficulty sleeping persistent tiredness and weakness sensitivity to heat swelling in your neck from an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre) an irregular and/or unusually fast heart rate (palpitations) twitching or trembling weight loss Find out more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid When to see a GP See a GP if you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid. They'll ask about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem, they can arrange for a blood test to check how well your thyroid is working. If the blood test shows that you have an overactive thyroid, you may be referred for further tests to identify the cause. Find out more about how an overactive thyroid is diagnosed Treatments for an overactive thyroid An overactive thyroid is usually treatable. The main treatments are: medicine that stops your thyroid producing too much of the thyroid hormones radioiodine treatment – where a type of radiotherapy is used to destroy cells in the thyroid, reducing its ability to produce thyroid hormones surgery to remove some or all of your thyroid, so that it no longer produces thyroid hormones Each of these treatments has benefits and drawbacks. You'll usually see a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to discuss which treatment is best for you. Find out more about how an overactive thyroid is treated Causes of an overactive thyroid There are several reasons why your thyroid can become overactive. These include: Graves' disease – an autoimmune condition where the immune system produces antibodies that cause the thyroid to produce too much thyroid hormone (about 4 in every 5 people with an overactive thyroid have Graves' disease) lumps (nodules) on the thyroid – this extra thyroid tissue can produce thyroid hormones, causing your levels to be too high some medicines such as amiodarone, which can be used to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Find out more about the causes of an overactive thyroid Further problems An overactive thyroid can sometimes lead to further problems, particularly if it's not treated or well controlled. These include: eye problems – such as eye irritation, double vision or bulging eyes pregnancy complications – such as pre-eclampsia , premature birth or miscarriage a thyroid storm – a sudden and life-threatening flare-up of symptoms Find out more about the complications of an overactive thyroid Help and support British Thyroid Foundation: help and support if you have an overactive thyroid Page last reviewed: 11 April 2023 Next review due: 11 April 2026 Next : Symptoms"

    "text": "Overview - Paget's disease of bone Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Complications Paget's disease of bone disrupts the normal cycle of bone renewal, causing bones to become weakened and possibly deformed. It's a fairly common condition in the UK, particularly in older people. It's rare in people under 50 years of age. There are treatments that can help keep it under control for many years, but it can cause persistent pain and a range of other problems in some people. Symptoms of Paget's disease of bone Paget's disease of bone can affect 1 bone or several bones. Commonly affected areas include the pelvis, spine and skull. Symptoms can include: bone or joint pain skin feeling warm over the affected bone changes in bone shape a shooting pain that travels along or across the body, numbness and tingling ( peripheral neuropathy ), or balance problems But in many cases there are no symptoms and the condition is only found during tests carried out for another reason. Read more about the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone . When to see your GP See your GP if you have: persistent bone or joint pain deformities in any of your bones symptoms of a nerve problem, such as numbness, tingling or balance problems Your GP can organise tests to check your bones and look for problems such as Paget's disease of bone. Read more about how Paget's disease of bone is diagnosed . Causes of Paget's disease of bone Bone cells regenerate in a similar way to skin – old bone is removed and replaced by new bone. This is known as bone remodelling. 2 cells are responsible for this: osteoclasts – cells that absorb old bone osteoblasts – cells that make new bone In Paget's disease of bone, something goes wrong with the osteoclast cells and they start to absorb bone at a much faster rate than usual. The osteoblasts then try to produce new bone more quickly, but the new bone is larger and weaker than normal. It's not clear what triggers this, but you're at a higher risk if you have a family history of Paget's disease of bone. You may inherit a genetic fault that means you're much more likely to develop the condition. Treatments for Paget's disease of bone There's currently no cure for Paget's disease of bone, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms. If you do not have any symptoms, your doctor may suggest keeping an eye on your condition and delaying treatment until any problems occur. The main treatments are: bisphosphonate medication – medicines that help control bone regeneration and are used to control pain supportive therapies – including physiotherapy , occupational therapy and devices such as walking sticks or shoe inserts surgery – this may be needed if further problems develop, such as fractures, deformities or severe joint damage Ensuring you get enough calcium and vitamin D can also help. Some people may need to take supplements. Read more about how Paget's disease of bone is treated . Further problems caused by Paget's disease of bone Paget's disease of bone can sometimes lead to further, potentially serious problems. These include: fragile bones that break more easily than normal osteoarthritis , which causes painful and stiff joints enlarged or misshapen bones permanent hearing loss (if the skull is affected) heart problems in rare cases, bone cancer Read more about possible complications of Paget's disease of bone . Other types of Paget's disease There are several other types of Paget's disease that are not related to Paget's disease of bone. These include: Paget's disease of the nipple or breast – a rare type of breast cancer Paget's disease of the penis – a rare type of penile cancer Paget's disease of the vulva – a rare type of vulval cancer The general term \"Paget's disease\" is sometimes used to refer to Paget's disease of bone.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pagets-disease-nipple/",
    "text": "Overview - Paget's disease of the nipple Contents Overview Diagnosis Treatment Reducing the risk Paget's disease of the nipple, also known as Paget's disease of the breast, is a rare condition associated with breast cancer . It causes eczema-like changes to the skin of the nipple and the area of darker skin surrounding the nipple (areola). It's usually a sign of breast cancer in the tissue behind the nipple. About 1 to 4% of women with breast cancer have Paget's disease of the nipple. It can also affect men, but this is extremely rare. The term Paget's disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from Paget's disease of the bone (where bones become weak and deformed). Symptoms of Paget's disease of the nipple Paget's disease of the nipple always starts in the nipple and may extend to the areola. It appears as a red, scaly rash on the skin of the nipple and areola. The affected skin is often sore and inflamed, and it can be itchy or cause a burning sensation. The nipple can sometimes be ulcerated. Credit: CID, ISM /SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/459439/view The rash is often similar in appearance to other skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis . If you scratch it, or if it's left untreated, it can bleed, become ulcerated or scab over. If you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and is not red or scaly, it's unlikely to be Paget's disease of the nipple. However, you should still have it checked by a doctor. Around half of all women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have a lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10 cases this is an invasive breast cancer. Invasive cancer is where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue. Some women with Paget's disease have invasive breast cancer but do not have a lump. However, most women with Paget's disease who do not have a lump have non-invasive cancer. This is where the cancerous cells are contained in 1 or more areas of the breast and have not spread. Causes of Paget's disease of the nipple The cause of Paget's disease of the nipple is unknown. Some women appear to be more at risk of developing breast cancer, but not specifically Paget's disease. There are no known causes that lead to a specific type of breast cancer. In terms of risk factors, you're more likely to develop breast cancer if you: are older – the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age have close relatives with breast cancer have had breast cancer before have had a type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease before – certain types of benign breast disease may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but this is only seen in a very small number of women are overweight or living with obesity, particularly if you've been through the menopause (you can use the BMI calculator to check if you're a healthy weight) drink a lot of alcohol – your risk can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink Read more about the risk factors for breast cancer . Diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple You should see your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola. As Paget's disease of the nipple is associated with breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be. Also see your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. Although most breast lumps are not cancerous, it's important to have them checked out. A biopsy is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of Paget's disease of the nipple. A small tissue sample (punch biopsy of the skin) will be taken from your nipple and examined under a microscope to see if it's cancerous. If the results of the biopsy indicate Paget's disease, you'll have a mammogram (a low-dose breast X-ray ) to investigate further. Read more about diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple . Treating Paget's disease of the nipple Surgery is the main treatment for Paget's disease of the nipple. Depending on whether the cancer has spread, surgery will either involve removing the whole breast (a mastectomy ), or the nipple and areola with the breast tissue underneath them (a central excision). If the whole of your breast is removed, breast reconstruction surgery can be used to create a breast shape to match your remaining breast. You may also need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer. This may be a combination of: chemotherapy – where powerful medicine is used to destroy cancerous cells radiotherapy – where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells targeted or hormone therapy – which lowers the risk of cancer returning in the same breast (and affecting the other breast), and it lowers the risk of cancerous cells spreading elsewhere in the body If Paget's disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there's a good chance of a full recovery. Read more about treating Paget's disease of the nipple . Reducing the risk of breast cancer, including Paget's disease of the nipple Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and making sure you exercise regularly , may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. Breast cancer screening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. In the UK, the NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women aged 50 to 70. In some areas, women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 are also invited for screening as part of a study looking at whether the age range for breast screening should be extended.

    "title": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/interstitial-cystitis/",
    "text": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis) Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a poorly understood condition where you have pelvic pain and problems peeing. It's sometimes called interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome. It's difficult to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis) as there is no single test that confirms the condition. Symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) The main symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) include: intense pelvic pain (felt over your lower tummy) sudden strong urges to pee needing to pee more often than usual pain in your lower tummy when your bladder is filling up, which is relieved when you pee waking up several times during the night to pee Other symptoms can include finding it difficult to pee, urinary incontinence and blood in your urine (haematuria). These symptoms can sometimes be caused by other conditions, such as cancer of the bladder. This is why you'll need a range of tests to rule out other possible causes before BPS (interstitial cystitis) can be diagnosed. Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you have blood in your urine and pain in your lower tummy. Blood in your pee may be bright pink, red or dark brown. Who gets BPS (interstitial cystitis) Although BPS (interstitial cystitis) can affect people of all ages, it's much more common in women than men, usually over the age of 30. The symptoms will often come and go over time. There may be times lasting days, weeks or months where your symptoms improve, followed by flare-ups when they're worse. You might also find the pain is worse during your period or after having certain foods or drinks. It can have a big impact on your everyday life, including work, mental health and relationships. But when a diagnosis is confirmed there are different treatments that can help. What causes interstitial cystitis? The exact cause of BPS (interstitial cystitis) is not clear. However, there are several ideas about what might cause it. These include: damage to the bladder lining, which may mean pee can irritate the bladder and surrounding nerves a problem with the pelvic floor muscles used to control peeing your immune system causing an inflammatory reaction Some people who have been diagnosed with BPS (interstitial cystitis), may have a long-term (chronic) urinary infection (UTI) in the bladder, which has not been picked up by current urine tests. BPS (interstitial cystitis) may also be associated with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia , myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . When to see a GP See a GP if: you have pelvic pain that does not go away you notice a change in your usual peeing pattern and it is affecting your daily life Ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have blood in your pee. What happens when you see a GP BPS (interstitial cystitis) can have similar symptoms to long-term or frequent UTIs, so the GP may give you a urine test to check for a UTI. Standard urine tests used in GP surgeries and hospitals may not pick up all infections of the bladder. You may be prescribed antibiotics to see if they help. A GP may also suggest simple treatments such as: keeping a food diary and avoiding foods and drinks that make your symptoms worse stopping smoking – chemicals in tobacco can irritate your bladder When to ask a GP for referral to a hospital specialist Treatments from the GP may not always work. If your symptoms keep coming back or do not go away, ask the GP to refer you to a urologist specialising in female urology or a urogynaecologist. Men may be referred to a urologist. How is BPS (interstitial cystitis) diagnosed? There is no single test to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis). You may have several tests to exclude other causes of your symptoms before a diagnosis can be confirmed. The tests offered may include: cystoscopy – a procedure to look inside your bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope urine tests ultrasound , MRI scan or CT scan of the urinary tract and sometimes of the kidneys too urodynamics – a range of tests to check the function of your bladder and urethra vaginal swabs Ask your doctor to explain what tests you are being offered and what they're for. Treatments for BPS (interstitial cystitis) When you have been diagnosed by a specialist as having BPS (interstitial cystitis), there are several treatments that may help. No single treatment works for everyone, and there is no conclusive evidence they work. You may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the treatments offered to you and why. Medicines Tablets or capsules may be used to treat people with BPS (interstitial cystitis). These include: over-the-counter painkillers – such as paracetamol and ibuprofen medicines for nerve pain – such as amitriptyline , gabapentin and pregabalin tolterodine , solifenacin or mirabegron – these can reduce the urgency to pee a prescription medicine that may help by blocking the effect of a substance called histamine in the bladder pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) – this may reduce pain (this can only be prescribed by a specialist as it's only suitable for some people) Bladder instillations Some medicines can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter . These are known as intravesical medicines or bladder instillations. Examples of intravesical medicines include: lignocaine - a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder, a mixture of compounds including steroids, sodium bicarbonate and heparin are used hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate – this may help restore the bladder lining antibiotics alone or combined with a local anaesthetic and steroid – this can calm inflammation and reduce infection As with oral medicines, the evidence is not conclusive for bladder instillations. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the different options. Supportive therapies and treatments Some people may also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful: physiotherapy – a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist can help you relax your muscles to ease pain. acupuncture – may help with pain relief talking therapies and counselling – to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your life transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your body pain management – ask the GP to refer you to a pain specialist Surgery and procedures Surgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments do not work. Procedures that may be carried out include: cauterisation – ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laser bladder distension – the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve symptoms botulinum toxin injections (such as Botox) – injected directly into your bladder wall to temporarily relieve symptoms of frequent peeing and pain. neuromodulation – an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to pee In very rare cases, and only as a last resort, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy). If this is done, your surgeon may need to create an alternative way for pee to leave your body. Things you can do to help BPS (interstitial cystitis) Things that may help improve your symptoms include: reducing stress – try exercise, warm baths and mindfulness-based meditation techniques making sure you are hydrated regularly throughout the day keeping a food diary – if you notice certain foods or drinks (like citrus fruits and alcohol) make symptoms worse, avoid them, but ask for medical advice first stopping smoking – the chemicals in cigarettes can irritate your bladder Information: More information and support Bladder Health UK has information and forums on BPS (interstitial cystitis), as well as other bladder conditions Page last reviewed: 18 February 2022 Next review due: 18 February 2025"

The pancreas is a small organ, located behind the stomach, that helps with digestion. Most people with acute pancreatitis start to feel better within about a week and have no further problems. But some people with severe acute pancreatitis can go on to develop serious complications. Acute pancreatitis is different to chronic pancreatitis , where the pancreas has become permanently damaged from inflammation over many years. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis The most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include: suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your tummy (abdomen) feeling or being sick a high temperature of 38C or more (fever) Read more about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and diagnosing acute pancreatitis . When to get medical help See a GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn't possible, contact NHS 111 for advice. Causes of acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to: gallstones drinking too much alcohol But sometimes the cause is not known. By reducing how much alcohol you drink and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis. Read more about the causes of acute pancreatitis and preventing acute pancreatitis . How it's treated Treatment for acute pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and manage any symptoms. This usually involves admission to hospital. You may be given fluids directly into a vein (intravenous fluids), pain relief, liquid food through a tube in your tummy and oxygen through tubes in your nose. Most people with acute pancreatitis get better within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after a few days.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-pancreatitis/",
    "text": "Overview - Chronic pancreatitis Contents Overview Treatment Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas has become permanently damaged from inflammation and stops working properly. The pancreas is a small organ, located behind the stomach, that helps with digestion. Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age. It is more common in men. It's different from acute pancreatitis , where the inflammation is only short term. Most people with chronic pancreatitis have had 1 or more attacks of acute pancreatitis. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of severe pain in your tummy (abdomen). The pain usually develops in the middle or left side of your tummy and can move along your back. It's been described as a burning or shooting pain that comes and goes, but may last for several hours or days. Although the pain sometimes comes on after eating a meal, there's often no trigger. Some people might feel sick and vomit. As the condition progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe. Eventually, a constant dull pain can develop in your tummy, between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Some people who stop drinking alcohol and stop smoking may find the pain is less severe. Advanced chronic pancreatitis Other symptoms develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses and it becomes unable to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food. The absence of digestive juices means it's harder to break down fats and some proteins. This can cause your poo to become very smelly and greasy, and make it difficult to flush down the toilet. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the first symptoms started. You may also experience: weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) symptoms of diabetes – such as feeling very thirsty, needing to pee more often than usual and feeling very tired ongoing nausea and sickness (vomiting) When to get medical advice See a GP immediately if you're experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong. If this is not possible, contact NHS 111 for advice. You should also see a GP as soon as you can if: your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow (jaundice) you keep being sick Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it's usually a sign there's something wrong with your digestive system. Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis A GP will ask about your symptoms and may examine you. They'll refer you to a specialist for further tests if they think you have chronic pancreatitis. The specialist will be able to confirm whether you have the condition. Tests Tests and scans are usually carried out in your local hospital. They may include: an ultrasound scan – where sound waves are used to create a picture of your pancreas a CT scan – where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed 3D image of your pancreas an endoscopic ultrasound scan – where a long, thin tube containing a camera is passed through your mouth and down into your stomach to take pictures of your pancreas magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) – a type of MRI scan that takes a detailed image of your pancreas and the organs around it Biopsy Sometimes the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar to pancreatic cancer. You may need a biopsy , where a small sample of cells is taken from the pancreas and sent to a laboratory to be checked, to rule this out. Causes of chronic pancreatitis The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years. This can cause repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis , which results in increasing damage to the organ. Find out more about alcohol misuse In children the most common cause is cystic fibrosis . Less common causes include: smoking the immune system attacking the pancreas (autoimmune chronic pancreatitis) inheriting a faulty gene that stops the pancreas working properly injury to the pancreas gallstones blocking the openings (ducts) of the pancreas radiotherapy to the tummy In some cases, no cause can be identified. This is called idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. Treatment for chronic pancreatitis The damage to the pancreas is permanent, but treatment can help control the condition and manage any symptoms. People with chronic pancreatitis are usually advised to make lifestyle changes, such as stopping drinking alcohol and stopping smoking. They're also given medicine to relieve pain. Surgery may also be an option for those experiencing severe pain. Complications Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. See a GP if you're experiencing stress , anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis. Some people with chronic pancreatitis will eventually develop a type of diabetes known as type 3c diabetes. This occurs when the pancreas can no longer produce insulin because it's become so damaged. People with chronic pancreatitis can sometimes develop sacs of fluid on the surface of their pancreas (pseudocysts). These can cause bloating, indigestion and dull tummy pain. These cysts often disappear on their own. But sometimes they need to be drained using a technique called endoscopic ultrasound drainage, or endoscopic transpapillary drainage. Chronic pancreatitis increases your risk of pancreatic cancer , although the chance is still small. Support for people living with chronic pancreatitis Any long-term health condition, particularly one that causes recurring episodes of pain or constant pain, can affect your emotional and psychological health. See a GP if you're experiencing psychological and emotional difficulties. There are medicines available that can help with stress, anxiety and depression. Talking to other people with the same condition can often reduce feelings of isolation and stress. The charity Guts UK , may be able to put you in touch with a support group.

    "text": "Overview - Parkinson's disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Parkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease The main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are: involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body (tremor) slow movement stiff and inflexible muscles A person with Parkinson's disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms. These include: depression and anxiety balance problems (this may increase the chances of a fall ) loss of sense of smell (anosmia) problems sleeping (insomnia) memory problems Seeking medical advice See a GP if you're concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease. They'll ask about the problems you're experiencing and may refer you to a specialist for further tests. Find out more about diagnosing Parkinson's disease Causes of Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain. Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible. Who's affected Most people with Parkinson's start to develop symptoms when they're over 50, although some people with the condition first experience symptoms when they're under 40. Men are slightly more likely to get Parkinson's disease than women. Treating Parkinson's disease Although there's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible. These include: supportive treatments, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy medication in some cases, brain surgery You may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson's disease, as symptoms are usually mild. But you may need regular appointments with your specialist so your condition can be monitored. Outlook As the condition progresses, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can get worse and it can become increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities without help. Many people respond well to treatment and only experience mild to moderate disability, whereas the minority may not respond as well and can, in time, become more severely disabled. Parkinson's disease does not directly cause people to die, but the condition can place great strain on the body, and can make some people more vulnerable to serious and life-threatening infections. But with advances in treatment, most people with Parkinson's disease now have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.

    "title": "Patau's syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pataus-syndrome/",
    "text": "Patau's syndrome Patau's syndrome is a serious, rare genetic disorder caused by having an additional copy of chromosome 13 in some or all of the body's cells. It's also called trisomy 13. Each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry the genes you inherit from your parents. But a baby with Patau's syndrome has 3 copies of chromosome 13, instead of 2. This severely disrupts normal development and, in many cases, results in miscarriage , stillbirth or the baby dying shortly after birth. Babies with Patau's syndrome grow slowly in the womb and have a low birth weight, along with a number of other serious medical problems. Patau's syndrome affects about 1 in every 4,000 births. The risk of having a baby with the syndrome increases with the mother's age. More than 9 out of 10 children born with Patau's syndrome die during the first year. Symptoms and features Babies with Patau's syndrome can have a wide range of health problems. Their growth in the womb is often restricted, resulting in a low birth weight, and 8 out of 10 will be born with severe heart defects. The brain often does not divide into 2 halves. This is known as holoprosencephaly. When this happens, it can affect facial features and cause defects such as: cleft lip and palate an abnormally small eye or eyes (microphthalmia) absence of 1 or both eyes (anophthalmia) Other abnormalities of the face and head include: smaller than normal head size (microcephaly) ear malformations and deafness Patau's syndrome can also cause other problems, such as: an abdominal wall defect where the abdomen does not develop fully in the womb, resulting in the intestines being outside the body, covered only by a membrane – this is known as an exomphalos or omphalocoele abnormal cysts in the kidneys There may also be abnormalities of the hands and feet, such as extra fingers or toes (polydactyly) and a rounded bottom to the feet, known as rocker-bottom feet. Causes of Patau's syndrome Patau's syndrome happens by chance and is not caused by anything the parents have done. Most cases do not run in families (they're not inherited). They happen randomly during conception, when the sperm and egg combine and the foetus starts to develop. There's an error when the cells divide, resulting in an additional copy, or part of a copy, of chromosome 13, which severely affects the baby's development in the womb. In many cases, the baby dies before reaching full term (miscarriage) or is dead at birth (stillbirth) . In most cases of Patau's syndrome, a baby has a whole extra copy of chromosome number 13 in their body's cells. This is sometimes known as trisomy 13 or simple trisomy 13. In some cases of Patau's syndrome, genetic material is rearranged between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. This is called a chromosomal translocation. Patau's syndrome that arises because of this can be inherited. Sometimes only some cells have the extra copy of chromosome 13. This is known as trisomy 13 mosaicism. Occasionally, only part of 1 chromosome 13 is extra (partial trisomy 13). The symptoms and features of both mosaicism and partial trisomy tend to be less severe than in simple trisomy 13, resulting in more babies living longer. Genetic Alliance UK has more information about chromosome disorders Screening for Patau's syndrome You'll be offered a screening test for Patau's syndrome, as well as Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18), from 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. The test assesses your chances of having a baby with these syndromes. The screening test offered at 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy is called the combined test because it involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan . If the screening tests show you have a higher chance of having a baby with Patau's syndrome, you'll be offered a second screening test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). This is a blood test that can give you a more accurate screening result and help you to decide whether to have a diagnostic test or not. It's available free on the NHS. A diagnostic test will check the chromosomes in a sample of cells taken from your baby and helps to find out for certain if they have Patau's syndrome. Two techniques can be used to obtain the cell sample: amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) . These are invasive tests to remove a sample of tissue or fluid so it can be tested for the presence of the extra copy of chromosome 13. If you're not able to have the combined screening test, you'll be offered a scan that looks for physical abnormalities, including those found in Patau's syndrome. This is sometimes called the mid-pregnancy scan and is carried out when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant. Find out more about screening tests for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome Treating and managing Patau's syndrome There's no specific treatment for Patau's syndrome. As a result of the severe health problems a newborn baby with the syndrome will have, doctors usually focus on minimising discomfort and ensuring the baby is able to feed. For the small number of babies with Patau's syndrome who survive beyond the first few days of life, their care will depend on their specific symptoms and needs. If your baby is diagnosed with Patau's syndrome, either before birth or shortly afterwards, you'll be offered counselling and support. Genetic testing for parents Both parents will need to have their chromosomes analysed if their baby is affected by Patau's syndrome caused by a chromosomal translocation. Genetic testing is carried out to help parents plan for future pregnancies, rather than as part of the decision-making process for the current pregnancy. The test results will allow a more accurate assessment to be made of the likelihood of the syndrome affecting future pregnancies. Other family members may also be affected and should be tested. Find out more about genetic and genomic testing Information about your child If your child has Patau's syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service on GOV.UK Further information and support These organisations are useful further sources of information about Patau's syndrome.

    "title": "Overview-Pelvic inflammatory disease",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid/",
    "text": "Overview - Pelvic inflammatory disease Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive system, which includes the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. Symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) PID often does not cause any obvious symptoms. Most symptoms are mild and may include 1 or more of the following: pain around the pelvis or lower tummy discomfort or pain during sex that's felt deep inside the pelvis pain when peeing bleeding between periods and after sex heavy periods painful periods unusual vaginal discharge , especially if it's yellow, green or smelly A few people become very ill with: severe pain in the tummy a high temperature (fever) feeling and being sick When to seek medical advice It's important to visit a GP or a sexual health clinic if you experience any symptoms of PID. If you have severe pain, you should seek urgent medical attention from your GP or local A&E department. Delaying treatment for PID or having repeated episodes of PID can increase your risk of serious and long-term complications. There's no simple test to diagnose PID. Diagnosis is based on your symptoms and the finding of tenderness during a vaginal (internal) examination. Swabs will be taken from your vagina and the neck of the womb (cervix), but negative swabs do not rule out PID. Causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Most cases of PID are caused by a bacterial infection that's spread from the vagina or the cervix to the reproductive organs higher up. Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. In many cases, it's caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) , such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea . Another type of STI called mycoplasma genitalium is thought to be increasingly responsible for cases of PID. In many other cases, it's caused by bacteria that normally live in the vagina. Treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) If diagnosed at an early stage, PID can be treated with a course of antibiotics, which usually lasts for 14 days. You'll be given a mixture of antibiotics to cover the most likely infections, and often an injection as well as tablets. It's important to complete the whole course and avoid having sexual intercourse during this time to help ensure the infection clears. Your recent sexual partners should also be treated for any sexually transmitted infections that may have caused your PID. This will help stop it coming back or spreading to other people. Complications The fallopian tubes can become scarred and narrowed if they're affected by PID. This can make it difficult for eggs to pass from the ovaries into the womb. This can increase your chances of a pregnancy that grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes ( ectopic pregnancy ). This type of pregnancy cannot be saved and can cause life-threatening problems. If you keep getting PID or treatment is delayed, it can increase your risk of infertility . Preventing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) You can reduce your risk of PID by always using barrier contraception, such as condoms , with a new sexual partner until they have had a sexual health check. Chlamydia is very common and most people do not have any symptoms. If you're worried you may have an STI, visit your local genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic for advice. If you need an invasive gynaecological procedure, such as insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) or an abortion , have a check-up beforehand.

    "title": "Overview-Pelvic organ prolapse",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/",
    "text": "Overview - Pelvic organ prolapse Contents Overview Treatment Pelvic organ prolapse is when 1 or more of the organs in the pelvis slip down from their normal position and bulge into the vagina. It can be the womb (uterus), bowel, bladder or top of the vagina. A prolapse is not life threatening, but it can cause pain and discomfort. Symptoms can usually be improved with pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes, but sometimes medical treatment is needed. Symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms include: a feeling of heaviness around your lower tummy and genitals a dragging discomfort inside your vagina feeling like there's something coming down into your vagina – it may feel like sitting on a small ball feeling or seeing a bulge or lump in or coming out of your vagina discomfort or numbness during sex problems peeing – such as feeling like your bladder is not emptying fully, needing to go to the toilet more often, or leaking a small amount of pee when you cough, sneeze or exercise (stress incontinence) Sometimes pelvic organ prolapse has no symptoms and is found during an internal examination carried out for another reason, such as cervical screening . When to see a GP See a GP if you have any of the symptoms of a prolapse, or if you notice a lump in or around your vagina. What happens at your appointment Your doctor will ask if they can do an internal pelvic examination. For this you'll need to undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination bed. Your doctor will then feel for any lumps in your pelvic area and inside your vagina. They may gently put an instrument called a speculum into your vagina to hold the walls of it open so they can see if there's a prolapse. Sometimes they'll ask you to lie on your left-hand side and examine you in that position to get a better view of the prolapse. You can ask for this examination to be done by a female doctor and, if you like, bring someone you trust along with you for support. Further tests If you have problems with your bladder, a GP may refer you to hospital for further tests. These may include: a urine test to look for an infection inserting a small tube into your bladder to look for any problems Treatment for pelvic organ prolapse If you do not have any symptoms, or the prolapse is mild and not bothering you, you may not need medical treatment. But making some lifestyle changes will probably still help. These include: losing weight if you're overweight avoiding heavy lifting preventing or treating constipation If the prolapse is more severe or your symptoms are affecting your daily life, there are several further treatment options to consider. These include: pelvic floor exercises hormone treatment vaginal pessaries surgery The recommended treatment will depend on the type and severity of the prolapse, your symptoms and your overall health. You and your doctor will decide together what's the best option for you. Causes of pelvic organ prolapse Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the group of muscles and tissues that normally support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened and cannot hold the organs in place firmly. A number of things can weaken your pelvic floor and increase your chance of developing pelvic organ prolapse. These include: pregnancy and childbirth – especially if you had a long, difficult birth, or if you gave birth to a large baby or multiple babies getting older and going through the menopause being overweight having long-term constipation or a long-term health condition that causes you to cough and strain having a hysterectomy a job that requires a lot of heavy lifting Some health conditions can also make a prolapse more likely, including: joint hypermobility syndrome Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndromes Types of prolapse The 4 main types of prolapse are: the bladder bulging into the front wall of the vagina (anterior prolapse) the womb bulging or hanging down into the vagina (uterine prolapse) the top of the vagina sagging down – this happens to some women after they have had surgery to remove their womb the bowel bulging forward into the back wall of the vagina (posterior wall prolapse) It's possible to have more than 1 of these at the same time. Pelvic organ prolapse will usually be classified on a scale of 1 to 4 to show how severe it is, with 4 being a severe prolapse.

Do not try to diagnose yourself. See a GP if you're worried. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have blisters or sore patches in your mouth or on your skin that do not go away or keep coming back Treatments for pemphigus vulgaris If a GP thinks you could have pemphigus vulgaris, they can refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) for tests and treatment. Blisters caused by pemphigus vulgaris usually come and go over time. There's no cure, but treatment can help. The main treatments are: steroid tablets other medicines such as azathioprine , methotrexate and rituximab It usually takes a few weeks for the blisters to heal. Once this happens, you'll probably need treatment for several years to help stop the blisters coming back. It may be possible to stop treatment eventually. If the blisters come back, you may need to repeat treatment. Things you can do if you have pemphigus vulgaris If you have pemphigus vulgaris, there are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms and reduce the risk of further problems. Do clean your teeth using a soft toothbrush and mint-free toothpaste use antiseptic or painkilling (anaesthetic) mouthwash (try to avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol) keep any sore patches clean to reduce the risk of infection have regular dental check-ups Don’t do not eat spicy, acidic or hard foods if you have blisters in your mouth do not do activities that could damage your skin (such as contact sports) if you have blisters on your skin Complications of pemphigus vulgaris Pemphigus vulgaris can lead to other problems, such as: blisters and sore patches becoming infected, which can cause life-threatening problems such as sepsis weight loss and malnutrition because of pain when eating and drinking tooth decay and gum disease because it can be painful to look after your teeth and gums pain during sex and pain when peeing or pooing (if your genitals or anus are affected) You'll have regular check-ups to look for these problems and may be referred to other specialists (such as a dietitian) if needed. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your blisters or sore patches are very painful or feel hot there is yellow or green pus coming from your blisters or sore patches These are signs of an infection, which needs to be treated quickly. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Causes of pemphigus vulgaris Pemphigus vulgaris is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body’s defence against infection. Instead of attacking germs, something goes wrong with the immune system and it attacks the skin by mistake. This damages the skin and causes blisters to appear. It’s not clear why this happens. It’s not passed on in families and it’s not caused by an infection, so it cannot spread to other people. Support if you have pemphigus vulgaris Living with pemphigus vulgaris can be very difficult. As well as support from your care team, it may help to get information and support from groups and charities such as: Pemphigus Vulgaris Network – a UK support group for people with pemphigus vulgaris PEM Friends – a UK support group for people with pemphigus vulgaris and related conditions International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation – a global support group for people with pemphigus vulgaris and related conditions Page last reviewed: 30 May 2022 Next review due: 30 May 2025"

To confirm pericarditis, the GP may: do some blood tests refer you for a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram in hospital ECGs are safe and painless, and some GPs can do them at the surgery. Treatment for pericarditis Treatment for pericarditis will depend on what's causing it. You may be given anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen , to help ease symptoms like pain. Sitting up or leaning forward can also help ease the pain. You may need other treatment. For example, a GP may prescribe medicines such as: colchicine – if anti-inflammatory painkillers do not work or pericarditis keeps coming back steroids – if colchicine does not work antibiotics – if pericarditis is caused by a bacterial infection Most people feel better within a few weeks. Causes of pericarditis Your heart has a protective fluid-filled sac around it called the pericardium. In pericarditis, the pericardium gets inflamed, and blood or fluid can leak into it.

    "text": "Overview - Periods Contents Overview Starting your periods Period problems A period is the part of the menstrual cycle when a woman bleeds from her vagina for a few days. For most women this happens around every 28 days, but it's common for periods to be more or less frequent than this, ranging from every 21 days to every 35 days. Your period can last between 2 and 7 days, but it will usually last for about 5 days. The bleeding tends to be heaviest in the first 2 days. When your period is at its heaviest, the blood will be red. On lighter days, it may be pink or brown. You'll lose about 20 to 90ml (about 1 to 5 tablespoons) of blood during your period, although some women bleed more heavily than this. Read more about heavy periods , period pain , irregular periods and stopped or missed periods . When do periods start? Periods usually begin at around the age of 12, although some girls will start them earlier or later. A delay in starting periods isn't usually a cause for concern. Most girls will be having regular periods by age 16 to 18. Read more about early or delayed puberty . Period products Period products soak up or collect the blood released during your period. The main types of period products are: pads tampons menstrual cups Pads Pads are strips of padding that have a sticky side you attach to your underwear to hold them in place. One side of the pad is made of an absorbent material that soaks up the blood. Pads come in many sizes, so you can choose one to suit how heavy or light your period is. You can also get reusable washable pads. Pantyliners are a smaller and thinner type of pad that can be used on days when your period is very light. Tampons Tampons are small tubes of cotton wool that you insert into your vagina to soak up the blood before it comes out of your body. There are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it. Tampons come with instructions that explain how to use them. If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not be able to feel it inside you. If you can feel it or it hurts, it might not be in properly. It is not possible for a tampon to get lost inside you. Your vagina holds it firmly in place and it expands inside you as it soaks up the blood. Menstrual cups Menstrual cups are an alternative to pads and tampons. The cup is made from silicone and you put it inside your vagina. Menstrual cups collect the blood rather than absorb it. Unlike tampons and most pads, which are thrown away after they've been used, you can wash menstrual cups and use them again. Period underwear Period underwear are pants made from absorbent fabric. They soak up blood in the same way as pads, and have a layer to prevent leaks. They're designed to be washed and reused. PMS (premenstrual syndrome) Changes in your body's hormone levels before your period can cause physical and emotional changes. This is known as PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or PMT (premenstrual tension). There are many possible symptoms of PMS, but typical symptoms include: feeling bloated breast tenderness mood swings feeling irritable spotty skin low sex drive (loss of libido) headaches These symptoms usually improve when your period starts and disappear a few days afterwards. Not all women who have periods get PMS. Getting pregnant Working out when you can get pregnant – your fertile time – can be difficult. It's around the time you ovulate, which is about 12 to 16 days before the start of your next period. But sperm can survive inside a woman's body for up to 7 days before ovulation occurs. This means your fertile time extends back earlier in your cycle. You can calculate when your period will start and your peak ovulation times using an online period calendar. You cannot get pregnant if you do not ovulate. Some hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill , contraceptive patch and contraceptive injection , work by preventing ovulation. Read more about periods and fertility in the menstrual cycle , infertility , contraception and trying to get pregnant . Changes in your periods Your periods can change – for example, they may last longer or get lighter. This does not necessarily mean there's a problem, but it does need to be investigated. You can see your GP, or visit your nearest women's clinic or contraceptive clinic . Bleeding between periods , bleeding after having sex, or bleeding after the menopause needs to be checked by a doctor. It might be caused by an infection, abnormalities in the neck of the womb (the cervix) or, in rare cases, it could be cancer . You could be pregnant if you miss a period and you've had sex. See your GP if you've taken a pregnancy test and the result is negative (you're not pregnant) and you've missed 3 consecutive periods. They will investigate the cause and recommend any necessary treatment. Read more about stopped or missed periods . When do periods stop? Your periods will continue until you reach the menopause , which usually happens when you are in your mid-40s to mid-50s. In the UK the average age of menopause is 51. Your periods will not usually stop suddenly when you go through the menopause. They may start to become less frequent over a few months or years before stopping altogether. Delaying your period It’s possible to delay your period if you take the combined contraceptive pill. How you do this depends on the type of combined pill you take. Speak to a GP or pharmacist, or a doctor or nurse at a sexual health clinic, about how to delay your period using the combined pill. If you do not take the combined pill already, you will need to start it a few weeks before the time you want to delay your period. If you do not want to take the contraceptive pill, your GP can prescribe a medicine called norethisterone to delay your periods, but this is not suitable for everyone.

    "text": "Heavy periods Many women have heavy periods (also called menorrhagia) and they may be normal for you. They can affect anyone who has periods. Treatment can help if they're affecting your daily life. What are heavy periods? You may have heavy periods if you: need to change your pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours, or empty your menstrual cup more often than is recommended need to use 2 types of period product together, such as a pad and a tampon have periods lasting more than 7 days pass blood clots larger than about 2.5cm (the size of a 10p coin) bleed through to your clothes or bedding avoid daily activities, like exercise, or take time off work because of your periods feel tired or short of breath a lot Causes of heavy periods It can be normal to have heavy periods. They can sometimes be heavy at different times, like when you first start your periods, after pregnancy or approaching menopause . Sometimes heavy periods can be caused by: conditions affecting your womb or ovaries, such as polycystic ovary syndrome , fibroids , endometriosis , adenomyosis and pelvic inflammatory disease conditions that can make you bleed more easily, such as Von Willebrand disease some medicines and treatments, including some anticoagulant medicines and chemotherapy medicines Rarely, heavy periods can be a sign of womb cancer . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: heavy periods are affecting your life you've had heavy periods for some time you have severe pain during your periods you bleed between periods or after sex you have heavy periods and other symptoms, such as pain when peeing, pooing or having sex Treatment for heavy periods Heavy periods do not always need to be treated. But there are treatments that can help if they’re affecting your daily life. Treatments from a GP include: some types of contraception, such as an intrauterine system (IUS) or the combined contraceptive pill medicine to help reduce the bleeding, such as tranexamic acid prescription-only anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as mefenamic acid or naproxen If these treatments do not work or a GP thinks a condition may be causing your heavy periods, they’ll usually refer you for tests or to see a specialist. Specialist treatments Specialist treatments for heavy periods include: removing the lining of the womb (endometrial ablation) removing fibroids if it’s thought they’re causing your heavy periods total or partial removal of the womb ( hysterectomy ) You may have a series of blood tests to check if you have any underlying conditions, such as iron deficiency anaemia.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/peripheral-arterial-disease-pad/",
    "text": "Overview - Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Contents Overview Diagnosis Treatment Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles. It's also known as peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease Many people with PAD have no symptoms. However, some develop a painful ache in their legs when they walk, which usually disappears after a few minutes' rest. The medical term for this is \"intermittent claudication\". The pain can range from mild to severe, and usually goes away after a few minutes when you rest your legs. Both legs are often affected at the same time, although the pain may be worse in 1 leg. Other symptoms of PAD can include: hair loss on your legs and feet numbness or weakness in the legs brittle, slow-growing toenails ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs, which do not heal changing skin colour on your legs, such as turning paler than usual or blue – this may be harder to see on brown and black skin shiny skin in men, erectile dysfunction the muscles in your legs shrinking (wasting) The symptoms of PAD often develop slowly, over time. If your symptoms develop quickly, or get suddenly worse, it could be a sign of a serious problem requiring immediate treatment. When to see a GP You should see a GP if you experience recurring leg pain when exercising. Many people mistakenly think this is just part of growing older, but there's no reason why an otherwise healthy person should experience leg pain. PAD is usually diagnosed through a physical examination by a GP, and by comparing the blood pressure in your arm and your ankle. A difference between the 2 may indicate PAD and is called the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI). Read about diagnosing PAD . Causes of peripheral arterial disease PAD is a form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it affects the blood vessels. It's usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the walls of the leg arteries. The fatty deposits (atheroma) are made up of cholesterol and other waste substances. The build-up of fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries makes the arteries narrower and restricts blood flow to the legs. This process is called atherosclerosis . There are certain things that can increase your chances of developing PAD and other forms of CVD, including: smoking – the most significant risk factor type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes high blood pressure (hypertension) high cholesterol growing older Treating peripheral arterial disease PAD is largely treated through lifestyle changes and medication. Exercising regularly and not smoking are the main lifestyle changes that can ease the symptoms of PAD and reduce the chances of it getting worse. It's also important to: eat a healthy diet lose weight, if you're overweight or obese moderate your consumption of alcohol Read about: Stopping smoking Exercise The underlying causes should also be treated, including high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes . Medicine and, in some cases, surgery can be used to improve the blood flow in your legs. With treatment, most people's symptoms remain stable and some people may experience an improvement in their pain. If treatment is unsuccessful, there's a risk of potentially serious complications. Read about treating PAD . Complications of peripheral arterial disease PAD is not immediately life-threatening, but the process of atherosclerosis that causes it can lead to serious and potentially fatal problems. Coronary heart disease (CHD) The blockages in the arteries in the legs can also affect other areas of your body, such as the arteries supplying the heart and brain. This means that having PAD makes you more likely to develop another form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) , such as: coronary heart disease stroke heart attack angina Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) If the blood flow to the legs becomes severely restricted, critical limb ischaemia (CLI) can develop. CLI is an extremely serious complication that can be challenging to treat. Symptoms of CLI include: a severe burning pain in your legs and feet that continues even when you're resting your skin turning pale, shiny, smooth and dry wounds and ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs that do not heal loss of muscle mass in your legs the skin on your toes or lower limbs becoming cold and numb, turning red and then black, and/or beginning to swell and produce smelly pus, causing severe pain ( gangrene ) – changes in skin colour may be harder to see on brown and black skin If you think you're developing symptoms of CLI, contact a GP immediately. If this is not possible call 111 or use 111 online . An angioplasty or bypass graft is usually recommended if you have CLI, although these may not always be successful or possible. In a few cases, an amputation below the knee may be required. Page last reviewed: 20 March 2023 Next review due: 20 March 2026 Next : Diagnosis"

    "title": "Overview-Peripheral neuropathy",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/",
    "text": "Overview - Peripheral neuropathy Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Peripheral neuropathy develops when nerves in the body's extremities, such as the hands, feet and arms, are damaged. The symptoms depend on which nerves are affected. In the UK it's estimated almost 1 in 10 people aged 55 or over are affected by peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral nervous system The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). It includes different types of nerves with their own specific functions, including: sensory nerves – responsible for transmitting sensations, such as pain and touch motor nerves – responsible for controlling muscles autonomic nerves – responsible for regulating automatic functions of the body, such as blood pressure and bladder function Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy The main symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can include: numbness and tingling in the feet or hands burning, stabbing or shooting pain in affected areas loss of balance and co-ordination muscle weakness, especially in the feet These symptoms are usually constant, but may come and go. When to see a GP It's important to see a GP if you experience the early symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. These include: pain, tingling or loss of sensation in the feet loss of balance or weakness a cut or ulcer on your foot that's not getting better It's also recommended that people at highest risk of peripheral neuropathy, such as people with diabetes , have regular check-ups. A GP will ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests to help identify the underlying cause. You may be referred to hospital to see a neurologist, a specialist in health problems affecting the nervous system. Generally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better the chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications. Find out more about diagnosing peripheral neuropathy Causes of peripheral neuropathy In the UK diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Over time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves. This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes. For example, it can be caused by: physical injury to the nerves a viral infection, such as shingles a side effect of certain medicines or drinking too much alcohol People who are known to be at an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed. Treating peripheral neuropathy Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause. Not all of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated. For example, if you have diabetes, it may help to gain better control of your blood sugar level, stop smoking and cut down on alcohol. Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medicines called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers often do not work. If you have other symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy, these may need to be treated individually. For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy and walking aids. Complications of peripheral neuropathy The outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged. Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time. If the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy is not treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. This can lead to gangrene if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the foot has to be amputated. Peripheral neuropathy may affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy). You may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or, in rare cases, a pacemaker . Find out more about complications of peripheral neuropathy Different types of peripheral neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy may affect: only 1 nerve (mononeuropathy) several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex) all the nerves in the body (polyneuropathy) Polyneuropathy is the most common type and starts by affecting the longest nerves first, so symptoms typically begin in the feet. Over time it gradually starts to affect shorter nerves, so feels as if it's spreading upwards, and later affects the hands.

    "text": "Peritonitis Peritonitis is an infection of the inner lining of your tummy. Left untreated, it can become life threatening. Symptoms of peritonitis Symptoms of peritonitis include: tummy pain a very high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery a rapid heartbeat (your heart is beating more quickly than normal) not being able to pee or peeing much less than normal You might also have: a lack of appetite and feel or be sick a swollen tummy Important If you're having kidney dialysis treatment, the fluid in the collection bag might look cloudier than usual or contain white flecks. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have symptoms of peritonitis Serious complications like sepsis can happen if the infection spreads. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Causes of peritonitis The lining of the tummy (peritoneum) covers internal organs like the kidneys, liver and bowel. If the lining becomes infected and you get peritonitis, the internal organs it covers can also be damaged. This most often happens because of things like: a burst stomach ulcer a burst appendix digestive problems, such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis pancreatitis surgery injury to the stomach pelvic inflammatory disease cirrhosis Rarely, if bacteria gets into peritoneal dialysis equipment used to treat people with kidney failure, this can cause infection. Treatment for peritonitis If you're diagnosed with peritonitis, you'll need treatment in hospital to get rid of the infection. Treatment usually involves being given antibiotics into a vein (intravenously). If you have regular kidney dialysis, your doctor might discuss a different way of doing it until the peritonitis has been treated. Help with eating during treatment It can be difficult to digest food if you have peritonitis. A feeding tube might be passed into your stomach through your nose or placed inside your stomach using keyhole surgery. If a feeding tube cannot be used, liquid nutrients can be given directly into one of your veins. Surgery for peritonitis If part of your stomach lining has been seriously damaged by infection, you may need surgery to remove it. Sometimes pus-filled swellings (abscesses) develop in the lining and need to be drained with a needle under local anaesthetic. You might also need an operation to deal with the cause of the peritonitis. For example, a burst appendix will need to be removed. Page last reviewed: 01 August 2023 Next review due: 01 August 2026"

It can be painful but there are treatments to ease the symptoms and stop it getting worse. Check if it's Peyronie's disease Peyronie's disease mainly affects men over 40, but younger men can also get it. It can affect any adult with a penis. Credit: Multimedia Team - nhs.uk Symptoms of Peyronie's disease include: swelling that later causes a hard lump to develop on the shaft of your penis and stops it stretching during erections a curve in your penis when it's erect (if the hard area is on the top of your penis it will curve upwards, if it's on the bottom it will curve downwards) painful erections that can make having sex difficult problems getting or keeping an erection ( erectile dysfunction ) other changes to your penis – for example, you may have a hard area on the top, bottom and side of your penis, shortening it and making it narrower in the middle If you have Peyronie's disease, your skin may also be thicker and less flexible in other parts of your body, such as in your hands and feet. For example, some men with Peyronie's can also have a condition called Dupuytren's contracture . Information: Penises vary a lot in size and shape. There may naturally be a slight curve in your penis when it's erect. But get medical help if your penis curves a lot or erections are painful. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have swelling or a hard lump on your penis your penis curves upwards or downwards when it's erect you have painful erections, or problems getting or keeping an erection, which make having sex difficult Do not feel embarrassed about getting help. Peyronie's disease is a common problem that GPs are used to dealing with. What happens at your GP appointment If a GP thinks you might have Peyronie's disease, they'll ask about your symptoms and will usually need to examine your penis. They may refer you for an ultrasound scan . Treatments for Peyronie's disease If you have Peyronie's disease and your symptoms are mild, treatment may not be needed. But you may need treatment if your symptoms are severe or causing problems, such as pain during sex, depression or low self-esteem. Treatments for Peyronie's disease include: medicines to slow down the growth of the hard area on your penis or to treat erectile dysfunction a procedure that uses sound waves to break down the hard area on your penis surgery to straighten your penis (it's not usually possible to straighten it to how it was before it curved) There are also devices that may help. But they need to be used every day for several months and are not usually available on the NHS. Causes of Peyronie's disease The cause of Peyronie's disease is not always known. It can sometimes happen if you injure your penis.

    "title": "Phaeochromocytoma",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/phaeochromocytoma/",
    "text": "Phaeochromocytoma A phaeochromocytoma is a rare tumour of the adrenal glands, which sit above the kidneys. The tumour is mainly found in adults, although children can sometimes develop one. Most do not spread to other areas of the body, but around 1 in 10 do. These are called metastatic phaeochromocytomas. It's usually possible to successfully remove a phaeochromocytoma using surgery. How the tumour affects the adrenal glands The adrenal glands make a number of important hormones, which are released into the bloodstream when needed. These hormones control heart rate, blood pressure and metabolism (the chemical processes that keep your organs working). A phaeochromocytoma can cause the adrenal glands to produce too much of these hormones, which often results in problems such as heart palpitations and high blood pressure . Symptoms of a phaeochromocytoma The symptoms of a phaeochromocytoma tend to be unpredictable, often occurring in sudden attacks lasting from a few minutes to an hour. The attacks may last longer, and become more frequent and severe, as the tumour grows. The symptoms and signs of a phaeochromocytoma can include: headaches heavy sweating heart palpitations high blood pressure a pale face feeling or being sick feeling anxious or panicky shakiness (tremor) Some people with a phaeochromocytoma do not have symptoms, and their condition is either never diagnosed or only discovered during tests for another problem, such as high blood pressure. Others have symptoms for many years before a phaeochromocytoma is diagnosed. Causes of a phaeochromocytoma Many phaeochromocytomas occur for no obvious reason and do not run in the family. However, up to 1 in every 3 occurs as part of an inherited genetic disorder, such as: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) These genetic disorders cause different tumours or growths to develop around the body. If you're diagnosed with a phaeochromocytoma, your doctor may recommend having genetic testing to see if you have any of these disorders. Diagnosing a phaeochromocytoma Diagnosing a phaeochromocytoma can be difficult because the symptoms are quite general and could be caused by many other more common conditions. An adrenal gland tumour is sometimes discovered during a scan for another reason. Further tests to find out more about the tumour may include: blood and urine tests a CT scan an MRI scan Cancer Research UK has more information about the tests and scans that are used to help diagnose a phaeochromocytoma . Treating a phaeochromocytoma Most people with a phaeochromocytoma will need surgery to have it removed. You'll usually be given medicine called alpha blockers (and in some cases beta blockers ) for several weeks before the operation. They block the effects of the excess hormones on your body and stabilise your heart rate and blood pressure. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic (when you're unconscious). It may be done as: \"keyhole\" (laparoscopic) surgery – a number of small cuts (incisions) are made and fine instruments are passed through these to remove the tumour; this is the most common type of surgery for phaeochromocytomas open surgery – a single larger incision is made in the skin to access and remove the tumour The incisions will usually be made in your tummy (abdomen). Your doctor will discuss the best type of operation for you and explain the procedure in detail, including the risks. They'll also answer any questions you have. If your phaeochromocytoma is cancerous, you may need chemotherapy or radiotherapy in addition to surgery. If your tumour cannot be removed, you'll need medicine to manage your condition. This will usually be a combination of medicines to control the effects of the excessive hormones. Outlook Without treatment, phaeochromocytomas can cause severe problems and significantly affect your quality of life. You'll be at risk of an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) , heart attacks , strokes and organ failure. However, most tumours can be successfully removed by surgery and this will usually mean most of the symptoms disappear. In a small number of people, the tumour may come back. You'll therefore need regular check-ups following surgery so that, if it does return, it can be picked up and treated as soon as possible. Contact your GP immediately if your symptoms come back.

    "title": "Phenylketonuria",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/phenylketonuria/",
    "text": "Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare but potentially serious inherited disorder. Our bodies break down the protein in foods, such as meat and fish, into amino acids, which are the \"building blocks\" of protein. These amino acids are then used to make our own proteins. Any amino acids that are not needed are broken down further and removed from the body. People with PKU cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine, which then builds up in their blood and brain. This can lead to brain damage. Diagnosing PKU At around 5 days old, babies are offered newborn blood spot screening to test for PKU and many other conditions. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test. If PKU is confirmed, treatment will be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment includes a special diet and regular blood tests. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, most children with PKU are able to live healthy lives. About 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU. Symptoms of PKU PKU does not usually cause any symptoms if treatment is started early. Without treatment, PKU can damage the brain and nervous system, which can lead to learning disabilities. Other symptoms of untreated PKU include: behavioural difficulties such as frequent temper tantrums and episodes of self-harm fairer skin, hair and eyes than siblings who do not have the condition (phenylalanine is involved in the body's production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair colour) eczema repeatably being sick jerking movements in arms and legs tremors epilepsy musty smell to the breath, skin and urine Treating PKU Diet The main treatment for PKU is a low-protein diet and controlled intake of many other foods, such as potatoes and cereals. High protein foods should be completely avoided. These include: meat and fish eggs and cheese nuts and seeds flour-based foods, like bread, pasta, cakes and biscuits soya, quorn and tofu In addition, people with PKU must take an amino acid supplement to ensure they're getting all the nutrients required for normal growth and good health. There are also several low-protein versions of common foods (such as flour, rice and pasta) specifically designed for people with PKU and related conditions to incorporate into their diets. Many of these are available on prescription. If a high phenylalanine level is confirmed, a baby will immediately be started on a low-protein diet and amino acid supplements. Phenylalanine levels are regularly monitored by collecting blood from a finger prick on to a special card and sending it to a laboratory. A dietitian will create a detailed dietary plan for your child that can be revised as your child grows and their needs change. As long as a person with PKU sticks to a low-protein diet throughout childhood, and their phenylalanine levels stay within certain limits, they'll remain well and their brain function should be unaffected. Aspartame People with PKU must also avoid food products that contain aspartame, as it's converted into phenylalanine in the body. Aspartame is a sweetener found in: sugar substitutes such as the artificial sweeteners often used in tea and coffee diet versions of fizzy drinks chewing gum squash and cordial some alcopops All food products that contain aspartame or a related product should be clearly labelled. There are also medicines that contain aspartame, such as some children's cold and flu remedies. It's a legal requirement for any medicine that contains aspartame to state it on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine. Sapropterin Sapropterin is a medicine that may be used with a low-protein diet to treat a mild form of PKU called hyperphenylalaninaemia. If you have hyperphenylalaninaemia, sapropterin may be recommended if you are: under 22 years of age pregnant an adult likely to respond to treatment (you’ll have a genetic test to find out) It’s thought that sapropterin may help: reduce the level of phenylalanine in the body improve the symptoms of PKU and help protect the brain allow you to eat a less restricted diet get more control of phenylalanine levels than through diet alone But it’s uncertain how well sapropterin works in the long term. If sapropterin is recommended for you, you’ll have regular blood tests to check how well it's working. Regular blood tests A child with phenylketonuria will need regular blood tests to measure levels of phenylalanine in their blood and assess how well they're responding to treatment. Only a drop of blood is needed, and it can be collected at home and sent to the hospital by post. You may be able to have training so you can do your child's blood tests, or be able to test yourself if you have PKU. This will make testing more convenient. It's recommended that children who are: 1 year or younger should have their blood tested once a week between 1 and 12 years should have their blood tested every 2 weeks over 12 years should have their blood tested once a month Someone with PKU will usually need to have regular blood tests throughout their life. How PKU is inherited The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for PKU is passed on by the parents, who are usually carriers and do not have any symptoms of the condition themselves. The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father. If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of PKU. If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has: a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting the condition a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of PKU a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Adults with PKU Many adults with PKU find they function best while on a low-protein diet. The current advice is for people with PKU to remain on a low-protein diet for life. Unlike in young children, there is not yet any evidence that high phenylalanine levels cause any permanent brain damage in adults with PKU. Some adults with PKU may have higher phenylalanine levels because they find it difficult to follow the low-protein diet or have returned to a normal diet. As a result, they may find they do not function as well. For example, they may lose concentration or have a slower reaction time. These adverse effects can usually be reversed by going back on to a strict diet to bring the phenylalanine levels down again. Anyone who returned to a normal diet should still be supported by their clinicians and have a regular follow-up to monitor their condition for any complications that might arise. For women with PKU, it's essential that they return to a strict diet if they're considering becoming pregnant, as high phenylalanine levels can harm an unborn child. PKU and pregnancy Women with PKU must take particular care during pregnancy, as high levels of phenylalanine can damage their unborn baby. Provided that phenylalanine levels are strictly controlled during pregnancy, problems can be avoided and there's no reason why a woman with PKU should not be able to have a normal, healthy baby. It's recommended that all women with PKU plan their pregnancies carefully. You should aim to follow a strict low-protein diet and monitor your blood before becoming pregnant. It's best to try to conceive once phenylalanine levels are within the target range for pregnancy. During pregnancy, you'll be asked to provide blood samples 2 times a week and will be in frequent contact with a dietitian. The medicine, sapropterin, may also be recommended for you during your pregnancy. As soon as your baby is born, phenylalanine control can be relaxed and there's no reason why you cannot breastfeed your baby. Contact your PKU doctor and dietitian as soon as possible if you become pregnant when your phenylalanine levels are not adequately controlled. If your phenylalanine levels can be brought under control within the first few weeks of your pregnancy, the risk of damage to your baby should be small. But your pregnancy will need to be monitored very carefully. Information about you If you or your child has PKU, your clinical team will pass on information about you to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "title": "Tight foreskin (phimosis)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/phimosis/",
    "text": "Tight foreskin (phimosis) It's normal for babies and young boys to have a tight foreskin (phimosis), but adults can also be affected. See a GP if your or your child's foreskin is sore or swollen. Symptoms of a tight foreskin The foreskin is the thin layer of skin that covers the end of the penis. If you or your child has a tight foreskin, it will be difficult to pull it back from the end of the penis. A tight foreskin is normal in babies and young boys. Most boys' foreskins do not pull back (retract) before the age of 5, but sometimes it's not possible until they're 10 or older. The end of a boy's penis may bulge or balloon when they pee, particularly if their foreskin is tight. A tight foreskin is not usually a problem, unless there are symptoms such as: swelling and tenderness pain when peeing or a weak flow of pee blood in urine frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) bleeding or a thick discharge from under the foreskin or an unpleasant smell – these are signs of an infection ( balanitis ) painful erections, which can make having sex difficult Things you can do if you have a tight foreskin If your or your child's foreskin is tight, but is not causing problems like pain or bleeding, there are some things you can do to help ease it and keep the penis clean. Do wash your penis regularly – use warm water or warm water and non-perfumed soap gently pull back your foreskin as far as you can, so you can clean underneath it (adults only) Don’t do not pull back the foreskin of a baby or young boy because it could be painful and damage it, leading to problems in later life do not use perfumed soap, talcum powder or deodorants on your penis because they may cause irritation Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your or your child's foreskin is tight and swollen or painful there's bleeding around your or your child's foreskin when peeing, a thick discharge from under the foreskin, or an unpleasant smell Treatments for a tight foreskin The foreskins of babies and young boys will usually loosen as they get older, so treatment is often not needed. If your or your child's foreskin is causing problems, treatments include: steroid creams or gels ( topical steroids ) to help soften the foreskin antibiotics if the foreskin or head of the penis is infected surgery – removal of the foreskin (circumcision) or a procedure where small cuts are made in the tip of the foreskin so it can be pulled back more easily (usually only suitable for children) Information: Find out more Circumcision in boys Circumcision in men British Association of Urological Surgeons: phimosis and phimosis treatments Complications of a tight foreskin Sometimes if the foreskin is very tight it can get stuck and cannot go back to its original position covering the end of the penis. The end of the penis can then become very swollen and painful. This is known as paraphimosis and it's a medical emergency. Immediate treatment is needed to avoid serious complications like restricted blood flow to the penis. A doctor may be able to return the foreskin to its original position. Sometimes surgery to remove the foreskin (circumcision) may be recommended. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you or your child's foreskin is pulled back and cannot go back to its original position over the end of the penis Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Page last reviewed: 11 April 2022 Next review due: 11 April 2025"

Symptoms of an infected pilonidal sinus Most people with a pilonidal sinus do not notice it unless it becomes infected and causes symptoms. An infection will cause pain and swelling at the top of the cleft in your buttocks, and a pus-filled skin abscess can develop. Sometimes a pus-filled abscess can develop suddenly, causing pain and swelling, and making it difficult to sit down. If you keep getting infections you may have ongoing problems, like discomfort or pain, and regularly seeping pus or blood. See what an infected pilonidal sinus looks like An infected pilonidal sinus is painful and swollen and may bleed or leak pus. Credit: GIRAND/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/127112/view Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or contact NHS 111 if: you have a small lump at the top of your bottom (between your buttocks) that's painful, bleeding or leaking pus These symptoms can develop quickly, often over a few days. They're signs of infection and need to be treated. A pilonidal sinus that's not infected Treatment is not needed for a pilonidal sinus if there are no signs of infection. A \"watch and wait\" approach will be recommended. It's very important to keep the area between your buttocks clean by showering or bathing regularly. Do not shave the affected area unless a GP advises you to. Treatments for an infected pilonidal sinus Treatment for an infected pilonidal sinus will depend on: your symptoms the size of the pilonidal sinus whether it's your first infected pilonidal sinus or it keeps coming back If you have a painful, swollen abscess, it usually needs to be cut and the pus drained. You may also need antibiotics . There are a number of treatment options for a pilonidal sinus that keeps coming back and that's painful, bleeding or leaking discharge. Your doctor will discuss these with you. In most cases you'll be offered painkillers, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , to help reduce pain and swelling. Minor operation to drain pus from sinus Incision and drainage This is a procedure for an infected abscess. A small cut (hole) is made in the abscess so the pus can be drained. This is usually arranged on the same day as you see your GP. You'll have a local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic , depending on the size of the abscess. It will usually be done at a hospital (you can leave the same day) or can sometimes be done at your GP surgery. You may need a course of antibiotics. You'll need to have regular (daily) dressing changes. Surgery to remove sinus (wound left open) Wide excision and open healing You may need surgery for a large or repeatedly infected sinus. The sinus is cut out and some surrounding skin removed. The wound is left open to heal naturally. You'll have a local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic . It will be done in hospital and you can usually leave the same day. You'll need to have regular dressing changes. This surgery gives you the lowest risk of a pilonidal sinus coming back. Surgery to remove sinus (wound closed) Excision and wound closure This surgery is for a large or repeatedly infected pilonidal sinus. The sinus is removed and an oval-shaped flap of skin cut out on either side of it. The 2 sides are then stitched together. You'll have a local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic . It will be done in hospital and you can usually leave the same day. Your stitches will be removed about 10 days after the operation. This surgery gives you a quicker recovery time than wide excision and open healing. There is a higher risk of infection – the wound may need to be opened and dressings changed regularly. Procedure to clean sinus and encourage healing Endoscopic ablation for a pilonidal sinus This procedure is to clean a pilonidal sinus and encourage healing. An endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end) is used to give a clear view of the affected area. Hair and infected tissue are removed, and the sinus is cleaned with a special solution. Heat is used to seal the sinus. You'll have a spinal or local anaesthetic . It will be done in hospital and you can usually leave the same day. This procedure is less invasive than surgery as no cut is needed. It has a good success rate with a low risk of complications. The recovery time is about a month to completely heal, but it can be quicker. Other treatments Plastic surgery is sometimes used if the area being treated is particularly large. The sinus is removed and the surrounding skin reconstructed. Less invasive procedures to close the sinus, like injection with fibrin glue, may be available in some places. Follow-up You may have a follow-up appointment with your specialist after your surgery. This is usually about 6 weeks later, but may be slightly longer. Your care team will advise you about how to care for your wound while it heals and what to do if symptoms come back. What to do after your operation Do keep the affected area clean wear comfortable, loose-fitting cotton underwear eat plenty of fibre to make going to the toilet easier and avoid straining Don’t do not lift heavy objects or do strenuous exercise for the first week or so do not ride a bike for 6 to 8 weeks do not go swimming until your wound has completely healed Going back to work How soon you can return to work depends on: the procedure you had how quickly you recover the type of job you do Most people are able to return to work within 2 weeks of surgery. Your surgeon will be able to give you more advice about your recovery. Causes of pilonidal sinus It's not clear what causes a pilonidal sinus. A skin problem, pressure or friction may cause hair between the buttocks to be pushed inwards. This may either be hair growing around the buttock area, or loose hair shed from the buttocks or elsewhere that gathers around the buttock cleft and enters the pilonidal sinus. Pilonidal sinuses are more common in men because they tend to be hairier. Sitting for long periods can also increase your chances of getting a pilonidal sinus.

    "title": "PIP breast implants",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pip-implants/",
    "text": "PIP breast implants PIP breast implants were withdrawn from the UK in 2010 after it was found they had been fraudulently manufactured with unapproved silicone gel, and were far more prone to splitting (rupturing) than other breast implants. Research hasn't found any evidence to suggest that PIP implants pose a serious health risk, but they can cause unpleasant symptoms if they rupture and you may be anxious about leaving them in. If you have PIP implants, you should discuss with a surgeon whether they should be taken out. The implants don't necessarily need to be removed, but they should be taken out if they rupture or you're worried about this happening. What are PIP implants? PIP implants are silicone breast implants containing unapproved silicone gel. They were manufactured in France by a company called Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP). The concerns relate to all breast implants manufactured by PIP. It's estimated around 47,000 British women had PIP implants fitted, most of whom are still living with them. The vast majority of PIP implants were fitted in private clinics, but a small number were done on the NHS, mostly for breast reconstruction after breast cancer . Risks of PIP implants PIP implants are 2 to 6 times more likely to rupture than standard silicone implants. This doesn't pose a serious risk to your health, but it can cause some unpleasant symptoms. See your GP if you have signs of a rupture, such as: lumpiness or swelling in and around the breast a change in the shape of the breast redness – this may be harder to see on black or brown skin pain and tenderness a burning sensation enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit Ruptured PIP implants have no proven long-term health effects. British and European researchers have so far not found any evidence to suggest that the ingredients in the implants can cause cancer or are toxic. Find further information at: GOV.UK: Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) breast implants: final report European Commission: Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR): preliminary opinion on the safety of Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) silicone breast implants How to find out if you have PIP implants You may have been given details about your breast implants when they were fitted. This will often include information about the manufacturer of your implants. If you don't have these details, you can ask for them from the clinic or hospital where the implants were fitted. The medical notes kept by your GP may also include this information. Most women who had PIP implants fitted on the NHS should already have received a letter telling them about it and advising them what to do. What to do if you have PIP implants You should get medical advice if you have PIP implants. If the implants were fitted on the NHS, your GP can arrange for you to see an NHS specialist. If they were fitted privately, contact the clinic. If they were fitted privately and the clinic is unable or unwilling to help, speak to your GP about seeing an NHS specialist. You should have an ultrasound scan or MRI scan to check whether your implants have ruptured. A ruptured implant should be removed as soon as possible. If there are no signs of a rupture, talk to your surgeon about the benefits and risks of taking the implants out or leaving them in. If you're concerned about leaving them in, removing them will usually be recommended. If you decide to keep them in, you should look out for signs of a rupture and have a yearly check-up with your doctor to make sure the implants are still intact. Removing and replacing PIP implants Some private clinics have agreed to remove and replace PIP breast implants free of charge, while others charge a fee. If the clinic where you had your implants fitted won't help you because it has closed or is unwilling to do so, you may be able to have your implants removed free of charge on the NHS. However, the NHS in England won't provide replacement implants if your original implants were fitted privately, except in a very small number of cases where they were fitted for medical, rather than cosmetic, reasons. If you had PIP breast implants originally fitted on the NHS, you may be able to have them removed and replaced by the NHS at no cost. The operation to remove and replace PIP implants is done wherever possible through the original surgical cuts. Page last reviewed: 01 December 2022 Next review due: 01 December 2025"

Symptoms of pityriasis rosea The main symptom of pityriasis rosea is a rash. Some people get flu-like symptoms a few days before the rash appears, including: tiredness a sore throat a high temperature a headache The rash appears in 2 stages. Stage 1: single, round patch The first stage of the rash is a single, scaly patch called a herald patch. The herald patch is usually oval or round, slightly raised and about 2cm to 5cm across. It usually appears on the chest, thigh, upper arm or neck, but you can get it anywhere on the body. On white skin, the herald patch is usually pink with a red border.

Urgent advice: Call your midwife, maternity unit, GP or NHS 111 immediately if: you have a new rash and you're pregnant Getting pityriasis rosea in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy has been linked with miscarriage and premature birth. Treatment for pityriasis rosea Pityriasis rosea usually gets better on its own within a few months without any treatment. It might get worse before it goes away completely. If the rash is uncomfortable or itchy, a pharmacist might advise: using an emollient (moisturising treatment for the skin) on the rash taking antihistamine tablets to help with the itching avoiding using soaps and body washes A pharmacist will tell you how often to take or apply any treatments. If these treatments do not work or if you have severe pityriasis rosea, your GP may recommend steroid cream or refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist). Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have a rash that's still itchy after trying pharmacy treatments like emollients or antihistamines you have a rash that has not gone away after 3 months How you get pityriasis rosea The exact cause of pityriasis rosea is not known.

Symptoms of pityriasis versicolor Pityriasis versicolor causes patches of skin to change colour. On white skin, the patches are usually pink, red or pale brown. You may notice the patches do not tan in the sun. On brown or black skin, the patches tend to be paler than the surrounding skin.

The main treatments are: antifungal shampoo (such as ketoconazole ) that you use on the affected skin and rinse off after a few minutes antifungal cream If pityriasis versicolor covers a large area, or shampoos and creams do not work, a GP may prescribe antifungal tablets. It can take a few months for the skin to return to its usual colour after treatment and the patches can come back. If they come back, you may need the same treatment again or your GP may suggest long-term treatment such as using antifungal shampoo every few weeks.

    "title": "Plagiocephaly and brachycephaly (flat head syndrome)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/plagiocephaly-brachycephaly/",
    "text": "Plagiocephaly and brachycephaly (flat head syndrome) Babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they're a few months old, usually as a result of them spending a lot of time lying on their back. This is known as flat head syndrome, and there are 2 main types: plagiocephaly – the head is flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical; the ears may be misaligned and the head looks like a parallelogram when seen from above, and sometimes the forehead and face may bulge a little on the flat side brachycephaly – the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen, and occasionally the forehead bulges out Credit: Created by NHSD (Annabel King) These problems are quite common, affecting around 1 in every 5 babies at some point. In most cases they are not a major cause for concern, as they do not have any effect on the brain and the head shape will often improve by itself over time. Your baby will not experience any pain or other symptoms, or any problems with their general development. What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly? The skull is made up of plates of bone that strengthen and join together as a child gets older. A young baby's skull is still relatively soft and can change shape if there's constant pressure on a particular part of their head. Reasons why this may happen include: sleeping on their back – the back or side of a baby's head can become flattened as a result of always sleeping on their back, but it's important they do this to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) problems in the womb – pressure can be placed on a baby's head before they're born if they're a bit squashed in the womb or there's a lack of amniotic fluid to cushion them being born prematurely – premature babies are more likely to develop a flattened head because their skull is softer when they're born, and they may prefer to rest their head on one side at first as they're not yet able to move their head themselves neck muscle tightness – this can prevent a baby turning their head a particular way, meaning one side of their head is placed under more pressure Occasionally, a flattened head can be caused by the plates of the skull joining together too early. This is known as craniosynostosis . When to get medical advice Speak to your health visitor or GP if you're concerned about the shape of your baby's head or think they may have problems turning their head. They can examine your baby's head and suggest things you can do to help. A slightly flattened head is not usually anything to worry about, but it's a good idea to get advice early on so you can take steps to stop it getting any worse. What you can do The shape of your baby's head should improve naturally over time as their skull develops and they start moving their head, rolling around and crawling. To take pressure off the flattened part of your baby's head: give your baby time on their tummy during the day – encourage them to try new positions during play time, but make sure they always sleep on their back as this is safest for them switch your baby between a sloping chair, a sling and a flat surface – this ensures there is not constant pressure on one part of their head change the position of toys and mobiles in their cot – this will encourage your baby to turn their head on to the non-flattened side alternate the side you hold your baby when feeding and carrying reduce the time your baby spends lying on a firm flat surface, such as car seats and prams – try using a sling or front carrier when practical If your baby has difficulty turning their head, physiotherapy may help loosen and strengthen their neck muscles. Corrective surgery may be needed if they have craniosynostosis. Find out more about how craniosynostosis is treated Helmets, headbands and mattresses There are specially designed helmets and headbands that some people claim can help improve the shape of a baby's skull as they grow. These devices apply pressure to \"bulging\" parts of the skull and relieve pressure from other parts, potentially allowing growth in the flatter areas. Treatment is started when the child's skull is still soft, usually at around 5 or 6 months old, and the device is worn almost continuously (up to 23 hours a day) for several months. But these helmets and headbands generally are not recommended because: there is not clear evidence to suggest they work they often cause problems such as skin irritation and rashes they're expensive, typically costing around £2,000 your baby will need to be checked every few weeks to monitor their head growth and make any necessary adjustments they may be uncomfortable and distressing for your baby Some people try special curved mattresses that are designed to distribute the weight of a baby's head over a larger area so less pressure is placed on a particular point of their skull. These are cheaper than helmets and headbands, but there's currently only limited evidence to suggest they may help. Will my child's head shape return to normal? Mild flattening of the head will usually improve if you use the simple measures described on this page, although it may be a couple of months before you start to notice an improvement. Your baby's head may not return to a completely perfect shape, but by the time they're 1 or 2 years old any flattening will be barely noticeable. More severe cases will also get better over time, although some flattening will usually remain. The appearance of your child's head should improve as they become more mobile and their hair grows. It's very rare for a child to experience problems such as teasing when they reach school age. You may consider using a helmet or headband if you're worried about your child, but it's not clear whether these always work. You should also bear in mind the inconvenience, expense and possible discomfort for you and your child. Page last reviewed: 03 August 2022 Next review due: 03 August 2025"

Credit: NHSD/Rich Kelly/Turbosquid It's more likely to be plantar fasciitis if: the pain is much worse when you first start walking after sleeping or resting the pain gradually gets better when you start moving around, but gets worse if you stand, walk or run for a long time it's painful to stretch the bottom of your foot, for example when you raise your toes off the floor or walk up stairs How to ease plantar fasciitis yourself If you see a GP for plantar fasciitis, they'll usually suggest you try these things: Do rest and raise your foot on a stool when you can put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a towel on the painful area for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours wear shoes with cushioned heels and good arch support use insoles or heel pads in your shoes try regular gentle exercises to stretch the sole of your foot and your heel try exercises that do not put pressure on your feet, such as swimming take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen gel, or ibuprofen tablets if you need them try to lose weight if you're overweight Don’t do not walk or stand for long periods do not wear high heels or tight pointy shoes do not wear flip-flops or backless slippers try not to walk barefoot on hard surfaces A pharmacist can help with plantar fasciitis You can ask a pharmacist about: the best painkiller to take insoles and pads for your shoes if you need to see a GP Find a pharmacy Information: Find out more about pain in the bottom of the foot, including videos of exercises that can help . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have pain in the bottom of your foot that is severe or stopping you doing normal activities your foot pain is getting worse or keeps coming back your foot pain has not improved after treating it yourself for 2 weeks you have any tingling or loss of feeling in your foot you have diabetes and foot pain – foot problems can be more serious if you have diabetes Treatment for plantar fasciitis from a foot specialist If plantar fasciitis does not get better, a GP might refer you to a physiotherapist or foot specialist (podiatrist). A physiotherapist can show you exercises to help ease your symptoms. A podiatrist can recommend things like insoles and the right shoes to wear, or splints to wear at night. If these things do not help, a specialist may offer other treatments such as steroid injections, or using a machine to deliver high-energy sound waves to your foot (extracorporeal shock-wave therapy). Less commonly you may be offered surgery. Physiotherapy is available free of charge on the NHS throughout the UK but waiting times for accessing physiotherapy can sometimes be long. Podiatry may not be available for free on the NHS everywhere and waiting times can sometimes be long. You can also pay to see a podiatrist or physiotherapist privately. Find a registered podiatrist Find a registered physiotherapist Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have plantar fasciitis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS treatment for plantar fasciitis near you Common causes of plantar fasciitis Plantar fasciitis is caused by straining the part of your foot that connects your heel bone to your toes (plantar fascia). It's not always clear why this happens. Plantar fasciitis is common. You may be more likely to get it if you: are 40 to 60 years of age recently started exercising on hard surfaces exercise with a tight calf or heel overstretch the sole of your foot during exercise do a lot of standing, walking or running, or started doing a lot more than is usual for you wear shoes with poor cushioning or support are overweight Page last reviewed: 14 February 2025 Next review due: 14 February 2028"

    "text": "Polio Polio is a serious infection that's now very rare because of the vaccination programme. It's only found in a few countries and the chance of getting it in the UK is extremely low. Polio in the UK There have been no confirmed cases of paralysis due to polio caught in the UK since 1984. Although some poliovirus has been found in sewage from London recently, the risk of getting it remains extremely low. The chance of getting ill from polio is higher if you are not fully vaccinated, so it's important to make sure you, and your child, are up to date with your vaccines. Washing your hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser regularly throughout the day also helps you avoid catching and spreading viruses. Polio vaccination The best way to prevent polio is to make sure you and your child are up to date with your vaccinations. The polio vaccine is part of the NHS routine childhood vaccination schedule . The polio vaccine is given to children at: 8, 12 and 16 weeks old as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine 3 years, 4 months old as part of the 4-in-1 (DTaP/IPV) pre-school booster 14 years old as part of the 3-in-1 (Td/IPV) teenage booster You need all 5 of these vaccinations to be fully vaccinated against polio. You can contact your GP surgery to check if you, or your child, are up to date with your polio vaccinations. For children and babies, you can also check their personal child health record (red book). If you are not up to date, book an appointment with your GP surgery to get vaccinated free on the NHS. Information: You can have a polio vaccination at any point if you've never had one before, even if you're not travelling to a country with a risk of getting polio. You should also get vaccinated even if you've had polio before as it protects against different types of polio. Important: Polio and MMR vaccinations in London From May 2023, children aged 1 to 11 in London who are not up to date with their routine vaccinations are being offered polio and MMR vaccinations through GP surgeries, primary schools and community clinics. Find out more about the London polio and MMR vaccinations Check before you travel If you're travelling abroad, get advice from a travel clinic, GP, nurse or pharmacist before you go. In addition to the routine polio vaccines, you may need a polio booster vaccination before you travel. Some countries require proof of vaccination (an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, or ICVP) before you can enter or leave. How polio is spread Polio is caused by a virus that spreads easily from person to person. It usually spreads through contact with the poo of an infected person. For example, from not washing your hands properly and putting them in your mouth, or from contaminated food or water. It can also spread through coughs or sneezes, but this is less common. Your chance of getting polio in the UK is extremely low. This is because most people are fully vaccinated. Polio was eradicated in Europe in 2003. There's still an extremely small risk of catching it when travelling in a country where polio is still found, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. If you're not vaccinated, there is also a very small risk of getting it through contact with a person bringing the polio virus from these countries when they return to the UK. Information: Check the risks of a country you're travelling to on the TravelHealthPro website Symptoms of polio Most people who get polio do not have symptoms. Some people get mild, flu-like symptoms, such as: a high temperature extreme tiredness (fatigue) headaches being sick (vomiting) a stiff neck muscle pain These symptoms usually last up to 10 days. Rarely, polio can lead to more serious symptoms that affect the brain and nerves, such as weakness in your muscles (paralysis), usually in the legs. This can happen over hours or days. If the paralysis affects the muscles used for breathing, it can be life threatening. Most people will recover, and movement will slowly come back over the next few weeks. Some people can be left with permanent disability. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if you or your child: are not able to move part, or all, of your body – the body part may also feel stiff, floppy or numb are having difficulty breathing or are breathless Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Urgent advice: Get advice from 111 now if: You have flu-like symptoms and: you're worried about a baby's or child's symptoms you're 65 or over you're pregnant you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes or a heart, lung, kidney or neurological disease you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of chemotherapy or HIV your symptoms do not improve after 7 days Check your symptoms on 111 online or call 111. Treatments for polio There is no treatment for polio, but some types of care will help lower the risk of long-term problems. This can include: bed rest in hospital painkillers help with breathing regular stretches and exercises to prevent problems with your muscles and joints You may need to have specialist help such as physiotherapy or surgery if you have any long-term problems caused by polio. Complications of polio Polio can cause long-term or lifelong difficulties. Some people may be permanently paralysed, and others may have problems that need long-term treatment and support. This can include: muscle weakness problems with your joints swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) If you've had polio before, you may develop symptoms again or your symptoms may get worse, sometimes decades later. This is called post-polio syndrome . Page last reviewed: 16 September 2022 Next review due: 23 May 2025"

    "text": "Overview - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Complications Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children affected by ADPKD are born with the condition, it rarely causes any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this does not occur until a person is between 30 and 40 years of age. Less commonly, children or older people may have noticeable symptoms as a result of ADPKD. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including: tummy (abdominal) pain high blood pressure (hypertension) blood in the urine (haematuria) , which may not always be noticeable to the naked eye potentially serious upper urinary tract infections (UTIs) kidney stones Kidney function may gradually deteriorate until so much is lost that kidney failure occurs. Read more about the symptoms of ADPKD and diagnosing ADPKD . What causes ADPKD ADPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts the normal development of some of the cells in the kidneys and causes cysts to grow. Faults in 1 of 2 different genes are known to cause ADPKD. The affected genes are: PKD1, which accounts for around 78% of cases PKD2, which accounts for around 15% of cases Both types of ADPKD have the same symptoms, but they tend to be more severe in PKD1. A child has a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of developing ADPKD if one of their parents has the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rarer type of kidney disease that can only be inherited if both parents carry the faulty gene. In this type problems usually start much earlier, during childhood. Non-inherited ADPKD In up to 1 in 4 (25%) cases, a person develops ADPKD without having a known family history of the condition. This could be because the condition was never diagnosed in a relative, or a relative with the condition may have died before their symptoms were recognised. In around 1 in 10 cases of ADPKD, the mutation develops for the first time in the affected person. It's not known what causes this to happen. The affected person can pass the faulty gene on to their children in the same way as someone who's inherited it from a parent. Who's affected ADPKD is the most common inherited condition to affect the kidneys, although it's still relatively uncommon. It's estimated up to 1 in every 1000 to 2500 people in the UK has ADPKD. This means there could be between 30,000 and 70,000 people in the UK with the condition. Treating ADPKD There's currently no cure for ADPKD, however: a healthy lifestyle may help to protect your kidney function various treatments are available to manage problems caused by the condition Most problems, such as high blood pressure, pain and UTIs, can be treated with medication, although you may need to have an operation to remove any large kidney stones that develop. If the condition reaches a point where the kidneys are not able to function properly, there are 2 main treatment options: dialysis , where a machine is used to replicate kidney functions a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure A medication called tolvaptan can be used to slow down the formation of cysts and protect kidney function. Find out more about treating ADPKD Outlook The outlook for ADPKD is highly variable. Some people experience kidney failure soon after the condition is diagnosed, whereas others may live the rest of their life with their kidneys working relatively well. On average, around half of people with ADPKD require treatment for kidney failure by the time they're 60. As well as kidney failure, ADPKD can also cause a number of other potentially serious problems, such as heart attacks and strokes caused by high blood pressure, or bleeding on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) caused by a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain (brain aneurysm) . Find out more about the complications of ADPKD Information about you If you have ADPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood and pass them out of the body in urine.

    "text": "Overview - Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare inherited childhood condition where the development of the kidneys and liver is abnormal. Over time, these organs may fail. The condition often causes serious problems soon after birth, although less severe cases may not become obvious until a child is older. ARPKD can cause a wide range of problems, including: underdeveloped lungs, which can cause severe breathing difficulties soon after birth high blood pressure (hypertension) excessive peeing and thirst problems with blood flow through the liver, which can lead to serious internal bleeding a progressive loss of kidney function, known as chronic kidney disease (CKD) When these problems develop and how severe they are can vary considerably, even between family members with the condition. Read more about the symptoms of ARPKD and diagnosing ARPKD . Even though ARPKD is rare, it's one of the most common kidney problems to affect young children. It's estimated around 1 in 20,000 babies is born with the condition. Both boys and girls are affected equally. The kidneys The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just beneath the rib cage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood before passing them out of the body as urine. The kidneys also help maintain blood pressure at a healthy level. What causes ARPKD? ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver. In particular, the growth and development of the small tubes that make up the kidneys is affected, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to develop within them. Over time, the cysts cause the kidneys to become enlarged and scarred (fibrosis), resulting in the deterioration of overall kidney function. Similar problems also affect the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow a digestive fluid called bile to flow out of the liver. The bile ducts may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. The liver can also become scarred over time. ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents. If both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have developing ARPKD. The way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) , which usually does not cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood. Sometimes ADPKD can happen when only one parent has passed on a faulty gene, but this is rare. Find out more about the causes of ARPKD Treating ARPKD There's currently no cure for ARPKD, but various treatments can help manage the wide range of problems it can cause. Treatment for ARPKD may include: breathing assistance with a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs (a ventilator) for children with severe breathing difficulties medication to treat high blood pressure procedures to stop any internal bleeding that may occur medications to control problems associated with the loss of kidney function, such as iron supplements for anaemia If kidney failure does occur, there are 2 main treatment options: dialysis , where a machine is used to replicate many functions of the kidney a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure Find out more about how ARPKD is treated Outlook The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary considerably depending on the severity of the condition. If routine scans pick up kidney problems during pregnancy, the baby will usually have a poorer outlook than a child who's diagnosed at a later stage. But in general, ARPKD is a severe condition and around 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties during the first 4 weeks after birth. About 9 out of 10 babies with ARPKD who survive the first month of life will live until they're at least 5 years old. It's difficult to predict exactly how long a child with ARPKD will live because there's very little data showing long-term survival rates. But with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood. Information about you If you have ARPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).

The 3 main features of PCOS are: irregular periods – which means your ovaries do not regularly release eggs (ovulation) excess androgen – high levels of \"male\" hormones in your body, which may cause physical signs such as excess facial or body hair polycystic ovaries – your ovaries become enlarged and contain many fluid-filled sacs (follicles) that surround the eggs (but despite the name, you do not actually have cysts if you have PCOS) If you have at least 2 of these features, you may be diagnosed with PCOS. Polycystic ovaries Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles that are up to 8mm (approximately 0.3in) in size. The follicles are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. In PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation does not take place. It's difficult to know exactly how many women have PCOS, but it's thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK. More than half of these women do not have any symptoms. Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) If you have signs and symptoms of PCOS , they'll usually become apparent during your late teens or early 20s. They can include: irregular periods or no periods at all difficulty getting pregnant as a result of irregular ovulation or no ovulation excessive hair growth (hirsutism) – usually on the face, chest, back or buttocks weight gain thinning hair and hair loss from the head oily skin or acne PCOS is also associated with an increased risk of developing health problems in later life, such as type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol levels. What causes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families. It's related to abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body. Many women with PCOS are resistant to the action of insulin in their body and produce higher levels of insulin to overcome this. This contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones like testosterone. Being overweight or obese also increases the amount of insulin your body produces. Treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) There's no cure for PCOS, but the symptoms can be treated. Speak to a GP if you think you may have the condition. If you have PCOS and you're overweight, losing weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet can make some symptoms better. Medicines are also available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems. If fertility medicines are not effective, a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended. This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens, such as testosterone. With treatment, most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant.

    "text": "Polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid) Polyhydramnios is when there's too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb) during pregnancy. It's not usually serious and there's often no cause. Symptoms of polyhydramnios Polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid) does not usually cause symptoms. You may only find out you have it at a routine scan or antenatal appointment. If you do have symptoms, they might include: indigestion and heartburn constipation breathlessness swollen feet and legs urinary tract infections (UTIs) These could also be usual symptoms in pregnancy . Polyhydramnios can happen suddenly if the amniotic fluid increases quickly. It can cause tummy pain and make your tummy get bigger suddenly. This is more common if you're expecting more than 1 baby. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment, contact your midwife, or get help from NHS 111 if: your tummy gets bigger suddenly you have tummy pain You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . How polyhydramnios is diagnosed If you do not have symptoms of polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid), you may only find out you have it at a routine appointment. The person doing your ultrasound scan (a sonographer) may see the extra fluid, or your midwife may notice at a check-up because you'll be larger than expected for your due date. It may be harder to hear the baby's heartbeat at your appointments because of the extra fluid. If you have symptoms of polyhydramnios, such as your tummy getting bigger suddenly, you may be referred for an ultrasound scan. A sonographer will measure the amount of amniotic fluid around the baby. How you get polyhydramnios The cause of polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid) is often unknown. Some possible causes include: diabetes during pregnancy ( gestational diabetes ) being pregnant with more than 1 baby an infection during pregnancy a problem with your baby swallowing your baby having a genetic condition Treatments for polyhydramnios Polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid) usually does not need any treatment. You may have extra check-ups for the rest of your pregnancy and during labour and birth. If the polyhydramnios is caused by a condition such as gestational diabetes , you'll be treated for the condition. If you have severe polyhydramnios, you may have some of the amniotic fluid drained from your womb using a thin needle. You may need this treatment more than once. You'll be monitored afterwards to check your fluid levels. Complications of polyhydramnios Complications of polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid) are rare. Rarely, in more severe cases, complications can include: your waters breaking early – call your midwife straight away if this happens placental abruption, where the placenta separates from the womb before the baby is born umbilical cord prolapse, where the umbilical cord slips down in front of the baby after your waters have broken your baby being born prematurely your baby having a low birth weight Your labour and birth plan If you have moderate or severe polyhydramnios, you may be advised to give birth in hospital. This is so you can be monitored closely and treatment will be available quickly if needed. You may have a higher chance of needing a caesarean section to avoid any problems. Speak to your midwife if you have any concerns about your plans for labour and birth. Page last reviewed: 18 April 2024 Next review due: 18 April 2027"

It usually goes away on its own if you stay out of the sun, but it can keep coming back. Symptoms of polymorphic light eruption The main symptom of polymorphic light eruption is a rash on the skin. It usually appears within a few hours or days of going in the sun, and is more common in spring and summer. The rash may: have small raised spots or blisters have larger blotchy areas be itchy or feel like it's burning be red or pink – this may be harder to see on brown or black skin The rash can appear anywhere on the body, but is often in places that are not regularly exposed to the sun, such as the arms, legs or chest. A similar type of rash on the ears can cause small blisters that may be itchy or uncomfortable. This is called juvenile spring eruption.

Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica The main symptom is muscle stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes. Other symptoms may include: extreme tiredness loss of appetite weight loss depression See a GP if you have pain and stiffness for more than a week. They'll try to find out what's causing it. Diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica can be difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis . These conditions will need to be ruled out before polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosed. Causes of polymyalgia rheumatica The cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an age-related condition. Most people diagnosed with it are over 65, and it's very rare in people younger than 50. It's also more common in women than men. Treating polymyalgia rheumatica A steroid medicine called prednisolone is the main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica. It's used to help relieve the symptoms. To start with, you may be prescribed a moderate dose of prednisolone, which will be gradually reduced over time. Most people with polymyalgia rheumatica will need a course of steroid treatment that lasts for 12 months to 2 years to prevent their symptoms returning. Temporal arteritis Up to 1 in 5 people with polymyalgia rheumatica develop a more serious condition called temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis), where the arteries in the head and neck become inflamed. Symptoms of temporal arteritis can include: a new or frequent headache that usually develops suddenly (your scalp may also feel sore or tender) pain in the jaw muscles or tongue when eating or talking problems with sight, such as double vision or loss of vision in 1 or both eyes If you have any of these symptoms, contact a GP immediately, go to 111.nhs.uk or call NHS 111 .

Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you have pompholyx you have pompholyx and the blisters are very painful, leak yellow or green pus or are covered in a yellow-brown crust – these are signs of an infection you have any other changes to your skin you're worried about Treatments for pompholyx Pompholyx is usually a long-term condition that comes and goes over time. Treatment can help control the symptoms. The main treatments for pompholyx are: moisturisers ( emollients ) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry steroid creams and ointments ( topical steroids ) – used for a few weeks at a time to reduce irritation and soreness If the blisters leak fluid, a GP may suggest soaking your skin in potassium permanganate solution. This helps dry the blisters and reduces the risk of them getting infected. If the blisters become infected, a GP may prescribe antibiotics. Treatments from a specialist If your symptoms are severe or treatment is not helping, a GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist). A dermatologist may recommend other treatments, such as: steroid tablets treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light other medicines, such as alitretinoin Things you can do to ease symptoms of pompholyx If you have pompholyx, your skin may get irritated easily. There are some things you can try to see if they help.

A Baker's cyst on a leg Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/429776/view It's caused when the tissue behind the knee joint becomes swollen and inflamed. The swelling and inflammation can cause: pain in the knee and calf a build-up of fluid around the knee occasional locking or clicking in the knee joint However, sometimes a Baker's cyst may not cause any symptoms other than the fluid-filled swelling at the back of the knee. A Baker's cyst can sometimes burst (rupture), resulting in fluid leaking down into your calf. This can cause sharp pain, swelling and redness in your calf, but redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin. What causes a Baker's cyst? Knee damage caused by a sports injury or a blow to the knee can lead to a Baker's cyst developing. A Baker's cyst can also sometimes occur if you have a health condition such as: osteoarthritis – usually caused by age-related \"wear and tear\" of joints; it particularly affects the knees, hips, hands and big toe inflammatory arthritis – including rheumatoid arthritis , which is a less common type of arthritis and is caused by the immune system attacking the joints gout – a type of arthritis that usually affects the big toe and is caused by a build-up of the waste product uric acid in the blood Baker's cysts usually develop in people aged 30 to 70, although they can affect people of any age, including children. When to see your GP See your GP if you have a lump behind your knee that's causing problems and does not clear up on its own. They'll usually be able to diagnose a Baker's cyst by examining the back of your knee and asking about your symptoms. Your GP will ask you whether you have any associated health conditions, such as arthritis . Tests may be recommended to rule out other more serious conditions, such as a tumour, an aneurysm (bulge in a section of a blood vessel) or DVT (deep vein thrombosis) (a blood clot in one of the deep veins of the body). You may need an ultrasound scan or a MRI scan . Treating a Baker's cyst Treatment will not usually be necessary if you have a Baker's cyst that is not causing any symptoms. Painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be used to reduce the swelling and relieve any pain. A knee support or an ice pack may also help. A bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well as an ice pack. If you have an underlying condition that's causing your cyst, it's important that the condition is properly managed. The cyst may disappear when the condition causing it has been treated. In some cases, it may be possible to drain the cyst. Surgery may also be needed to repair any significant damage around the knee joint. Read more about treating a Baker's cyst .

Symptoms of post-herpetic neuralgia Post-herpetic neuralgia is common after you've had shingles . It affects the areas of your body where you had the shingles rash. The symptoms usually start while you have the shingles rash or soon after it gets better. In rare cases symptoms start a few weeks or months after the shingles rash has gone. Symptoms of post-herpetic neuralgia may include: aching, burning or sharp pain in your skin that may be constant or come and go skin that's very sensitive to pain – you may have pain from slight touch or pressure, or from changes in temperature itchy skin loss of feeling in your skin The pain is often mild, but some people have severe pain. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you've had shingles and you get pain that does not get better where you had the shingles rash Treatments for post-herpetic neuralgia Post-herpetic neuralgia can be difficult to treat. It usually gets better eventually, but how long this takes can vary from a few months to over a year. A GP will usually prescribe medicines to help with pain, such as: paracetamol , or paracetamol with codeine , if you have mild or moderate pain – this helps some people but it's unlikely to completely relieve your pain medicine to treat nerve pain, such as amitriptyline , duloxetine , gabapentin or pregabalin , if paracetamol and codeine have not worked plasters containing lidocaine (a local anaesthetic), if you have mild pain or other medicines are not suitable for you tramadol , if you have severe pain – you can usually only take this for a short time Medicines for nerve pain may not work straight away. You'll usually start on a low dose that will be increased gradually over a few weeks. You'll have check-ups to see how well it's working and if you're getting any side effects. If you have severe pain, if pain is affecting your daily activities, or if medicines from a GP have not worked, the GP may refer you for: cognitive behavioural therapy – a type of talking therapy that can help you cope with pain treatment from a specialist in nerve conditions (neurologist) or a specialist pain clinic – this may include treatments such as stronger skin patches, injections, or talking therapies to help you cope Information: Find more advice and support to help with pain Things you can do to help with post-herpetic neuralgia If you have post-herpetic neuralgia there are things you can do to help ease the symptoms.

    "text": "Overview - Post-polio syndrome Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is a poorly understood condition that can affect people who have had polio in the past. Polio is a viral infection that used to be common in the UK but is now rare. Most people who had polio would have fought off the infection without even realising they were infected. Some people with polio would have had paralysis , muscle weakness and shrinking of the muscles. But usually these problems would have either gone away over the following weeks or months, or remained the same for years afterwards. Post-polio syndrome is where some of these symptoms develop or get worse many years or decades after the original polio infection. Symptoms of post-polio syndrome Post-polio syndrome can include a wide range of symptoms that usually develop gradually over time, including: persistent fatigue (extreme tiredness) muscle weakness shrinking muscles muscle and joint pain sleep apnoea The condition can have a significant impact on everyday life, making it very difficult to move about and carry out certain tasks and activities. The symptoms tend to get gradually worse over many years, but this happens very slowly and treatment may help slow it down further. Post-polio syndrome is rarely life-threatening, although some people develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems, such as chest infections . Read more about the symptoms of post-polio syndrome and diagnosing post-polio syndrome . Who's affected Post-polio syndrome only affects people who have had polio. It usually develops 15 or more years after the infection. It's not known exactly how many people who survived polio when they were younger are or will be affected by post-polio syndrome. Estimates vary from as low as 15% to as high as 80%. What causes post-polio syndrome? The exact cause of post-polio syndrome is unclear. It's not known whether anything can be done to prevent it. The leading theory is that it's the result of the gradual deterioration of nerve cells in the spinal cord (motor neurones) that were damaged by the polio virus. This would explain why the condition can take years to appear. Post-polio syndrome isn't contagious. The theory that the polio virus may lie dormant in your body, causing post-polio syndrome when it becomes reactivated at a later stage, has not been proven. It's not clear why only some people who have had polio develop post-polio syndrome. However, those who had severe polio when they were younger may be more likely to develop the condition. How post-polio syndrome is treated There's currently no cure for post-polio syndrome, but support and a range of treatments are available to help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. Some of the ways that symptoms of post-polio syndrome may be managed include: rest and exercise – such as learning to stop activities before becoming exhausted mobility aids – such as walking sticks or scooters weight control and healthy eating – to avoid putting unnecessary strain on muscles and joints painkilling medication – to help relieve muscle or joint pain psychological support – such as discussions with a GP, on an online forum, or in a local support group Read more about treating post-polio syndrome .

Causes of Prader-Willi syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by some missing genetic material in a group of genes on chromosome number 15. This leads to a number of problems and is thought to affect part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which produces hormones and regulates growth and appetite. This may explain some of the typical features of Prader-Willi syndrome, such as delayed growth and persistent hunger. The genetic cause happens purely by chance, and boys and girls of all ethnic backgrounds can be affected. It's extremely rare for parents to have more than 1 child with Prader-Willi syndrome. Read more about the causes of Prader-Willi syndrome . Diagnosing Prader-Willi syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome can usually be confirmed by carrying out genetic testing . Genetic testing may be recommended if a child has the symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome . Babies who are very floppy at birth may also be tested. Read more about diagnosing Prader-Willi syndrome . Managing Prader-Willi syndrome There's no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and associated difficulties. This includes managing the person's excessive appetite and behavioural challenges. One of the most important parts of caring for someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is to try to maintain a normal weight. They should have a healthy, balanced diet, avoiding sweet treats and high-calorie items right from the start. If someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is allowed to eat as much as they want, they'll quickly become dangerously overweight. Someone with the syndrome can eat much more than other people and still feel hungry. Limiting food intake can be very challenging. People with Prader-Willi syndrome may become frustrated when they want extra food, and their hunger can make them hide or steal food. Read more about managing Prader-Willi syndrome . Long-term problems caused by Prader-Willi syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome itself is not life-threatening. But compulsive eating and weight gain can cause young adults with the syndrome to develop serious obesity-related conditions such as: type 2 diabetes heart failure breathing difficulties If their diet is well controlled and they do not become overweight, adults can have a good quality of life and probably a normal life expectancy. Many adults with Prader-Willi syndrome take part in activities such as voluntary or part-time work but it's unlikely they'll be able to live fully independent lives. The increased appetite also means there's a higher risk of choking on food, so carers are advised to learn what to do if someone is choking . PWSA UK The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association UK (PWSA UK) provides information and support for people whose lives are affected by the syndrome. You can call the PWSA UK helpline on 01332 365676. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If your child has Prader-Willi syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat Prader-Willi syndrome. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Overview - Pre-eclampsia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women, usually during the second half of pregnancy (from 20 weeks) or soon after their baby is delivered. Symptoms of pre-eclampsia Early signs of pre-eclampsia include having high blood pressure (hypertension) and protein in your urine (proteinuria). It's unlikely that you'll notice these signs, but they should be picked up during your routine antenatal appointments . In some cases, further symptoms can develop, including: severe headache vision problems, such as blurring or flashing pain just below the ribs vomiting sudden swelling of the face, hands or feet If you notice any symptoms of pre-eclampsia, seek medical advice immediately by calling your midwife, GP surgery or NHS 111. Although many cases are mild, the condition can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby if it's not monitored and treated. The earlier pre-eclampsia is diagnosed and monitored, the better the outlook for mother and baby. Video: what is pre-eclampsia and what are the warning signs? In this video, a midwife explains the warning signs of pre-eclampsia. Media last reviewed: 1 September 2023 Media review due: 1 September 2026 Who's affected? There are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia, such as: having diabetes , high blood pressure or kidney disease before you were pregnant having an autoimmune condition, such as lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome having high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy Other things that can slightly increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia include: a family history of pre-eclampsia being 40 years old or more it's more than 10 years since your last pregnancy expecting multiple babies (twins or triplets) having a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more If you have 2 or more of these together, your chances are higher. If you're thought to be at a high risk of developing pre-eclampsia, you may be advised to take a 75 to 150mg daily dose of aspirin from the 12th week of pregnancy until your baby is born. What causes pre-eclampsia? Although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, it's thought to occur when there's a problem with the placenta, the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's. Treating pre-eclampsia If you're diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, you should be referred for an assessment by a specialist, usually in hospital. While in hospital, you'll be monitored closely to determine how severe the condition is and whether a hospital stay is needed. The only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to deliver the baby, so you'll usually be monitored regularly until it's possible for your baby to be delivered. This will normally be at around 37 to 38 weeks of pregnancy, but it may be earlier in more severe cases. At this point, labour may be started artificially (induced) or you may have a caesarean section . You'll be offered medicine to lower your blood pressure while you wait for your baby to be delivered. Complications Although most cases of pre-eclampsia cause no problems and improve soon after the baby is delivered, there's a risk of serious complications that can affect both the mother and her baby. There's a risk that the mother will develop fits called \"eclampsia\". These fits can be life threatening for the mother and baby, but they're rare.

    "title": "Ejaculation problems",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ejaculation-problems/",
    "text": "Ejaculation problems Ejaculation problems are common sexual problems in men. The 3 main types of ejaculation problems are: premature ejaculation delayed ejaculation retrograde ejaculation If you have a persistent problem with ejaculation, visit your GP, who will discuss the problem with you and may examine you or refer you to a specialist. Premature ejaculation Premature ejaculation is a common ejaculation problem. It's where the male ejaculates sooner than he or his partner wishes during sexual arousal. Occasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and are not a cause for concern. However, if you're finding that it happens more than you'd like, and it's a problem for you, it might help to get treatment. Causes of premature ejaculation Various psychological and physical factors can cause a man to suddenly experience premature ejaculation. Common physical causes include: prostate problems thyroid problems – an overactive thyroid or an underactive thyroid using recreational drugs Common psychological causes may include: depression stress relationship problems anxiety about sexual performance (particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous problems with sexual performance) It's possible for a man to have experienced premature ejaculation since becoming sexually active. A number of possible causes for this are: conditioning – it's possible that early sexual experiences can influence future sexual behaviour. For example, if a teenager conditions himself to ejaculate quickly to avoid being caught masturbating, it may later be difficult to break the habit a previous traumatic sexual experience – this can range from being caught masturbating to sexual abuse a strict upbringing and beliefs about sex Treating premature ejaculation Antidepressants Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant , but they also delay ejaculation. SSRIs used for this purpose include: paroxetine sertraline fluoxetine (Prozac) Another type of antidepressant called clomipramine is also sometimes used. Some men may experience an improvement a few days after treatment begins. However, you'll usually need to take the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks before you notice the full effects. Side effects of SSRIs are usually mild and should improve after 2 to 3 weeks. They include: feeling sick and being sick diarrhoea excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) Read more about the side effects of antidepressants . Dapoxetine (Priligy) An SSRI specifically designed to treat premature ejaculation, known as dapoxetine (Priligy), has been licensed in the UK. Local NHS authorities can choose to prescribe it on the NHS. It acts much faster than the other SSRIs used for premature ejaculation and can be used \"on demand\". You'll usually be advised to take it between 1 and 3 hours before sex, but not more than once a day. Your response to the treatment will then be reviewed after 4 weeks (or after 6 doses), and again every 6 months. Dapoxetine is not suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation. For example, it is not recommended for some men with heart, kidney and liver problems. It can also interact with other medicines, such as other antidepressants. Common side effects include: headaches dizziness feeling sick Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), are a class of medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction. Research has found that they may also help with premature ejaculation. You can get sildenafil on prescription, or buy it from a pharmacy after a discussion with the pharmacist to make sure it's safe for you to take. Read more about sildenafil including information on how and when to take it . Topical anaesthetics and condoms The use of topical anaesthetics such as lidocaine or prilocaine can help but may be transferred and absorbed to the vagina, causing decreased sensation. Condoms can also be used and are effective, particularly when combined with local anaesthesia. Things you can try yourself There are also a number of things you can try yourself. It can sometimes help to: masturbate an hour or 2 before having sex use a thick condom to help decrease sensation have sex with your partner on top (to allow them to pull away when you are close to ejaculating) Psychosexual counselling You may benefit from having psychosexual counselling, where a therapist can help you, and a partner if you have one, with sex related problems. During these sessions, the therapist will: encourage you to explore any relationship issues you may have, and give advice about how to resolve them show you techniques that can help you \"unlearn\" the habit of premature ejaculation (these include the \"squeeze\" and \"stop-go\" techniques) In the squeeze technique, you masturbate but stop before the point of ejaculation and squeeze the head of your penis for between 10 to 20 seconds. Then let go and wait for another 30 seconds before resuming masturbation. This process is carried out several times before ejaculation is allowed to occur. The stop-go technique is similar, but you do not squeeze your penis. Once you feel more confident about delaying ejaculation, you could try this technique during sex, stopping and starting as required. These techniques may sound simple, but they require lots of practice. Delayed ejaculation Delayed ejaculation (male orgasmic disorder) is classed as either: experiencing a significant delay before ejaculation being unable to ejaculate at all, even though the man wants to and his erection is normal You may have delayed ejaculation if you're unable to ejaculate more than half the times you have sex. Causes of delayed ejaculation Like premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation can be caused by psychological and physical factors. Possible psychological causes of delayed ejaculation are similar to those of premature ejaculation – for example, relationship problems, stress or depression. Physical causes of delayed ejaculation include: diabetes spinal cord injuries multiple sclerosis surgery to the bladder or prostate gland increasing age Many medicines are known to cause delayed ejaculation, including: antidepressants , particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medicines to treat high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers antipsychotics, used to treat episodes of psychosis Delayed ejaculation can suddenly start to happen after previously having no problems, or (less commonly) the man may have always experienced it. Treating delayed ejaculation Sex therapy Sex therapy is a form of counselling that uses a combination of psychotherapy and structured changes in your sex life. This can help to increase your feeling of enjoyment during sex and help make ejaculation easier. Some integrated care boards (ICBs) provide a sex therapy service on the NHS. Availability can vary widely depending on where you live. You can also pay privately. The College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists website provides information about private sex therapists and how to find a therapist in your local area . The relationship counselling service Relate also offers sex therapy at a number of its centres . You'll need to pay for each session. During sex therapy, you'll have the opportunity to discuss any emotional or psychological issues related to your sexuality and relationship, in a non-judgemental way. Activities may also be recommended for you to try at home while you're having sex with your partner (you should never be asked to take part in any sexual activities during a session with the therapist). These may include: erotic fantasies and \"sex games\" to make your lovemaking more exciting using sexual aids, such as vibrators, to increase pleasure Read more information about what a sex therapist can do . Switching medicine There are a number of medicines that can be used if it's thought SSRIs are responsible for causing delayed ejaculation. These include: amantadine – originally designed to treat viral infections bupropion – usually prescribed to help people quit smoking yohimbine – originally designed to treat erectile dysfunction These help block some of the chemical effects of SSRIs that may contribute towards delayed ejaculation. Alcohol and drugs Alcohol misuse and recreational drug use can be separate underlying causes of delayed ejaculation, so addressing these problems may help. Read more about getting help with alcohol misuse and drug use . Pseudoephedrine Pseudoephedrine tablets may be tried, but these will need to be prescribed \"off-label\". This means the medicine shows promise in treating delayed ejaculation but it has not been licensed for this particular use (pseudoephedrine is normally used as a decongestant). Retrograde ejaculation Retrograde ejaculation is a rarer type of ejaculation problem. It happens when semen travels backwards into the bladder instead of through the urethra (the tube that urine passes through). The main symptoms of retrograde ejaculation include: producing no semen, or only a small amount, during ejaculation producing cloudy urine (because of the semen in it) when you first go to the toilet after having sex Men with retrograde ejaculation still experience the feeling of an orgasm and the condition does not pose a danger to health. However, it can affect the ability to father a child. Causes of retrograde ejaculation Retrograde ejaculation happens when the neck of the bladder does not close and semen passes into the bladder. Usually when you ejaculate, semen is pushed out of your urethra. It is prevented from entering your bladder by the muscles around the neck of the bladder, which close tightly at the moment of orgasm. However, damage to the surrounding muscles or nerves can stop the bladder neck closing, causing the semen to move into the bladder rather than up through the urethra. Causes of retrograde ejaculation include prostate gland surgery , bladder surgery, diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and a class of medicines known as alpha blockers, which are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Treating retrograde ejaculation Most men do not need treatment for retrograde ejaculation because they are still able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the condition does not have adverse effects on their health. But if treatment is required (usually because of wanting to father a child), there are options to try. For example, pseudoephedrine (commonly used as a decongestant) has proved effective in treating retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery. If retrograde ejaculation is caused by using a certain medicine, then normal ejaculation will usually return once medicine is stopped. Speak to your GP before stopping any prescribed medicine. However, if the retrograde ejaculation has been caused by significant muscle or nerve damage, treatment may not be possible. Men who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine or testicles for use in intrauterine insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) . Involve your partner If you're having problems with your sex life and are seeking treatment, it is usually recommended you involve your partner as much as possible. Communicating your concerns can often go a long way to helping to resolve them. And, in some cases, your partner may also have their own problems that are contributing towards problems with your sex life. For example, some women are unable to reach climax during \"normal\" intercourse and require manual or oral stimulation. Blood in your semen Finding blood in your semen can be alarming. However, in most cases it's not serious and will pass within a few days. It can be caused by an infection of your urethra ( urethritis ) or prostate ( prostatitis ). See your GP if you have blood in your semen. They can check if you need further tests or treatment. Read more about blood in the semen .

You have a higher chance of getting them if you have difficulty moving. Symptoms of a pressure ulcer Pressure ulcers usually form on bony parts of the body, such as the heels, elbows, hips and tailbone. Symptoms of a pressure ulcer include: discoloured patches of skin that do not change colour when pressed – the patches are usually red on white skin, or purple or blue on black or brown skin a patch of skin that feels warm, spongy or hard pain or itchiness in the affected area of skin The ulcers usually develop gradually, but can sometimes appear over a few hours. They can become a blister or open wound. If left untreated, they can get worse and eventually reach deeper layers of skin or muscle and bone. Credit: DR P.

Changing position and moving regularly is important to help relieve pressure on the ulcers and help stop new ones forming. Other treatments include: specially designed mattresses and cushions dressings to protect the ulcer and help it heal creams and ointments antibiotics if the ulcer is infected cleaning the ulcer If the pressure ulcer is severe or other treatments have not worked, you may need to have surgery to clean and close the ulcer. Causes of pressure ulcers Pressure ulcers are caused by something putting pressure on or rubbing your skin. It can happen to anyone, but it's usually if you have problems moving, as this can mean the weight of your body is always putting pressure on the same areas of skin, which can damage it. You have a higher chance of getting a pressure ulcer if you: have problems moving have had a pressure ulcer before have been seriously ill in intensive care or have recently had surgery are underweight have swollen, sweaty or broken skin have poor circulation or fragile skin have problems feeling sensation or pain Things you can do to prevent pressure ulcers If you're being cared for at home, there are things you and your care team can do to lower your chances of getting a pressure ulcer. Do change position regularly use specially designed mattresses and cushions check your skin every day for symptoms of a pressure ulcer try to stay active, if possible eat a healthy, balanced diet Don’t do not smoke Information: If you're being cared for at home and think you're at risk of getting pressure ulcers, you can ask a GP for a risk assessment so your care team can make a plan to prevent them.

    "text": "Overview - Primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis) Contents Overview Symptoms Treatment Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC, often referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis) is a type of liver disease that can get gradually worse over time. Without treatment, it may eventually lead to liver failure. Symptoms of PBC PBC does not always cause symptoms, but some people may experience: bone and joint aches fatigue (extreme tiredness) itchy skin dry eyes and mouth pain or discomfort in the upper right side of their tummy Read more about the symptoms of PBC How PBC is diagnosed Many people are only diagnosed with PBC after having a routine blood test for another reason. PBC can usually be diagnosed just using blood tests. Once PBC is diagnosed, you'll also need an ultrasound scan to help rule out other problems with your bile ducts and assess your liver. A liver biopsy is occasionally recommended to assess your liver and help doctors decide on the best treatment. This involves safely removing a small sample of liver tissue so it can be studied under a microscope. Causes of PBC Bile is a liquid produced inside the liver that's used to help digest fats, absorb certain vitamins and remove waste products from the body. It passes out of the liver through small tubes called bile ducts. In PBC, the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakenly attacks the bile ducts. It's not clear why this happens, but it's thought to be caused by a combination of subtle differences in how the immune system works. The bile ducts become damaged and injured, causing bile to build up in the liver. This further damages the liver and may lead to scarring ( cirrhosis ). How PBC is treated PBC is a progressive condition, which means the damage to the liver can steadily get worse over time. The rate at which PBC progresses varies between individuals. Sometimes, it can take decades. Without treatment, the liver can become so badly damaged that it no longer works properly. This is known as liver failure and can be fatal. Current treatments such as ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid can help slow down liver damage caused by PBC. Other medicines can help relieve the itchiness associated with PBC. Occasionally, if the liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant may be needed. Read more about treating PBC Complications of PBC If PBC is not treated or reaches an advanced stage, there may be other problems including: osteoporosis – a condition in which the bones become weak and brittle portal hypertension – increased blood pressure inside the blood vessels in your abdomen ascites – a build-up of fluid in your abdomen (stomach) and around your intestines vitamin deficiencies – including vitamins A, D, E and K a slightly increased risk of developing liver cancer Page last reviewed: 02 February 2024 Next review due: 02 February 2027 Next : Symptoms"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp/",
    "text": "Overview - Progressive supranuclear palsy Contents Overview Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurological condition that can cause problems with balance, movement, vision, speech and swallowing. It's caused by increasing numbers of brain cells becoming damaged over time. The PSP Association estimates there are around 4,000 people with PSP living in the UK. But it's thought the true figure could be much higher as many cases may be misdiagnosed. Most cases of PSP develop in people who are over the age of 60. What causes PSP? PSP occurs when brain cells in certain parts of the brain are damaged as a result of a build-up of a protein called tau. Tau occurs naturally in the brain and is usually broken down before it reaches high levels. In people with PSP, it isn't broken down properly and forms harmful clumps in brain cells. The amount of abnormal tau in the brain can vary among people with PSP, as can the location of these clumps. This means the condition can have a wide range of symptoms. The condition has been linked to changes in certain genes, but these genetic faults aren't inherited and the risk to other family members, including the children or siblings of someone with PSP, is very low. PSP symptoms The symptoms of PSP usually get gradually worse over time. At first, they can be similar to some other conditions, which makes it difficult to diagnose early on. Some of the main symptoms of PSP include: problems with balance and mobility, including frequent falls changes in behaviour, such as irritability or apathy (lack of interest) muscle stiffness an inability to control eye and eyelid movement, including focusing on specific objects or looking up or down at something slow, quiet or slurred speech difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) slowness of thought and some memory problems The rate at which the symptoms progress can vary widely from person to person. Read more about the symptoms of PSP . Diagnosing PSP There's no single test for PSP. Instead, the diagnosis is based on the pattern of your symptoms. Your doctor will try to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as Parkinson's disease. The large number of possible symptoms of PSP also makes it difficult to diagnose correctly and can mean it takes a while to get a definitive diagnosis. You may need to have a brain scan to look for other possible causes of your symptoms, as well as tests of your memory, concentration and ability to understand language. The diagnosis must be made or confirmed by a consultant with expertise in PSP. This will usually be a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves). Read more about how PSP is diagnosed . Treatments for PSP There's currently no cure for PSP, but research is continuing into new treatments that aim to relieve symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition. Treatment currently focuses on relieving the symptoms while trying to make sure someone with PSP has the best possible quality of life. As someone with PSP can be affected in many different ways, treatment and care is provided by a team of health and social care professionals working together. Treatment will be tailored to meet the needs of each individual and may include: medication to improve balance, stiffness and other symptoms physiotherapy to help with movement and balance difficulties speech and language therapy to help with speech or swallowing problems occupational therapy to help improve the skills needed for daily activities Botox (botulinum toxin injections) or special glasses to help with eye problems feeding tubes to help manage dysphagia and avoid malnutrition or dehydration Read more about how PSP is treated . Outlook There's currently nothing that can be done to stop PSP gradually worsening, although research into new treatments gives hope that this may be possible in the future. Good care and assistance can help someone with PSP to be more independent and enjoy a better quality of life, but the condition will eventually put them at risk of serious complications. It's a good idea to talk to your doctor about what you'd like to happen when the condition reaches this stage. Difficulty swallowing can cause choking or inhaling food or liquid into the airways. This can lead to pneumonia , which can be life threatening. Help from a speech and language therapist at an early stage can lower this risk for as long as possible. Sharing your information If you have PSP, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

It can be the womb (uterus), bowel, bladder or top of the vagina. A prolapse is not life threatening, but it can cause pain and discomfort. Symptoms can usually be improved with pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes, but sometimes medical treatment is needed. Symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms include: a feeling of heaviness around your lower tummy and genitals a dragging discomfort inside your vagina feeling like there's something coming down into your vagina – it may feel like sitting on a small ball feeling or seeing a bulge or lump in or coming out of your vagina discomfort or numbness during sex problems peeing – such as feeling like your bladder is not emptying fully, needing to go to the toilet more often, or leaking a small amount of pee when you cough, sneeze or exercise (stress incontinence) Sometimes pelvic organ prolapse has no symptoms and is found during an internal examination carried out for another reason, such as cervical screening . When to see a GP See a GP if you have any of the symptoms of a prolapse, or if you notice a lump in or around your vagina. What happens at your appointment Your doctor will ask if they can do an internal pelvic examination. For this you'll need to undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination bed. Your doctor will then feel for any lumps in your pelvic area and inside your vagina. They may gently put an instrument called a speculum into your vagina to hold the walls of it open so they can see if there's a prolapse. Sometimes they'll ask you to lie on your left-hand side and examine you in that position to get a better view of the prolapse. You can ask for this examination to be done by a female doctor and, if you like, bring someone you trust along with you for support. Further tests If you have problems with your bladder, a GP may refer you to hospital for further tests. These may include: a urine test to look for an infection inserting a small tube into your bladder to look for any problems Treatment for pelvic organ prolapse If you do not have any symptoms, or the prolapse is mild and not bothering you, you may not need medical treatment. But making some lifestyle changes will probably still help. These include: losing weight if you're overweight avoiding heavy lifting preventing or treating constipation If the prolapse is more severe or your symptoms are affecting your daily life, there are several further treatment options to consider. These include: pelvic floor exercises hormone treatment vaginal pessaries surgery The recommended treatment will depend on the type and severity of the prolapse, your symptoms and your overall health. You and your doctor will decide together what's the best option for you. Causes of pelvic organ prolapse Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the group of muscles and tissues that normally support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened and cannot hold the organs in place firmly. A number of things can weaken your pelvic floor and increase your chance of developing pelvic organ prolapse. These include: pregnancy and childbirth – especially if you had a long, difficult birth, or if you gave birth to a large baby or multiple babies getting older and going through the menopause being overweight having long-term constipation or a long-term health condition that causes you to cough and strain having a hysterectomy a job that requires a lot of heavy lifting Some health conditions can also make a prolapse more likely, including: joint hypermobility syndrome Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndromes Types of prolapse The 4 main types of prolapse are: the bladder bulging into the front wall of the vagina (anterior prolapse) the womb bulging or hanging down into the vagina (uterine prolapse) the top of the vagina sagging down – this happens to some women after they have had surgery to remove their womb the bowel bulging forward into the back wall of the vagina (posterior wall prolapse) It's possible to have more than 1 of these at the same time. Pelvic organ prolapse will usually be classified on a scale of 1 to 4 to show how severe it is, with 4 being a severe prolapse.

There is no treatment, but there are things you can do to help you recognise people. Symptoms of prosopagnosia (face blindness) The main symptom of prosopagnosia is having difficulty recognising faces. You'll still see the parts of a face normally, but all faces may look the same to you. It affects people differently. Some people may not be able to tell the difference between strangers or people they do not know well. Others may not recognise the faces of friends and family, or even their own face. Other symptoms of prosopagnosia can include difficulty with: recognising emotions on people's faces recognising people's age and gender recognising characters and following plots in TV programmes or films recognising other things, such as cars or animals finding your way around Difficulty recognising faces may make it harder to form relationships, or cause problems at work or school. This may affect your mental health and may lead to social anxiety or depression . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you're struggling to recognise people's faces and it's affecting your life They may refer you to a specialist for an assessment. Things you can try to help with prosopagnosia (face blindness) There's no treatment for prosopagnosia, but there are things you can do to help recognise people. Do tell people about the condition before you meet them ask people you're close to for help identifying others ask people to introduce themselves when you greet them use people's voices or body language to tell them apart make a note of distinctive features about a person such as hairstyle, jewellery or accessories use name tags or write down the names of colleagues and where they sit at work Causes of prosopagnosia (face blindness) Prosopagnosia is caused by a problem with the part of the brain that processes information about faces. It can happen: if you do not develop the ability to recognise faces – this is the most common type and may run in families from brain damage, such as following a stroke , head injury, inflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ), or Alzheimer's disease if you're autistic Find out more: Information: Bournemouth University: face blindness research project – find out about taking part in a study Face Blind UK: coping strategies Coping with depression How to cope with anxiety Page last reviewed: 30 January 2023 Next review due: 30 January 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Prostate cancer Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs for many years. Symptoms of prostate cancer Symptoms of prostate cancer do not usually appear until the prostate is large enough to affect the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis (urethra). When this happens, you may notice things like: an increased need to pee straining while you pee a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied These symptoms should not be ignored, but they do not mean you have prostate cancer. It's more likely they're caused by something else, such as prostate enlargement . What is the prostate? The prostate is a small gland in the pelvis and is part of the male reproductive system. About the size of a walnut, it's located between the penis and the bladder, and surrounds the urethra. The main function of the prostate is to produce a thick white fluid that creates semen when mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles. Causes of prostate cancer The causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. But certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition. The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men aged 50 or older. For reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in black men and less common in Asian men. Men whose father or brother were affected by prostate cancer are at slightly increased risk themselves. Recent research also suggests that obesity increases the risk of prostate cancer. Tests for prostate cancer There's no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks that your doctor should discuss with you. The most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are: blood tests a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination, or DRE ) an MRI scan a biopsy Find out more about how prostate cancer is diagnosed PSA testing The blood test, called a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer. If you are over 50, you can ask a GP for a PSA test. PSA tests are not routinely used to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable. Your PSA level can also be raised by other, non-cancerous conditions. Raised PSA levels also cannot tell a doctor whether you have life-threatening prostate cancer or not. If you have a raised PSA level, you may be offered an MRI scan of the prostate to help doctors decide if you need further tests and treatment. Find out more about PSA screening and testing in the UK Treating prostate cancer If you do have prostate cancer, you may not need treatment. If the cancer is at an early stage and not causing symptoms, your doctor may suggest either \"watchful waiting\" or \"active surveillance\". The best option depends on your age and overall health. Both options involve carefully monitoring your condition. Some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. Treatments include: surgically removing the prostate radiotherapy – either on its own or alongside hormone therapy Some cases are only diagnosed at a later stage, when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body and cannot be cured, treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms. All treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms, such as needing to use the toilet more urgently or more often. For this reason, you may choose to delay treatment until there's a risk the cancer might spread. Newer treatments, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects. Some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy. But the long-term effectiveness of these treatments is not known yet. Living with prostate cancer As prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment. Nevertheless, it can affect your life. As well as the possible side effects of treatment, a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel anxious or depressed . You may find it beneficial to talk about the condition with your family, friends, a GP and other people with prostate cancer. Financial support is also available if prostate cancer reduces your ability to work.

    "text": "Enlarged prostate An enlarged prostate (sometimes called benign prostate enlargement) is when your prostate gets bigger. It's common and is not usually serious, but there are treatments that can help if you need them. An enlarged prostate is most common in men over 50 years old. It can affect anyone with a prostate. What the prostate is The prostate is a small gland below the bladder that makes semen and controls the flow of pee from your bladder to your penis. If it gets bigger (enlarged) it can put pressure on the tube that carries pee from your bladder (urethra), causing problems with peeing. Credit: Multimedia Team - nhs.uk Symptoms of an enlarged prostate The main symptoms of an enlarged prostate are problems with peeing, such as: difficulty starting to pee, or having to push or strain to pee a weak flow of pee, stopping and starting, and taking longer than usual to empty your bladder feeling like you cannot fully empty your bladder dribbling pee after you finish peeing needing to pee more often or urgently, including getting up to pee during the night The symptoms usually develop slowly, and may gradually get worse as you get older. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have difficulty peeing or need to pee more frequently Try not to be embarrassed. The GP will be used to talking about these symptoms. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have blood in your pee – your pee may look pink, red or brown you have pain when peeing you cannot pee at all You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Important It's important to get these symptoms checked by a GP because they can sometimes be caused by other more serious conditions, such as prostate cancer . If they're caused by cancer, finding it early may mean it's easier to treat. How an enlarged prostate is diagnosed If a GP thinks you could have an enlarged prostate they'll ask about your symptoms, such as how often you pee. They may ask to examine your tummy (abdomen) and penis, and feel inside your bottom with their finger to check the size of your prostate ( rectal examination ). They'll usually ask you to keep a record for at least 3 days of how much you drink, and how often and how much you pee. Tests the GP might do include: testing a sample of your pee a blood test called a PSA test They may refer you to a specialist in hospital for more tests, such as: a urine flow test, where you pee into a machine that measures how you pee an ultrasound scan of your bladder a procedure to look inside your bladder with a camera ( cystoscopy ) Treatment for an enlarged prostate An enlarged prostate does not always need treatment. It depends on your symptoms and how they're affecting you. If your symptoms are not causing many problems, doctors will usually recommend trying lifestyle changes first. If your symptoms get worse you may need medicines or surgery. Medicines for an enlarged prostate If you have moderate or severe symptoms you may be offered medicines for an enlarged prostate, including: medicines that help you to pee, such as tamsulosin , doxazosin or alfuzosin medicines that help with needing to pee more often or more urgently, such as oxybutynin or tolterodine medicines that help stop your prostate growing, by reducing hormone levels, if you're at high risk of your condition getting worse, such as finasteride or dutasteride These medicines can cause side effects. Your doctor will explain the benefits and possible side effects and help you decide if they are right for you. You'll have regular check-ups to see how well the medicine is working. Surgery for an enlarged prostate You might be offered surgery if medicines have not helped, or your symptoms are severe. The most common surgery you may be offered for an enlarged prostate is called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) . This involves removing part of your prostate through a thin tube that's passed up your penis to your prostate. Sometimes you may be offered a different procedure, but they may not be suitable for everyone. They include: removing or destroying part of your prostate using lasers, an electrical current, steam or a jet of water holding part of your prostate open and widening your urethra, using a small implant making small cuts in your prostate around the opening to the bladder removing part of your prostate using surgery The surgeon will explain your options, the risks and benefits of the procedure, and what will happen. Treatments and support for living with an enlarged prostate Treatment and support is also available to help with symptoms of an enlarged prostate. This can include: products such as pads, pants or sheaths to help with leaks or dribbling pee a urinary catheter – a flexible tube that's put into your bladder to drain pee, if you cannot empty your bladder help with bladder training, where you try holding on for a short time when you need to pee, and gradually increase the time over a few weeks pelvic floor muscle training – exercises to strengthen muscles that help control your bladder Information: Find out more NHS England: decision support tool – making a decision about enlarged prostate Prostate Cancer UK: how is an enlarged prostate treated?

    "text": "Overview - Psoriasis Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Living with Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes flaky patches of skin which form scales. On brown, black and white skin the patches can look pink or red, and the scales white or silvery. On brown and black skin the patches can also look purple or dark brown, and the scales may look grey. These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore. Psoriasis affects around 2 in 100 people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults between 20 and 30 years old and between 50 and 60 years old. It affects men and women equally. The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a big impact on their quality of life. Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe. Why it happens People with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells. Skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only takes about 3 to 7 days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis. Although the process is not fully understood, it's thought to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system is your body's defence against disease and infection, but it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake in people with psoriasis. Psoriasis can run in families, although the exact role genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. Many people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. Possible triggers of psoriasis include an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines. The condition is not contagious, so it cannot be spread from person to person. How psoriasis is diagnosed A GP can often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin. You may be referred to a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions (dermatologist) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe. In rare cases, a small sample of skin called a biopsy will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. If your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in arthritis (rheumatologist). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis , and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken. Treating psoriasis There's no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches. Your doctor will ask you about how much the condition is affecting your everyday life. In most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or topical corticosteroids . Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin. If these are not effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light. In severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body. Living with psoriasis Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected. For example, some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. It's also quite common to develop tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis. Speak to a GP or your healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. They can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. There are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as the Psoriasis Association , where you can speak to other people with the condition.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/early-or-delayed-puberty/",
    "text": "Early or delayed puberty Puberty is when a child's body begins to develop and change as they become an adult. Signs of puberty include girls developing breasts and starting periods , and boys developing a larger penis and testicles, a deeper voice and a more muscular appearance. The average age for girls to start puberty is 11, while for boys the average age is 12. But it's perfectly normal for puberty to begin at any point between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys. There's not usually any need to worry if puberty does not start around the average age, but it's a good idea to speak to your GP for advice if it starts before 8 or has not started by around 14. In some cases, early puberty or delayed puberty could be a sign of an underlying condition that may need to be treated. Early puberty Early puberty, also called precocious puberty, is when: girls have signs of puberty before 8 years of age boys have signs of puberty before 9 years of age Some girls and boys may develop certain signs of puberty at a young age, but not others. For example, girls may start periods before the age of 8 but have no breast development. See your GP if this happens to your child. Causes of early puberty It's not always clear what causes early puberty. It may just be a tendency that runs in your family. Occasionally it can be caused by: a problem in the brain, such as a brain tumour damage to the brain as a result of an infection, surgery or radiotherapy a problem with the ovaries or thyroid gland a genetic disorder, such as McCune-Albright syndrome – read more about McCune-Albright syndrome on the MedlinePlus website Early puberty mostly affects girls and often has no obvious cause. It's less common in boys and may be more likely to be associated with an underlying problem. Tests and treatments for early puberty Your GP may refer you to a specialist if they think there could be an underlying cause that needs to be investigated. Tests that may be carried out include: a blood test to check hormone levels a hand X-ray to help determine likely adult height an ultrasound scan or MRI scan to check for problems such as tumours Early puberty can be treated by: treating any underlying cause using medication to reduce hormone levels and pause sexual development for a few years Treatment with medication is usually only recommended if it's thought early puberty will cause emotional or physical problems, such as short height in adulthood or early periods in girls, which may cause significant distress. Delayed puberty Delayed puberty is when: boys have no signs of testicular development by 14 years of age girls have not started to develop breasts by 13 years of age, or they have developed breasts but their periods have not started by 15 Causes of delayed puberty It's not always clear what causes delayed puberty. It may just be a tendency that runs in your family. Delayed puberty is generally more common in boys. Occasionally it can be caused by: a long-term illness, such as cystic fibrosis , diabetes or kidney disease malnutrition , possibly from an eating disorder or a condition such as cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease a problem with the ovaries, testes, thyroid gland or pituitary gland differences in sex development , such as androgen insensitivity syndrome a genetic condition, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Kallmann syndrome – read more about Kallmann syndrome on the MedlinePlus website Tests and treatments for delayed puberty Your GP may refer you to a specialist if they think there could be an underlying cause of delayed puberty that needs to be investigated. Tests that may be carried out include a blood test to check hormone levels, a hand X-ray to help determine likely adult height, and an ultrasound or MRI scan to check for problems with glands or organs. Delayed puberty can be treated by: treating any underlying cause using medication for a few months to increase hormone levels and trigger the start of puberty Treatment with medication is usually only recommended if the lack of development is causing problems, such as significant distress.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pubic-lice/",
    "text": "Pubic lice Pubic lice are tiny insects that can live on body hair, especially the pubic hair around the penis or vagina. They're spread through close body contact, most commonly through sexual contact. Pubic lice are sometimes also called crabs. Symptoms of pubic lice Pubic lice are very small (2mm long) and grey-brown in colour. They can be hard to spot, but sometimes you may be able to see them in your hair. They most often live on pubic hair around the penis or vagina, but can also be found in hair on the chest, armpits, face and eyelashes. They do not affect hair on the head. Other symptoms of pubic lice include: itching, which is usually worse at night small red or blue spots on your skin (lice bites) white/yellow dots attached to your hair (lice eggs) dark red or brown spots in your underwear (lice poo) crusted or sticky eyelashes, if they're affected Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if: you think you might have pubic lice Pubic lice will not go away without treatment. If you're sure you have pubic lice, you may be able to get treatment from a pharmacist. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at your appointment If you go to a sexual health clinic or GP surgery because you think you have pubic lice, a doctor or nurse will check your hair for lice. They may check your pubic hair around your penis or vagina and any other areas that could be affected, such as your armpits, chest or eyelashes. To help spot any lice, they might use a comb and a magnifying lens. If they think you might have caught the lice during sex, they may ask about your sexual partners. They may also suggest getting tested for any sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . Treatment for pubic lice The main treatments for pubic lice are medicated creams or shampoos that kill the lice. You usually need to use the treatment on your whole body and leave it on for a few hours before washing it off. You'll need to repeat this again a week later to make sure all the lice have been killed. You may be asked to come back a week after you finish treatment, to check if the treatment has worked. Any current or recent sexual partners should also be treated, even if they do not have symptoms. How to stop pubic lice spreading While you're being treated for pubic lice, there are some things you can do to help stop the lice spreading to others and stop the lice coming back. Do wash your clothes and bedding on a hot wash (50C or higher), get them dry cleaned, or put them in a plastic bag for at least a week – this will help kill any lice vacuum your mattress to remove any lice Don’t do not share clothes, bedding or hygiene products (such as razors) do not have close body contact (including sexual contact) with anyone else during treatment How you get pubic lice Pubic lice are mainly spread by close body contact, most commonly sexual contact. The lice cannot jump or fly, but can climb from one person to another. You can also catch the lice from clothes, bedding or towels used by someone with pubic lice, but this is rare. How to avoid getting pubic lice It can be hard to prevent pubic lice. The only way to avoid getting them is to avoid having sexual contact (or sharing bedding or clothing) with anyone you know who has pubic lice, until they've been treated. Condoms and other forms of contraception will not protect you from pubic lice. But it's still a good idea to use condoms during sex because they reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Page last reviewed: 24 May 2022 Next review due: 24 May 2025"

Symptoms of pudendal neuralgia The main symptom of pudendal neuralgia is sharp, shooting, burning or tingling pain (nerve pain) or numbness in your: genitals (your vagina, vulva and clitoris or penis and scrotum) bottom and anus perineum (the area between your genitals and anus) pelvis The pain may be worse when sitting down and may get worse throughout the day. Other symptoms can include: needing to pee more often pain when peeing or pooing constipation a feeling of swelling or fullness in your anus or vagina difficulty getting an erection difficulty reaching orgasm pain when having sex Information: If you're not sure it's pudendal neuralgia Find out about other conditions that can cause: anal pain pelvic pain vulval pain testicle pain Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have pain in your genitals, bottom, anus or pelvis that does not get better How pudendal neuralgia is diagnosed Pudendal neuralgia can be hard to diagnose because it's rare and the symptoms are similar to other conditions. It's usually diagnosed based on your symptoms and by ruling out other causes. A GP may refer you for tests to look for what's causing your pain. Tests you may have include: a vaginal or rectal examination – a doctor will use their finger to feel for any problems inside your vagina or rectum (bottom) scans such as an MRI scan , CT scan or ultrasound scan a test called electromyography (EMG), where electrical signals sent from small sensors are used to check how your nerves work injections to numb one of the nerves in your pelvis Treatments for pudendal neuralgia Pudendal neuralgia can be hard to treat. The treatment will depend on how severe your pain is and what's causing it. A GP may recommend treatments such as: physiotherapy , including advice on exercises medicines that can help with nerve pain, such as amitriptyline , duloxetine , gabapentin or pregabalin a strong painkiller called tramadol , if other pain relief does not work and you need pain relief for a short time while you're waiting to see a specialist If you have severe pain or it's affecting your daily activities, the GP may refer you to a specialist in nerve conditions (neurologist) or a specialist pain clinic. Treatment from a specialist may include: injections to reduce pain surgery, if something is putting pressure on a nerve and other treatments have not worked psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy to help you cope with pain Things you can do to help pudendal neuralgia If you have pudendal neuralgia there are things you can do to help with the symptoms.

    "text": "Pulmonary embolism A pulmonary embolism is when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in your lungs. It can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: difficulty breathing that comes on suddenly chest pain that's worse when you breathe in coughing up blood You may also have pain, redness and swelling in one of your legs (usually the calf). These are symptoms of a blood clot, also called DVT (deep vein thrombosis) . Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have difficulty breathing which comes on suddenly you're coughing up blood You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have severe difficulty breathing you feel pain in your chest or upper back your heart is beating very fast someone has passed out These could be signs of a pulmonary embolism or another serious condition. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treating a pulmonary embolism If a GP thinks you've got a pulmonary embolism, you'll be sent to hospital for further tests and treatment. At hospital, you'll probably be given an injection of anticoagulant medicine before you get any test results. Anticoagulants stop blood clots getting bigger and prevent new clots forming. If tests confirm you have a pulmonary embolism, you'll continue with anticoagulant injections for at least 5 days. You'll also need to take anticoagulant tablets for at least 3 months. You should make a full recovery from a pulmonary embolism if it's spotted and treated early. Reduce your pulmonary embolism risk A pulmonary embolism often happens when part of the blood clot dislodges itself from your leg and travels up to your lungs, causing a blockage. There are measures you can take to lower your risk of getting a pulmonary embolism. If you're being treated in hospital for another condition, your medical team should take steps to prevent DVT (deep vein thrombosis) . A DVT can occasionally develop on long journeys such as bus, train or air travel. The risk of developing DVT is increased for flights lasting more than 4 hours. There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting a travel-related DVT. Do sit comfortably in your seat and choose an aisle seat if possible wear loose-fitting clothing make sure you have plenty of leg room drink water regularly take regular breaks from sitting bend and straighten your legs, feet and toes every 30 minutes while seated press the balls of your feet down hard against the floor every so often wear flight socks Don’t do not sit for long periods without moving do not drink alcohol do not drink too much coffee and other caffeine-based drinks do not take sleeping pills Page last reviewed: 25 May 2023 Next review due: 25 May 2026"

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/",
    "text": "Overview - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Contents Overview Diagnosis Treatment Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult. It's not clear what causes it, but it usually affects people who are around 70 to 75 years old, and is rare in people under 50. Several treatments can help reduce the rate at which IPF gets worse, but there's currently no treatment that can stop or reverse the scarring of the lungs. Symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time. Symptoms can include: shortness of breath a persistent dry cough tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers) Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath. When to get medical advice See a GP if you have struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than 3 weeks. These symptoms are not normal and should not be ignored. If a GP thinks you could have a lung condition such as IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as: breathing (lung function) tests blood tests a chest X-ray and CT scan a lung biopsy , where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed Find out more about the tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis In people with IPF, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred. This causes the lungs to become stiff and makes it difficult for oxygen to get into the blood. The reason this happens is not clear. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown. IPF has been linked to: exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust viral infections a family history of IPF – around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition acid reflux smoking But it's not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF. Treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis There's currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression. Treatments include: self care measures, such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly medicines to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib breathing oxygen through a mask – you can do this while you're at home or while you're out and about exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily (pulmonary rehabilitation) a lung transplant – this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare Find out more about how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated Further information UK Charities Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis and the Pulmonary Fibrosis Trust provide information and support for people affected by IPF as well as news items about ongoing research into the condition. Outlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable. Some people respond well to treatment and remain relatively free of symptoms for many years, while others may get rapidly worse or find the breathlessness debilitating. Other problems can also sometimes develop, including chest infections , pulmonary hypertension and heart failure . It's very difficult to predict how long someone with IPF will survive at the time of diagnosis. Regular monitoring over time can indicate whether it's getting worse quickly or slowly. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If you have IPF, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS help scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat IPF. You can opt out of the register at any time.

    "text": "Overview - Pulmonary hypertension Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary arteries). It's a serious condition that can damage the right side of the heart. The walls of the pulmonary arteries become thick and stiff, and cannot expand as well to allow blood through. The reduced blood flow makes it harder for the right side of the heart to pump blood through the arteries. If the right side of your heart has to continually work harder, it can gradually become weaker. This can lead to heart failure . Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition that can affect people of all ages, but it's more common in people who have another heart or lung condition. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include: shortness of breath tiredness feeling faint or dizzy chest pain ( angina ) a racing heartbeat ( palpitations ) swelling ( oedema ) in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy (abdomen) The symptoms often get worse during exercise, which can limit your ability to take part in physical activities. If you have a type of pulmonary hypertension known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), you may not have any symptoms until the condition is quite advanced. When to get medical help See a GP if you have any symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. They may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and they may carry out a physical examination. Call 999 or go to A&E if you get sudden chest pain that does not stop after a few minutes, or you have heart palpitations with chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling faint. These could be a sign of another condition such as a blood clot in your lungs or a serious heart problem. Correctly diagnosing pulmonary hypertension can sometimes take time because its symptoms are similar to those of many other heart and lung conditions. Tests you may have include a type of heart scan called an echocardiogram , and right heart catheterisation, where a thin, flexible tube is inserted into your pulmonary artery. Read more about how pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed . Causes of pulmonary hypertension The changes in the pulmonary arteries that lead to pulmonary hypertension can be caused by: various conditions that cause problems with the smaller branches of the pulmonary arteries (PAH) conditions that affect the left side of the heart lung diseases or a shortage of oxygen in the body (hypoxia) blood clots that cause narrowing or a blockage in the pulmonary arteries Read more about the causes of pulmonary hypertension . Treating pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension cannot be cured, but treatment can reduce the symptoms and help you manage your condition. Pulmonary hypertension usually gets worse over time. Left untreated, it may cause heart failure, which can be fatal, so it's important treatment is started as soon as possible. If another condition is causing pulmonary hypertension, the underlying condition should be treated first. This can sometimes prevent the pulmonary arteries being permanently damaged. Treatments for pulmonary hypertension may include anticoagulant medicines to reduce the blood's ability to thicken (clot) and diuretics to remove excess fluid as a result of heart failure. You may also be offered medicine to widen the blood vessels. Home oxygen therapy may also be prescribed if the level of oxygen in your blood is low. Read more about treating pulmonary hypertension . Outlook The outlook for pulmonary hypertension varies, depending on factors such as: what's causing it how quickly it's diagnosed how advanced your symptoms are whether you have another underlying health condition The specialist in charge of your care will be able to give you more detailed information. Having pulmonary hypertension can affect your ability to carry out everyday activities.

Symptoms of pyoderma gangrenosum The main symptom of pyoderma gangrenosum is a large, painful ulcer on your skin. It usually starts as a small bump, spot or blood blister that gets bigger quickly and turns into an ulcer. Sometimes you may have more than 1 ulcer. Pyoderma gangrenosum ulcers: usually appear on the legs or chest may also appear around a cut or graze , a stoma (where part of your bowel is brought through an opening made in your tummy), or cuts from surgery may leak fluid On white skin, the pyoderma gangrenosum ulcer will often be blue or purple around the edge.

    "text": "Q fever Q fever is a bacterial infection you can catch from infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle and goats. It's usually harmless, but it can cause serious problems in some people. Symptoms of Q fever Q fever does not always cause symptoms. Some people get flu-like symptoms within 2 to 3 weeks of being infected, such as: a high temperature aching muscles tiredness feeling sick a sore throat swollen glands Symptoms of Q fever usually last up to 2 weeks. How Q fever is spread Q fever is most often spread to humans by close contact with infected farm animals. The bacteria can be spread by contact with: afterbirth (placenta) blood pee poo animal skins, fur and wool The bacteria can spread by being breathed in or through touch. You can also get Q fever from drinking unpasteurised milk (milk that has not been heated to kill bacteria), but this is less likely. Although Q fever is rare, people who work closely with animals are more at risk, such as farmers, vets, stablehands and abattoir workers. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You think you have Q fever and: you're pregnant – Q fever can cause miscarriage and serious complications if it spreads to your baby, especially if you catch it early in pregnancy your immune system is weakened, for example, if you have had an organ transplant or you're having chemotherapy – the infection may affect your eyes or brain you have heart valve disease (where 1 or more of your heart valves are diseased or damaged) Q fever is usually harmless, but in rare cases it can lead to serious problems. Tests for Q fever If a GP thinks you might have Q fever, they can arrange a blood test to see if you have been infected. If you're pregnant and you test positive for Q fever, a GP can refer you for more tests to see if your baby has been infected. This is very rare. Treatment for Q fever from a GP If your Q fever symptoms are severe or they're not getting better, a GP may prescribe a course of antibiotics for 1 or 2 weeks. It's important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better. How to prevent Q fever There is currently no licensed vaccine for Q fever available in the UK. If you work with animals: Do wash your hands regularly clean cuts or grazes immediately and cover them with a plaster or dressing wear protective clothing, such as waterproof gloves and goggles ensure all animal afterbirth (placenta) is cleaned up safely Don’t do not help animals give birth if you're pregnant do not touch anything that has been near animal blood, poo, pee or afterbirth, such as clothes, boots or gloves do not drink milk that has not been heated to kill bacteria (unpasteurised milk) do not eat in areas where animals are kept Important If you're pregnant, it's especially important to avoid contact with sheep and lambs during the lambing season, between January and April. Do not touch anything that has been near sheep or lambs, such as gloves or boots. If you catch Q fever while pregnant, you will usually have no symptoms, so it's better to avoid any risk. There is also a risk of catching toxoplasmosis from sheep and lambs during lambing season. Complications of Q fever In a few people with Q fever, the symptoms can last for months. This is known as chronic Q fever. Chronic Q fever sometimes leads to serious heart problems, such as endocarditis . People with chronic Q fever may need a much longer course of antibiotics and treatment in hospital for any complications that develop.

Find out about other causes and treatments for sore throat symptoms. How long tonsillitis lasts Symptoms of tonsillitis usually go away after 3 to 4 days but can last longer. Tonsillitis is not contagious but most of the infections that cause it are contagious, for example colds and flu. To stop these infections spreading: if you or your child have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your usual activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better use tissues when you cough or sneeze and throw them away wash your hands after coughing or sneezing How to treat tonsillitis yourself Tonsillitis usually gets better on its own after a few days but it can last longer. To help treat the symptoms: get plenty of rest drink cool drinks to soothe the throat take paracetamol or ibuprofen (do not give aspirin to children under 16) gargle with warm salty water (children should not do this) How to gargle with salty water Mix half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and stir until it has dissolved. Gargle with the salty water (do not swallow it), then spit it out. Repeat as often as you like. Young children should not gargle with salty water.

You may also need: a swab test to see if bacteria are causing your tonsillitis (a cotton bud is used to wipe the back of your throat) a blood test for glandular fever if symptoms are severe or will not go away Treatment from a GP for tonsillitis Treatment for tonsillitis will depend on what's causing it: most children and adults get viral tonsillitis (caused by a virus), which clears up on its own for bacterial tonsillitis (caused by bacteria), a GP may prescribe antibiotics A GP will usually wait for the test results to tell which type you have. Important: Surgery to remove your tonsils It's very rare that someone needs to have their tonsils taken out. This is usually only done if you have severe tonsillitis that keeps coming back. Causes of tonsillitis Tonsillitis is usually caused by a virus, such as a cold, but it can also be due to a bacterial infection such as strep throat. Complications of tonsillitis (quinsy) Complications of tonsillitis are very rare. Sometimes you can get an area filled with pus (abscess) between your tonsils and the wall of your throat.

It's almost always fatal once symptoms appear, but vaccination and early treatment can prevent it. Check if you're at risk of rabies Rabies is found throughout the world, but it's very rare in the UK. Although the risk of getting it while travelling is small, rabies is more common in parts of: Asia Africa Central and South America Rabies is spread by mammals, such as dogs, bats, raccoons and foxes. In the UK, it's only found in some bats. You can get rabies if: you're bitten or scratched by an infected animal an infected animal licks your eyes, nose or mouth, or you have a wound that's licked by an infected animal Information: Check your travel risk You can get health advice for a country you're travelling to on the TravelHealthPro website Urgent advice: Get medical help immediately if: you've been bitten or scratched by an animal while you're abroad an animal has licked your eyes, nose or mouth, or licked a wound you have, while you're abroad you've been bitten or scratched by a bat in the UK If you're abroad, get medical help as soon as possible.

    "text": "Reactive arthritis Reactive arthritis is where your joints become sore and swollen after you've had an infection. It usually goes away within 6 months, but it can last longer. Symptoms of reactive arthritis The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually start around 1 to 4 weeks after an infection, such as food poisoning or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Common symptoms of reactive arthritis include: sore, stiff and swollen joints skin around painful joints might feel hot and look red (but redness can be harder to see on black and brown skin) feeling very tired It usually affects knees and feet, but your hands, elbows, spine and tendons around joints might also be affected. Other symptoms can include: mouth ulcers pain when peeing flaky skin, usually on your soles or palms, which might have yellow pus underneath a grey or white patchy rash on your penis sticky, watery eyes ( conjunctivitis ) sore, red eyes with sensitivity to light and blurry vision Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have severe pain and swelling in just 1 joint that started suddenly your pain is not controlled with simple painkillers such as paracetamol skin around your joint feels hot to touch or is red (but redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin) you have sore joints with a high temperature or you feel hot and shivery you have sore joints with conjunctivitis or sore eyes and problems with your vision you have sore joints with pain when you pee, discharge from your penis or vagina, or a rash or sores on your genitals Call 111 or get help from 111 online . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have swollen, painful joints, which is unusual for you How reactive arthritis is diagnosed Reactive arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because several other conditions can have the same symptoms. You'll usually need a range of tests to find out what's causing your symptoms. Tests might include: a blood test tests on a sample of your pee or a swab of your genitals tests on a small amount of fluid removed from a painful joint using a needle (needle biopsy) an X-ray , MRI or ultrasound scan You might be referred to a doctor who specialises in joints and inflammation (a rheumatologist) for tests and treatment. If reactive arthritis is affecting your eyes, you might also be treated by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). If it's affecting your skin, you might also see a skin specialist (dermatologist). Treatment for reactive arthritis Treatment for reactive arthritis might include: medicines that reduce inflammation, such as NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or steroids DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) or biological therapies which reduce inflammation by changing the way your immune system works physical therapy, such as physiotherapy antibiotics, if you still have the infection that may have caused the reactive arthritis Reactive arthritis usually goes away after 6 months. For some people it can come back, or lead to another type of arthritis which needs long-term treatment, such as osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis . Information: Find out more Versus Arthritis: treatment for reactive arthritis Things you can try to help reactive arthritis There are things you can do to ease the symptoms of reactive arthritis. Do get plenty of rest, but try to move around every day to stop your joints getting stiff do stretching and strengthening exercises when your joints are not swollen use cold packs, wrapped in a towel, on sore, swollen joints use heat packs, wrapped in a towel, on sore, stiff muscles take painkillers that are recommended by your doctor follow your care team's advice on what do to if joint pain suddenly gets worse (a flare-up) Causes of reactive arthritis Reactive arthritis can happen after having an infection that's usually in your stomach (such as food poisoning ), or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) , such as chlamydia . Your joints later become swollen because your immune system begins to attack them by mistake. If the infection that causes reactive arthritis was very mild, you might not remember having it before your joint pain began. Page last reviewed: 16 December 2024 Next review due: 16 December 2027"

    "text": "Reflux in babies Reflux is when a baby brings up milk, or is sick, during or shortly after feeding. It's very common and usually gets better on its own. Symptoms of reflux in babies Reflux usually starts before a baby is 8 weeks old and gets better by the time they're 1. Symptoms of reflux in babies include: bringing up milk or being sick during or shortly after feeding coughing or hiccupping when feeding being unsettled during feeding swallowing or gulping after burping or feeding crying and not settling not gaining weight as they're not keeping enough food down Sometimes babies may have signs of reflux but will not bring up milk or be sick. This is known as silent reflux. Things you can try to ease reflux in babies It's common for a baby under the age of 1 to bring up a little bit of milk during or shortly after a feed, without being distressed. Your baby does not usually need to see a doctor if they have reflux, as long as they're happy, healthy and gaining weight. If symptoms of reflux seem to be bothering your baby, there are things you can do to help. Do ask a health visitor for advice and support get advice about your baby's breastfeeding position or how to bottle feed your baby hold your baby upright during feeding and for as long as possible after feeding burp your baby regularly during feeds make sure your baby sleeps flat on their back (they should not sleep on their side or front) Don’t do not raise the head of their cot or Moses basket Non-urgent advice: See a GP if your baby: is not improving after trying things to ease reflux gets reflux for the first time after they're 6 months old is older than 1 and still has reflux is not gaining weight or is losing weight Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if your baby: has vomit that's green or yellow, or has blood in it is projectile vomiting (being sick with more force than usual) has blood in their poo has a swollen or tender tummy has a very high temperature or they feel hot or shivery keeps being sick and cannot keep fluid down has diarrhoea that lasts for over a week or has signs of dehydration will not stop crying and is very distressed is refusing to feed Also call your GP or 111 if you have any other concerns about your baby. Treatment for reflux in babies A GP or specialist may want to check whether your baby has an allergy to cow's milk, because the symptoms can be very similar to reflux. If there's no sign of cow' milk allergy, they may recommend treatments for reflux. If your baby is formula-fed, they may recommend: a powder that's mixed with formula, to thicken it a pre-thickened formula milk If the thickening powder does not help or your baby is breastfed, a GP or specialist might recommend medicines that help with distress from reflux and stop their stomach from producing as much acid. Very rarely, surgery might be needed to strengthen the muscle that stops food or milk travelling back up. This is usually only after trying other things or if their reflux is severe. Causes of reflux Reflux usually happens because the ring of muscle inside your baby's food pipe (oesophagus) can be weak, which allows milk to come back up easily. This muscle will get stronger as your baby gets older and the reflux should stop. Page last reviewed: 10 June 2025 Next review due: 10 June 2028"

    "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of coughs and colds. RSV infections usually get better by themselves, but can sometimes be serious for babies and older adults. Who's at risk from RSV RSV infections are very common. Almost all children get them at least once before they're 2 years old. They're not usually serious, but some babies and adults have a higher risk of getting seriously ill, particularly: babies under 6 months old young children who were born prematurely adults over 75 years babies, children and adults with a weakened immune system, or long-term lung or heart conditions people who smoke tobacco and babies exposed to tobacco smoke In babies, RSV is a common cause of a type of chest infection called bronchiolitis . This can cause breathing problems and may need to be treated in hospital. RSV can also cause a serious lung infection ( pneumonia ) in babies and older adults. How to avoid catching and spreading RSV RSV is spread in the coughs and sneezes of someone who has the virus. There are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting it or spreading it to anyone else, such as: wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly try to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them try to keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they were born prematurely or have serious health conditions Injection for children at risk of serious infections Young children with a very high risk of getting seriously ill from RSV may be given an injection of infection-fighting antibodies each winter. This helps reduce the risk of RSV causing severe bronchiolitis. It's usually given in children's clinics in hospital. RSV vaccination The RSV vaccine is recommended if: you're pregnant (from 28 weeks of pregnancy) – this will help protect your baby for the first few months after they're born you're aged 75 to 79 The vaccine helps reduce the risk of RSV causing serious problems such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Find out more about the RSV vaccine and how to get it Symptoms of an RSV infection Symptoms of an RSV infection usually start within a few days of getting infected. Most people only get cold-like symptoms, such as: a runny or blocked nose a cough sneezing tiredness a high temperature – signs include your back or chest feeling hotter than usual, sweatiness and shivering (chills) Babies with RSV may also be irritable and feed less than usual. If RSV leads to a more serious infection (such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis) it may also cause: a cough that gets worse shortness of breath faster breathing or long gaps between breaths difficulty feeding (in babies) or loss of appetite noisy breathing (wheezing) confusion (in older adults) Information: Cold-like symptoms are very common in babies and children. They're not usually a sign of anything serious and should get better within a few days. But get medical help if you're worried your child is seriously ill. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your child is unwell and it's getting worse your child is feeding or eating much less than normal your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, feels sweaty or is shivering your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher you or a child aged 5 years or older has a temperature below 36C your child is very tired or irritable you get cold symptoms and you have a long-term medical condition (such as a heart or lung condition) or a weakened immune system (for example, because you're having chemotherapy) you have difficulty breathing – you may be more short of breath than usual Check symptoms on 111 online (for anyone aged 5 and over) or call 111 (for children under 5). Information: How to take a temperature If you have a digital thermometer, you can use it to check if you or your child has a high temperature. For more information about how to do this, see: high temperature in children high temperature in adults If you do not have a thermometer, look for signs such as the back or chest feeling hotter than usual, sweatiness and shivering (chills). Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises, long pauses in their breathing or their tummy sucking under their ribs you have severe difficulty breathing – you're gasping, choking or not able to get words out you or your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake you or your child's lips or skin are turning very pale, blue or grey – on brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands your child is under 5 years and has a temperature below 36C As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your judgement. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E if you are unwell. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Treatment for RSV infections There's no specific treatment for an RSV infection. It often gets better on its own in 1 or 2 weeks and you can usually look after yourself or your child at home. Children and adults who get a more serious infection may need to be treated in hospital. Treatment in hospital may include being given fluids to avoid dehydration or oxygen to help you breathe. Things you can do to ease symptoms of an RSV infection If you or your child have mild RSV symptoms, there are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms. Do take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you have a high temperature and are uncomfortable give your child children's paracetamol or children's ibuprofen if they have a high temperature and are uncomfortable – always check the leaflet to make sure it's suitable for your child try using saline nose drops from a pharmacy if your or your child's nose is blocked drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice Don’t do not give aspirin to children under 16 do not smoke around your child – children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting serious RSV infections do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes Page last reviewed: 5 July 2024 Next review due: 5 July 2027"

Most RTIs get better without treatment, but sometimes you may need to see a GP. Symptoms of a respiratory tract infection Symptoms of a respiratory tract infection include: a cough – you may bring up mucus (phlegm) sneezing a stuffy or runny nose a sore throat headaches muscle aches breathlessness, tight chest or wheezing a high temperature feeling generally unwell How to treat a respiratory tract infection yourself Most respiratory tract infections (RTIs) pass within 1 to 2 weeks. You can usually treat your symptoms at home. Do get plenty of rest drink lots of water to loosen any mucus and make it easier to cough up drink a hot lemon and honey drink to help soothe a cough (not suitable for babies under 1 year old) gargle with warm salty water if you have a sore throat (children should not try this) raise your head up while sleeping using extra pillows to make breathing easier and clear your chest of mucus use painkillers to bring down a fever and help ease a sore throat, headaches and muscle pain Don’t do not let children breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water as there's a risk of scalding do not give aspirin to children under 16 do not smoke – it can make your symptoms worse How to make a hot lemon and honey drink Squeeze half a lemon into a mug of boiled water Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey Drink while still warm Do not give hot drinks to small children. How to gargle with salt water Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water – warm water helps salt dissolve Gargle with the solution then spit it out – do not swallow it Repeat as often as you like A pharmacist can help with an RTI A pharmacist can suggest treatments to help relieve your symptoms, such as decongestants and nasal sprays. You can also buy cough medicines and throat lozenges, although there's little evidence to show they help. Some treatments contain paracetamol and ibuprofen . If you're taking these medicines separately, be careful not to take more than the recommended dose. Certain treatments are not suitable for children, babies and pregnant women. Your pharmacist can advise you about the best treatment for you or your child.

Treatment for a respiratory tract infection from a GP Treatment for a respiratory tract infection (RTI) will depend on the cause of your infection. If your RTI is caused by a virus (like the common cold ), it will usually clear up by itself after a few weeks. Antibiotics will not help. If your RTI is caused by bacteria (like pneumonia ), a GP may prescribe antibiotics . Make sure you complete the whole course as advised by a GP, even if you start to feel better. Sometimes a sample of your mucus may need to be tested to see what's causing your RTI. Important: Use of antibiotics Antibiotics are only used to treat bacterial infections. They're not used for treating viral infections because they do not work for this type of infection. How to avoid spreading a respiratory tract infection Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are often spread in the coughs and sneezes of someone with an infection. To reduce the chance of passing an RTI on to others: cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze wash your hands regularly throw away used tissues immediately How to avoid getting a respiratory tract infection If you keep getting respiratory tract infections or you're at a high risk of getting one (for example, because you're over the age of 65 or have a serious long-term health condition), you should: ask a GP about the annual flu vaccine ask if you should have the pneumococcal vaccine – this helps prevent pneumonia stop smoking if you smoke Types of respiratory tract infection There are several different types of respiratory tract infection (RTI). They're usually grouped into upper RTIs and lower RTIs. Upper RTI affect the sinuses and throat. They include: common cold sinusitis (sinus infection) tonsillitis laryngitis Lower RTIs affect the airways and lungs. They include: bronchitis bronchiolitis chest infection pneumonia (lung infection) Flu and COVID-19 can both be upper or lower RTIs. Lower RTIs tend to last longer and can be more serious.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/",
    "text": "Overview - Restless legs syndrome Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system that causes an overwhelming irresistible urge to move the legs. Symptoms of restless legs syndrome The main symptom of restless legs syndrome is an overwhelming urge to move your legs. It can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs. The sensation is often worse in the evening or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected, too. Restless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements (PLM). Some people have the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person's daily activities. What causes restless legs syndrome? In the majority of cases, there's no obvious cause of restless legs syndrome. This is known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families. Some neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and may be responsible for the involuntary leg movements associated with restless legs syndrome. In some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition, such as iron deficiency anaemia or kidney failure. This is known as secondary restless legs syndrome. There's also a link between restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. About 1 in 5 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last 3 months of their pregnancy, although it's not clear exactly why this is. In such cases, restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth. Find out more about the causes of restless legs syndrome Treating restless legs syndrome Mild cases of restless legs syndrome that are not linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes. These include: tips for how to get to sleep (for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night) quitting smoking if you smoke exercising regularly during the daytime If your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron in your body. If restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that's needed to treat the symptoms. Who's affected by restless legs syndrome? Restless legs syndrome is a common condition that can affect anyone at any point in their life. But women are twice as likely to develop restless legs syndrome as men. It's also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood. Outlook The symptoms of restless legs syndrome will usually disappear if it's possible to address an underlying cause. But if the cause is unknown, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with time and severely affect the person's life. Restless legs syndrome is not life threatening, but severe cases can disrupt sleep (causing insomnia ) and trigger anxiety and depression . The charity Restless Leg Syndrome UK (RLS-UK) provides information and support for people affected by restless legs syndrome.

    "title": "Restricted growth (dwarfism)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/restricted-growth/",
    "text": "Restricted growth (dwarfism) Restricted growth, also called dwarfism or short stature, is when you are shorter than most people. It has many different causes. Treatment depends on what's causing it. Information: This information is about restricted growth in children and adults, not about having a small baby. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have more information about having a small baby Symptoms of restricted growth The main symptom of restricted growth is being short. It's sometimes defined as being less than 147 centimetres (4 feet 10 inches) tall as an adult. Restricted growth can be: proportionate, where your arms and legs are the expected size compared to the rest of your body disproportionate, where parts of your body grow differently (for example, having short arms and legs compared to the rest of your body) Symptoms of restricted growth might be noticed when a baby is born, or later when a child is not growing as expected for their age. You or your child may also have other symptoms, depending on what's causing the restricted growth. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your child is not growing as expected for their age Causes of restricted growth Restricted growth is usually genetic, meaning it is caused by the genes passed on from your parents. This can just be because your parents are short themselves, or because of a genetic condition. Restricted growth can also be caused by hormone deficiencies or poor diet (malnutrition). Causes of restricted growth include: a lack of the hormone that controls growth (growth hormone deficiency) rare genetic conditions such as Turner syndrome , Noonan syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome problems affecting bone development (skeletal dysplasias), such as achondroplasia How restricted growth is diagnosed Restricted growth is often diagnosed when a baby is born. Sometimes it's not diagnosed until later, when a child is not growing as expected for their age. If a doctor thinks you or your child may have restricted growth, they may recommend tests such as: blood tests genetic tests X-rays Screening in pregnancy If you're more likely to have a baby with restricted growth, for example because you or someone in your family has a genetic condition, you may be offered screening tests before you give birth. Treatment for restricted growth The main treatment for restricted growth is growth hormone medicine. Surgery to increase the length of your arms or legs is sometimes done, but this is rare. You may also need treatment for other symptoms of your condition. Growth hormone Growth hormone is used to increase height in children with restricted growth, or children who are not growing as expected for their age. It can treat many different types of restricted growth, but it is not normally used to treat a problem with bone development (such as achondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias). Growth hormone medicines include: somatropin – a daily injection used to treat many causes of restricted growth somatrogon – a weekly injection, only used if you have a lack of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency) How well treatment works depends on what's causing the restricted growth. Treatment usually continues until your child stops growing or reaches their target height. Treatment for skeletal dysplasias If you have a skeletal dysplasia such as achondroplasia, treatment usually aims to relieve any other symptoms you have, rather than increase your height. Treatments you may need include: physiotherapy for problems with movement and pain orthodontics for problems with your teeth treatment for ear infections and sleep apnoea surgery, for example to straighten bowed legs, or to straighten or reduce pressure on your spine How restricted growth affects your life How restricted growth affects your life depends on what causes it, what other symptoms you have, and your treatment. With treatment, some people with restricted growth conditions reach an average or close to average adult height. But others will be significantly below average height as an adult. Most people with restricted growth conditions have an average life expectancy. But some restricted growth conditions can affect how long you live. Everyday life with restricted growth If you're much shorter than most people, you may need adaptations to help you with: doing everyday activities at home getting around and driving accessing education and work finding clothes that fit taking part in sports and other activities Depending on how your condition affects you, you may be eligible for disability benefits to help with the costs of adaptations and support.

    "text": "Detached retina (retinal detachment) A detached retina is when the thin layer at the back of your eye (retina) becomes loose. It needs to be treated quickly to stop it permanently affecting your sight. Symptoms of a detached retina Symptoms of a detached retina include: floaters (dots and lines) or flashes of light in your eye a dark \"curtain\" or shadow in your vision changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if: floaters (dots and lines) suddenly appear in your vision or suddenly increase in number you get flashes of light in your vision you have a dark \"curtain\" or shadow moving across your vision your vision gets suddenly blurred You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment for a detached retina You'll be referred to hospital for surgery if tests show your retina may be detached or has started to come away (retinal tear). Surgery will usually stop your vision getting worse. What happens during surgery for a detached retina or tear Surgery to re-attach the retina or fix a retinal tear may involve: removing and replacing the jelly inside your eye (vitrectomy) attaching a small band around your eye to push the wall of your eye and retina closer together (scleral buckling) injecting a bubble of gas into your eye to push the retina against the back of your eye (pneumatic retinopexy) sealing the tear in your retina with laser or freezing treatment (cryotherapy) It's usually done with local anaesthetic, so you're awake but your eye is numbed. You do not normally need to stay in hospital overnight. You may be asked to lie or sit in a particular position for up to 7 days after the surgery. This is so that your retina is in the correct position to help it heal. Recovering from a detached retina Recovery time after surgery for a detached retina varies. But as a general guide, for 2 to 6 weeks after surgery: your vision may be blurry your eye may be sore and red – take paracetamol if you need to you may need to take time off work you may not be able to drive you may need to avoid flying (if you've had a bubble of gas put into your eye) Most people are eventually able to return to all their normal activities. Important Call the hospital or go to A&E if the pain, redness or blurriness gets worse after surgery. You may need further treatment. Causes of a detached retina A detached retina is usually caused by changes to the jelly inside your eye, which can happen as you get older. This is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). It's not clear exactly why PVD can lead to retinal detachment in some people and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. But it's more likely to happen if you: are short-sighted have had an eye operation (such as cataract surgery) have had an eye injury have a family history of retinal detachment Find out more about posterior vitreous detachment from RNIB Important: If your symptoms come back You can get a detached retina more than once. Get medical help as soon as possible if the symptoms come back. Page last reviewed: 04 August 2023 Next review due: 04 August 2026"

    "title": "Rett syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rett-syndrome/",
    "text": "Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development, resulting in severe mental and physical disability. It's estimated to affect around 1 in 10,000 girls born each year and is only rarely seen in boys. Signs and symptoms Some children with Rett syndrome are affected more severely than others. Also, the age at which symptoms first appear varies from child to child. A child may not have all the symptoms of Rett syndrome, and their symptoms might change as they get older. Rett syndrome is described in 4 stages, although symptoms will often overlap between each stage. These are the main features of each stage: Stage 1: early signs At first, the child will appear to develop and grow normally for at least 6 months. There may be subtle signs of Rett syndrome before the child is recognised as having a problem (especially with hindsight). Stage 1 is sometimes described as \"stagnation\". Symptoms include: low muscle tone (hypotonia) difficulty feeding unusual, repetitive hand movements or jerky limb movements delay with development of speech mobility problems, such as problems sitting, crawling and walking lack of interest in toys These symptoms typically begin from 6 to 18 months and often last for several months, although they can persist for a year or more. Stage 1 can often go unnoticed because the changes occur gradually and may be subtle. Stage 2: regression During stage 2, known as \"regression\" or the \"rapid destructive stage\", the child starts to lose some of their abilities. This stage usually begins between the ages of 1 and 4 and may last for any time from 2 months to more than 2 years. The child will gradually or suddenly start to develop severe problems with communication and language, memory, mobility, co-ordination and other brain functions. Some of the characteristics and behaviours are similar to those of autism . Signs at this stage include: loss of the ability to use the hands purposefully – repetitive hand movements are often difficult to control and include wringing, washing, clapping or tapping periods of distress, irritability and sometimes screaming for no obvious reason social withdrawal – a loss of interest in people and avoidance of eye contact unsteadiness and awkwardness when walking problems sleeping slowing of head growth difficulty eating, chewing or swallowing, and sometimes constipation that may cause stomach aches problems with heart rate or heart rhythm Later on during regression, the child may experience periods of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) or slow breathing, including breath-holding . They may also swallow air which can lead to abdominal bloating. Stage 3: plateau Stage 3 of Rett syndrome can begin as early as 2 years or as late as 10 years. It often lasts for many years, with many children remaining in this stage for most of their lives. During stage 3, some of the stage 2 symptoms may get better – for example, there may be improvements in behaviour, with less irritability and crying. The child may become more interested in people and their surroundings, and there may be improvements in alertness, attention span and communication. Their walking may also improve (or they may learn to walk, if they could not before). Other symptoms at this stage include: seizures irregular breathing patterns may get worse – for example, shallow breathing followed by rapid, deep breathing, or breath-holding Gaining and maintaining weight can also be difficult to achieve. Stage 4: deterioration in movement Stage 4 can last for years or even decades. The main symptoms at this stage are: development of a spinal curve (the spine bending to the left or right side), known as scoliosis . This is more likely from the age of 6 years, and the risk reduces after puberty muscle weakness and spasticity (abnormal stiffness, particularly in the legs) losing the ability to walk Communication, language skills and brain function do not tend to get any worse during stage 4. The repetitive hand movements may decrease and eye gaze usually improves. Seizures also usually become less of a problem during teenage and early adult life, although they will often be a lifelong problem to manage. What causes Rett syndrome? Almost all cases of Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation (a change in the DNA) in the MECP2 gene, which is found on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes). The MECP2 gene contains instructions for producing a particular protein (MeCP2), which is needed for brain development. The gene abnormality prevents nerve cells in the brain from working properly. There's usually no family history of Rett syndrome, which means it's not passed on from one generation to the next. Almost all cases (over 99%) are spontaneous, with the mutation occurring randomly. Diagnosing Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is usually diagnosed based on your child's symptoms, and by ruling out other more common disorders. A diagnosis of Rett syndrome may not be made straight away because the syndrome is so rare, and symptoms do not tend to appear until a child is between 6 and 18 months old. A genetic blood test can be used to identify if the genetic mutation is responsible for Rett syndrome. If a change is found in the MECP2 gene, it can help confirm the diagnosis, but failing to find it does not necessarily rule out the syndrome. Read more about genetic testing . Managing Rett syndrome There's no cure for Rett syndrome, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms. As a parent caring for a child with the syndrome, it's likely you'll need help and support from a wide range of healthcare professionals. Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids: speech and language therapy, picture boards, eye gaze technology and other visual aids to help with communication, or ways to help them communicate such as Signalong, Makaton or PECS medicine for breathing and mobility problems, and anti-epileptic medicine to control seizures physiotherapy , attention to mobility, careful attention to your child's sitting posture (to minimise the chances of scoliosis developing), and frequent changes in posture if scoliosis does become established, a back brace and sometimes spinal surgery may be used to prevent the spine curving further (read more about treating scoliosis ) a high-calorie, low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet to help maintain sufficient weight and help control seizures, with the use of a feeding tube and other feeding aids if necessary occupational therapy to help develop the skills needed for dressing, feeding and other daily activities an ankle-foot orthosis (lower leg brace) to help them walk independently a hand splint to help control severe hand movements (they're mainly used for limited periods to prevent self-injury or to encourage activities with the other hand) Therapeutic horse riding, swimming, hydrotherapy and music therapy have also been reported to be beneficial. Ask your healthcare team where you can access these therapies. From the age of 14, people with Rett syndrome should have checks with their GP at least once a year. Read more about caring for a disabled child and care equipment, aids and adaptations . Outlook Although some people with Rett syndrome may retain a degree of hand control, walking ability and communication skills, most will be dependent on 24-hour care throughout their lives. Many people with Rett syndrome reach adulthood, and those who are less severely affected can live into old age. However, some people die at a fairly young age as a result of complications, such as heart rhythm abnormalities, pneumonia and epilepsy . Advice for carers Caring for a child with Rett syndrome is mentally and physically challenging. Most carers will need social and psychological support. The social care and support guide provides lots of information and advice about how you can take time to look after yourself, including: getting a break from caring benefits for carers Rett UK is a charity providing help and support for people living with Rett syndrome. Their helpline number is 01582 798911, and you can also contact them by email: support@rettuk.org Find out more about living with Rett syndrome on the Reverse Rett website Page last reviewed: 17 March 2023 Next review due: 17 March 2026"

    "text": "Reye's syndrome Reye's syndrome is a very rare condition that can affect children or young adults after they've had an illness like flu or chickenpox. It can cause serious brain problems if it's not treated quickly. Symptoms of Reye's syndrome Symptoms of Reye's syndrome often start 1 to 3 weeks after a child recovers from a virus like flu or chickenpox. The child may: keep being sick (vomiting) be drowsy and lack energy feel confused have changes in their behaviour, such as being irritable or aggressive breathe quickly and have a fast heart rate have fits (seizures) lose consciousness Reye's syndrome most commonly affects children between 5 and 14 years of age. Younger and older children can also sometimes get it, but it's very rare in babies under the age of 1 and in those over the age of 18. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if your child: has a fit or seizure is finding it difficult to breathe is confused is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face) loses consciousness Find your nearest A&E Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your child keeps being sick (vomiting) your child is drowsy or lacks energy your child is not their normal self – for example, they're irritable or aggressive Check symptoms on 111 online (for children aged 5 or over) or call 111 (for children under 5). Tell the GP or person you speak to if your child has recently had an infection like flu or chickenpox and if they've taken aspirin. What happens at your appointment If there's a chance your child might have Reye's syndrome, they'll be referred to a specialist for some tests. Tests may include: blood and urine tests a CT scan and an electroencephalogram (EEG) a lumbar puncture – where a thin needle is inserted into their lower back to remove a small amount of spinal fluid for testing a liver biopsy – where a small sample of cells from the liver is taken for testing Treatments for Reye's syndrome If your child has Reye's syndrome, they'll need to go into hospital straight away for treatment. Treatments for Reye's syndrome may include: help with breathing using an oxygen machine fluids given directly into a vein to help prevent dehydration medicines to help treat and manage symptoms Most children with Reye's syndrome make a full recovery if it's treated quickly. But some children can have long-term brain problems. Causes of Reye's syndrome The exact cause of Reye's syndrome is unknown. It's been linked to the use of a type of medicine known as salicylates, particularly aspirin, in young people and children under 16. Sometimes a child with a rare genetic condition, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) , can get Reye's syndrome. This has nothing to do with the use of aspirin. Preventing Reye's syndrome There are things you can do to reduce your child's chance of getting Reye's syndrome. Do think about getting your child vaccinated against flu and other common viruses Don’t do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16, unless their doctor prescribes it do not give children under 16 any medicines that contain salicylic acid or salicylate, which includes some mouth ulcer gels – ask a pharmacist for advice about alternatives suitable for children Page last reviewed: 14 September 2023 Next review due: 14 September 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Rhesus disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Prevention Rhesus disease is a condition where antibodies in a pregnant woman's blood destroy her baby's blood cells. It's also known as haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn (HDFN). Rhesus disease doesn't harm the mother, but it can cause the baby to become anaemic and develop newborn jaundice . Read about the symptoms of rhesus disease in a baby . What causes rhesus disease? Rhesus disease only happens when the mother has rhesus negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus positive blood (RhD positive). The mother must have also been previously sensitised to RhD positive blood. Sensitisation happens when a woman with RhD negative blood is exposed to RhD positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an RhD positive baby. The woman’s body responds to the RhD positive blood by producing antibodies (infection-fighting molecules) that recognise the foreign blood cells and destroy them. If sensitisation occurs, the next time the woman is exposed to RhD positive blood, her body produces antibodies immediately. If she's pregnant with an RhD positive baby, the antibodies can cross the placenta, causing rhesus disease in the unborn baby. The antibodies can continue attacking the baby's red blood cells for a few months after birth. Read more about the causes of rhesus disease . Preventing rhesus disease Rhesus disease is uncommon these days because it can usually be prevented using injections of a medication called anti-D immunoglobulin. All women are offered blood tests as part of their antenatal checks and tests to determine whether their blood is RhD negative or positive. If the mother is RhD negative, she'll be offered injections of anti-D immunoglobulin at certain points in her pregnancy when she may be exposed to the baby's red blood cells. This anti-D immunoglobulin helps to remove the RhD foetal blood cells before they can cause sensitisation. If a woman has developed anti-D antibodies in a previous pregnancy (she's already sensitised) then these immunoglobulin injections don't help. The pregnancy will be monitored more closely than usual, as will the baby after delivery. Read more about preventing rhesus disease and diagnosing rhesus disease . Treating rhesus disease If an unborn baby does develop rhesus disease, treatment depends on how severe it is. A blood transfusion to the unborn baby may be needed in more severe cases. After delivery, the child is likely to be admitted to a neonatal unit (a hospital unit that specialises in caring for newborn babies). Treatment for rhesus disease after delivery can include a light treatment called phototherapy, blood transfusions, and an injection of a solution of antibodies (intravenous immunoglobulin) to prevent red blood cells being destroyed. If rhesus disease is left untreated, severe cases can lead to stillbirth . In other cases, it could lead to brain damage, learning difficulties, hearing loss and blindness and vision loss . However, treatment is usually effective and these problems are uncommon. Read more about treating rhesus disease and the potential complications of rhesus disease .

    "text": "Rheumatic fever Rheumatic fever is a very rare complication that can develop after a bacterial throat infection. It mainly affects children, and can cause painful joints and heart problems. Most people make a full recovery, but it can come back. How rheumatic fever is treated If you or your child are diagnosed with rheumatic fever, you'll have treatment to relieve the symptoms and control inflammation. You may need: antibiotics painkillers – given as tablets, capsules or a liquid you drink steroids – if your pain is severe medicines to treat severe jerky, uncontrollable movements Getting plenty of bed rest will also help with your recovery. Information: Most people usually make a full recovery by about 3 months. But it can sometimes take longer to get better. Ongoing treatment for rheumatic fever If you've had rheumatic fever once, it's more likely to come back, so make sure to get sore throats treated early. You may also have to take antibiotics for several years to help stop it returning. It's less likely that it will come back if it's been 5 years since you last had an episode. The younger you are, the more likely it is that rheumatic fever will come back. It can also cause permanent damage to your heart (rheumatic heart disease). This can take years to show up, so you may need regular check-ups and further treatment when you're older. Always ask a doctor what ongoing treatment you may need. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you've had rheumatic fever before and you get a sore throat you've had rheumatic fever before and you think it's come back you've had a bacterial throat infection recently and you get symptoms of rheumatic fever Symptoms of rheumatic fever Symptoms of rheumatic fever usually appear 1 to 5 weeks after you've had a bacterial throat infection. They can include: a high temperature pain and swelling in your joints (arthritis), usually ankles, knees, wrists or elbows – your joints may also look red, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin pain in your chest, breathlessness and a fast heart rate jerky, uncontrollable movements in your hands, feet and face tiny bumps under your skin pale-red patches on your arms and tummy (abdomen) – these may be harder to see on brown or black skin Causes of rheumatic fever Rheumatic fever happens after a bacterial throat or skin infection. Most people who have an infection will not get rheumatic fever. It's not caused by the bacteria itself but by your immune system fighting off the infection and attacking the healthy tissue instead. It's not known why your immune system can suddenly stop working properly. But your genes may make it more likely that you'll get rheumatic fever.

    "text": "Allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is where your nose gets irritated by something you're allergic to, such as pollen, causing sneezing and other symptoms. For most people it's easy to treat with medicines from a pharmacist. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis Common symptoms of allergic rhinitis are similar to a cold and include: sneezing an itchy nose a runny or blocked nose itchy, red and watery eyes a cough the roof of your mouth being itchy This usually happens within minutes of coming into contact with something you're allergic to. Causes of allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction. Common allergies include: pollen from trees, grass and weeds ( hay fever ) house dust mites animals such as dogs and cats mould wood dust, flour dust and latex You're more likely to get an allergy if people in your family also have them or conditions such as eczema and asthma . Information: Allergic rhinitis is different from non-allergic rhinitis , which is caused by things like having a cold, very hot or cold temperatures and humidity. How you can treat allergic rhinitis yourself You can often treat allergic rhinitis without seeing a GP. If you can, try to avoid the things that trigger your allergies. A pharmacist can also advise you about medicines that can help, such as: antihistamines decongestant nasal sprays or drops to unblock your nose (decongestants should not be used by children under 6) salt water nasal sprays or solutions to rinse out the inside of your nose You can buy nasal sprays without a prescription, but they should not be used for more than a week as this can make your symptoms worse. Find a pharmacy How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution Boil a pint of water, then leave it to cool. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water. Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it. Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat. Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day (making a new solution each time) until your nose feels more comfortable. If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have allergic rhinitis and your symptoms get worse you also have asthma and it's getting worse your symptoms are affecting your sleep and everyday life you're not sure what's causing your symptoms treatments from a pharmacist are not working Treatments for allergic rhinitis from a GP If pharmacy medicines do not help ease your allergic rhinitis symptoms, a GP may prescribe a different medicine, such as prescription steroid nasal sprays or antihistamines . You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment if it's not clear what's causing your symptoms or they're severe. Preventing allergic rhinitis If you have allergic rhinitis, it's not always possible to avoid the things you're allergic to. But there are steps you can take to try to help reduce your symptoms. Do wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen use hypoallergenic bedding and covers, and wash bedding regularly at 60C and above dust with a damp cloth and use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wash pets at least once every 2 weeks and groom them outside regularly regularly wash your pet's bedding and clean any furniture they've been on keep your home dry and well-ventilated, and deal with any damp and condensation Don’t do not allow pets in bedrooms do not go outside or dry clothes outside when the pollen count is high, if possible Information: Find out more Allergy UK: living with an allergy Page last reviewed: 30 May 2022 Next review due: 30 May 2025"

    "text": "Overview - Rickets and osteomalacia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Prevention Rickets is a condition that affects bone development in children. It causes bone pain, poor growth and soft, weak bones that can lead to bone deformities. Adults can experience a similar condition, which is known as osteomalacia or soft bones. Read more about the signs and symptoms of rickets and osteomalacia . What causes rickets? A lack of vitamin D or calcium is the most common cause of rickets. Vitamin D largely comes from exposing the skin to sunlight, but it's also found in some foods, such as oily fish and eggs. Vitamin D is essential for the formation of strong and healthy bones in children. In rare cases, children can be born with a genetic form of rickets. It can also develop if another condition affects how vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body. Read more about the causes of rickets . Who's affected? Rickets was common in the past, but it mostly disappeared in the western world during the early 20th century after foods like margarine and cereal were fortified with vitamin D. However, in recent years, there's been an increase in cases of rickets in the UK. The number of rickets cases is still relatively small, but studies have shown a significant number of people in the UK have low levels of vitamin D in their blood. Any child who doesn't get enough vitamin D or calcium either through their diet, or from sunlight, can develop rickets. But the condition is more common in children with dark skin, as this means they need more sunlight to get enough vitamin D, as well as children born prematurely or taking medication that interferes with vitamin D. Treating rickets For most children, rickets can be successfully treated by ensuring they eat foods that contain calcium and vitamin D, or by taking vitamin supplements. Some families are eligible for free vitamin supplements from the government's Healthy Start scheme – find out if you're eligible and how to apply . If your child has problems absorbing vitamins and minerals, they may need a higher supplement dose or a yearly vitamin D injection. Read more about treating rickets . Preventing rickets Rickets can easily be prevented by eating a diet that includes vitamin D and calcium, spending some time in sunlight, and if necessary, taking vitamin D supplements. Read more about: preventing rickets who should take vitamin D supplements how much vitamin D adults, children and babies need When to seek medical advice Take your child to see your GP if they have any of the signs and symptoms of rickets . Your GP will carry out a physical examination to check for any obvious problems. They may also discuss your child's medical history, diet, family history, and any medication they're taking. A blood test can usually confirm a diagnosis of rickets, although your child may also have some X-rays or possibly a bone density scan (DEXA scan) . This is a type of X-ray that measures the calcium content in bones. If you're an adult and you’re experiencing bone pain or muscle weakness you should also see your GP to get it checked out.

The infection should pass within a week. Do let your child rest if they feel unwell make sure they drink lots of fluids give them children's paracetamol or children's ibuprofen if a high temperature makes them feel uncomfortable – check the dose on the bottle keep your child at home while they have a high temperature –. this is when roseola is thought to be most contagious Don’t do not cover them up in too many clothes or bedclothes do not give aspirin to under-16s do not combine ibuprofen and paracetamol, unless a GP tells you to do not give paracetamol to a child under 2 months do not give ibuprofen to a child under 3 months or under 5kg do not give ibuprofen to children with asthma Once the high temperature has passed, you do not need to keep your child away from nursery if they're feeling well enough to attend. There's no need to wait until the rash disappears.

    "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of coughs and colds. RSV infections usually get better by themselves, but can sometimes be serious for babies and older adults. Who's at risk from RSV RSV infections are very common. Almost all children get them at least once before they're 2 years old. They're not usually serious, but some babies and adults have a higher risk of getting seriously ill, particularly: babies under 6 months old young children who were born prematurely adults over 75 years babies, children and adults with a weakened immune system, or long-term lung or heart conditions people who smoke tobacco and babies exposed to tobacco smoke In babies, RSV is a common cause of a type of chest infection called bronchiolitis . This can cause breathing problems and may need to be treated in hospital. RSV can also cause a serious lung infection ( pneumonia ) in babies and older adults. How to avoid catching and spreading RSV RSV is spread in the coughs and sneezes of someone who has the virus. There are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting it or spreading it to anyone else, such as: wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly try to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them try to keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they were born prematurely or have serious health conditions Injection for children at risk of serious infections Young children with a very high risk of getting seriously ill from RSV may be given an injection of infection-fighting antibodies each winter. This helps reduce the risk of RSV causing severe bronchiolitis. It's usually given in children's clinics in hospital. RSV vaccination The RSV vaccine is recommended if: you're pregnant (from 28 weeks of pregnancy) – this will help protect your baby for the first few months after they're born you're aged 75 to 79 The vaccine helps reduce the risk of RSV causing serious problems such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Find out more about the RSV vaccine and how to get it Symptoms of an RSV infection Symptoms of an RSV infection usually start within a few days of getting infected. Most people only get cold-like symptoms, such as: a runny or blocked nose a cough sneezing tiredness a high temperature – signs include your back or chest feeling hotter than usual, sweatiness and shivering (chills) Babies with RSV may also be irritable and feed less than usual. If RSV leads to a more serious infection (such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis) it may also cause: a cough that gets worse shortness of breath faster breathing or long gaps between breaths difficulty feeding (in babies) or loss of appetite noisy breathing (wheezing) confusion (in older adults) Information: Cold-like symptoms are very common in babies and children. They're not usually a sign of anything serious and should get better within a few days. But get medical help if you're worried your child is seriously ill. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your child is unwell and it's getting worse your child is feeding or eating much less than normal your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, feels sweaty or is shivering your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher you or a child aged 5 years or older has a temperature below 36C your child is very tired or irritable you get cold symptoms and you have a long-term medical condition (such as a heart or lung condition) or a weakened immune system (for example, because you're having chemotherapy) you have difficulty breathing – you may be more short of breath than usual Check symptoms on 111 online (for anyone aged 5 and over) or call 111 (for children under 5). Information: How to take a temperature If you have a digital thermometer, you can use it to check if you or your child has a high temperature. For more information about how to do this, see: high temperature in children high temperature in adults If you do not have a thermometer, look for signs such as the back or chest feeling hotter than usual, sweatiness and shivering (chills). Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises, long pauses in their breathing or their tummy sucking under their ribs you have severe difficulty breathing – you're gasping, choking or not able to get words out you or your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake you or your child's lips or skin are turning very pale, blue or grey – on brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands your child is under 5 years and has a temperature below 36C As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your judgement. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E if you are unwell. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Treatment for RSV infections There's no specific treatment for an RSV infection. It often gets better on its own in 1 or 2 weeks and you can usually look after yourself or your child at home. Children and adults who get a more serious infection may need to be treated in hospital. Treatment in hospital may include being given fluids to avoid dehydration or oxygen to help you breathe. Things you can do to ease symptoms of an RSV infection If you or your child have mild RSV symptoms, there are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms. Do take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you have a high temperature and are uncomfortable give your child children's paracetamol or children's ibuprofen if they have a high temperature and are uncomfortable – always check the leaflet to make sure it's suitable for your child try using saline nose drops from a pharmacy if your or your child's nose is blocked drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice Don’t do not give aspirin to children under 16 do not smoke around your child – children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting serious RSV infections do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes Page last reviewed: 5 July 2024 Next review due: 5 July 2027"

Salivary gland stones are white and hard. Credit: CLINICA CLAROS/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/643969/view They vary in size, but most are as big as a pea. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/81080/view Salivary gland stones may cause: dull pain in your mouth that comes and goes swelling in your mouth that flares up from time to time an infection around the stone – signs of infection include pain, redness and a high temperature If you feel intense pain during mealtimes, this could mean the stone is completely blocking a saliva gland. The pain usually lasts 1 to 2 hours. Things you can do to try to remove salivary gland stones You can try to remove a salivary gland stone by doing things to increase the amount of saliva in your mouth, such as: sucking on a lemon or lemon drops drinking plenty of water gently massaging around the stone If you have pain and swelling, you can: take paracetamol or ibuprofen suck ice cubes or ice lollies The symptoms will not go away until the stone has been removed. Important Do not use anything sharp to try to remove a salivary gland stone because it could cause injury and infection. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you're unable to remove a salivary gland stone yourself the stone has caused an infection – signs include pain, redness or pus around the stone, and having a high temperature (you feel hot and shivery) Treatments for salivary gland stones Small salivary gland stones sometimes fall out on their own. You’ll continue to have symptoms until the stone falls out or is removed. A GP may attempt to gently remove the stone with a thin, blunt instrument. If that's not possible, you may need to have the stone removed in hospital. Causes of salivary gland stones It's not clear what causes salivary gland stones, so there's no way to prevent them. They're not usually linked to other health problems. Once removed, salivary gland stones do not usually come back. But if you keep getting them you might need to have 1 of your salivary glands removed. Page last reviewed: 14 August 2023 Next review due: 14 August 2026"

    "text": "Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a rare condition that causes small patches of swollen tissue, called granulomas, to develop in the organs of the body. It often affects the lungs and lymph nodes, and can also affect your skin. The symptoms of sarcoidosis depend on which organs are affected, but typically include: tender bumps on the skin shortness of breath a persistent cough For many people with sarcoidosis, symptoms often improve without treatment within a few months or years. In these cases, the symptoms are not usually severe. However, some people find their symptoms develop gradually and get worse over time, to the point where their health becomes severely affected. This is known as chronic sarcoidosis. There is currently no cure but symptoms can usually be managed with medicine. Symptoms of sarcoidosis It's impossible to predict how sarcoidosis will affect a person, as the condition can affect any organ and the symptoms vary widely depending on which organs are involved. Most people with sarcoidosis develop symptoms suddenly, but these usually clear within a few months or years and the condition does not come back. This is known as acute sarcoidosis. Some people do not have any symptoms at all, and the condition is diagnosed after an X-ray carried out for another reason. A few people find their symptoms develop gradually and get worse over time, to the point where they become severely affected. Lots of granulomas may form in an organ and prevent it from working properly. This is known as chronic sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs, skin and lymph nodes (glands). Lung symptoms The lungs are affected in about 9 out of 10 of people with sarcoidosis. This is known as pulmonary sarcoidosis. The main symptoms are shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. Some people with pulmonary sarcoidosis experience pain and discomfort in their chest, but this is uncommon. Skin symptoms Credit: CNRI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/262539/view The skin is also affected in many people with sarcoidosis. This can cause tender bumps or patches to develop on the skin (particularly the lower legs and arms), as well as bumps on the upper body. These can be reddish-brown or purple, depending on your skin colour and the type of sarcoidosis you have. Other symptoms If other organs are affected, you may also have some of the following symptoms: tender and swollen glands in the face, neck, armpits or groin tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell painful joints red or sore eyes an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) a blocked or stuffy nose pain in the bones kidney stones headache Causes of sarcoidosis The exact cause of sarcoidosis is not known. Possible causes include: exposure to substances in the environment – such as mould, wood stoves, soil, tree pollen, insecticides, silica and other substances viral or bacterial infections genetics – as sarcoidosis is more common in certain groups of people, such as African-Americans, and in certain areas of the world, such as Scandinavia the body’s immune system attacking its own tissues and organs (autoimmunity) Sarcoidosis can occasionally occur in more than one family member, but there's no evidence that the condition is inherited. The condition is not infectious, so it cannot be passed from person to person. Who's affected Sarcoidosis can affect people of any age, but usually starts in adults aged between 30 and 40. It's rare in childhood. The condition affects people from all ethnic backgrounds. It's also more common in women than men. Diagnosing sarcoidosis A number of different tests may be carried out to diagnose sarcoidosis, depending on which organs are affected. If your symptoms suggest you have pulmonary sarcoidosis (sarcoidosis affecting the lungs), you may have a chest X-ray or a CT scan of your lungs to look for signs of the condition. In some cases, doctors may want to examine the inside of your lungs using a long, thin, flexible tube with a light source and a camera at the end (an endoscope ) that's passed down your throat. A small sample of lung tissue may also be removed during this test so it can be studied under a microscope. This is known as a biopsy . If doctors think you may have sarcoidosis affecting other organs – such as the skin, heart or eyes – scans or examinations of these areas will usually be carried out. How sarcoidosis is treated Many people with sarcoidosis do not need treatment as the condition often goes away on its own, usually within a few months or years. In this case, simple lifestyle changes and over-the-counter painkillers (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen ) are often all that's needed to control the pain of any flare-ups. Doctors will monitor your condition to check if it's getting any better or worse without treatment. This can be done with regular X-rays, breathing tests and blood tests . Medicines If treatment is recommended, steroid tablets are usually used. This helps relieve symptoms and prevent damage to affected organs by reducing inflammation and preventing scarring. However, steroid tablets can cause side effects such as weight gain and mood swings if taken in high doses. Other side effects, such as weakening of the bones ( osteoporosis ), can also develop if steroids are taken for a long time. Therefore, they're only used when necessary. You may initially be given a high dose of steroid medicine for a short period of time, before switching to a low dose for the months or years that follow. Your condition will be monitored during this time to see how well the treatment is working. In some cases, taking calcium or vitamin D supplements can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis caused by long-term use of steroid medicine. However, you should only take these if advised to by a doctor. Some people with sarcoidosis may have an increased risk of developing complications, including kidney stones, while taking steroid medicine. Other medicines may sometimes be used if steroids are not enough or there are concerns about side effects. In these cases, a medicine called an immunosuppressant might be recommended. This may help to improve your symptoms by reducing the activity of your immune system. Living with sarcoidosis The following lifestyle measures may help if you have sarcoidosis: stop smoking, if you smoke eat a balanced diet maintain a healthy weight try to reduce stress get regular exercise get enough sleep Find a support group on the Sarcoidosis UK website Outlook Symptoms of sarcoidosis may come and go, and can often be managed with over-the-counter painkillers so they do not affect everyday life. Most people with the condition find their symptoms have disappeared within a few years of their diagnosis. However, for some people the condition slowly gets worse over time and they end up with organ damage. For example, their lungs may stop working properly, causing increasing breathlessness. Help is available for people with severe, persistent sarcoidosis. Ask your doctor for advice and visit the Sarcoidosis UK website (which has a list of support groups) or the Asthma + Lung UK website . Information about you If you have sarcoidosis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

It often affects skin between the fingers, around the wrists, under the arms, and around the waist, groin and bottom. However, older people and young children may develop a rash on their head, neck, palms and soles of their feet. People with a weakened immune system can sometimes get a rare and very contagious type of scabies called crusted scabies. The main symptom is a crusted, flaky rash that often affects the elbows, knees, hands and feet. If you're not sure it's scabies Many other things can cause itchy skin and rashes in babies and children .

    "title": "Schistosomiasis (bilharzia)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/schistosomiasis/",
    "text": "Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is an infection caused by a parasitic worm that lives in fresh water in subtropical and tropical regions. The parasite is most commonly found throughout Africa, but also lives in parts of South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia. Travel Health Pro has a map of where schistosomiasis is found You often don't have any symptoms when you first become infected with schistosomiasis, but the parasite can remain in the body for many years and cause damage to organs such as the bladder, kidneys and liver. The infection can be easily treated with a short course of medicine, so see your GP if you think you might have it. How you get schistosomiasis The worms that cause schistosomiasis live in fresh water, such as: ponds lakes rivers reservoirs canals Showers that take unfiltered water directly from lakes or rivers may also spread the infection, but the worms aren't found in the sea, chlorinated swimming pools or properly treated water supplies. You can become infected if you come into contact with contaminated water – for example, when paddling, swimming or washing – and the tiny worms burrow into your skin. Once in your body, the worms move through your blood to areas such as the liver and bowel. After a few weeks, the worms start to lay eggs. Some eggs remain inside the body and are attacked by the immune system, while some are passed out in the person's pee or poo. Without treatment, the worms can keep laying eggs for several years. If the eggs pass out of the body into water, they release tiny larvae that need to grow inside freshwater snails for a few weeks before they're able to infect another person. This means it's not possible to catch the infection from someone else who has it. Symptoms of schistosomiasis Many people with schistosomiasis don't have any symptoms, or don't experience any for several months or even years. You probably won't notice that you've been infected, although occasionally people get small, itchy red bumps on their skin for a few days where the worms burrowed in. After a few weeks, some people develop: a high temperature (fever) an itchy, red, blotchy and raised rash a cough diarrhoea muscle and joint pain tummy pain a general sense of feeling unwell These symptoms, known as acute schistosomiasis, often get better by themselves within a few weeks. But it's still important to get treated because the parasite can remain in your body and lead to long-term problems. Long-term problems caused by schistosomiasis Some people with schistosomiasis, regardless of whether they had any initial symptoms or not, eventually develop more serious problems in parts of the body the eggs have travelled to. This is known as chronic schistosomiasis. Chronic schistosomiasis can include a range of symptoms and problems, depending on the exact area that's infected. For example, an infection in the: digestive system can cause anaemia , tummy pain and swelling, diarrhoea and blood in your poo urinary system can cause irritation of the bladder ( cystitis ), pain when peeing, a frequent need to pee, and blood in your pee heart and lungs can cause a persistent cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing up blood nervous system or brain can cause seizures (fits), headaches , weakness and numbness in your legs, and dizziness Without treatment, affected organs can become permanently damaged. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP if you develop the symptoms above and you've travelled in parts of the world where schistosomiasis is found, or if you're concerned that you may have been exposed to the parasites while travelling. Tell your GP about your travel history and whether you think you may have been exposed to potentially contaminated water. If your GP suspects schistosomiasis, they may refer you to an expert in tropical diseases. The diagnosis is usually made by finding eggs in a sample of your pee or poo. You may also be diagnosed by a blood test. Treatments for schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis can usually be treated successfully with a short course of a medication called praziquantel, which kills the worms. Praziquantel is most effective once the worms have grown a bit, so treatment may need to be repeated a few weeks after your first dose. Steroid medication can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of acute schistosomiasis, or symptoms caused by damage to the brain or nervous system. Preventing schistosomiasis There's no vaccine for schistosomiasis, so it's important to be aware of the risks and take precautions to avoid exposure to contaminated water. You can check whether the area you're visiting is known to have a problem with schistosomiasis using Travel Health Pro's country information section . If you're visiting one of these areas: avoid paddling, swimming and washing in fresh water – only swim in the sea or chlorinated swimming pools boil or filter water before drinking – as the parasites could burrow into your lips or mouth if you drink contaminated water avoid medicines sold locally that are advertised to treat or prevent schistosomiasis – these are often either fake, sub-standard, ineffective or not given at the correct dosage don't rely on assurances from hotels, tourist boards or similar that a particular stretch of water is safe – try to find out from an official or reliable source Quickly drying yourself with a towel after getting out of the water is not a reliable way of preventing infection, although it's a good idea to dry yourself as soon as possible if you're accidentally exposed to potentially contaminated water.

    "text": "Sciatica Sciatica happens when the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back to your feet, is irritated or compressed. It usually gets better in a few weeks to a few months but can last longer. If you get sciatica, there's a chance that it could happen again at some point. Symptoms of sciatica The symptoms of sciatica usually affect your bottom and the back of one leg, often including your foot and toes. You may feel: a sharp, burning pain down the back of the leg tingling – like pins and needles numbness weakness Your symptoms may come on suddenly but they can also start slowly. The pain may be worse when moving, sneezing or coughing. You may also have back pain, but it's not usually as bad as the pain in your leg. Information: You probably do not have sciatica if you only have back pain . How you can ease sciatica pain yourself Sciatica usually gets better in a few weeks to a few months, but it can sometimes last longer. It can also return if you've had it before. To help relieve your pain and speed up recovery: Do carry on with your normal activities as much as possible try regular exercises for sciatica start gentle exercise as soon as you can – anything that gets you moving can help hold heat packs to the painful areas – you can buy these from pharmacies ask a pharmacist about painkillers (paracetamol is unlikely to help and it's not clear how much NSAIDs , such as ibuprofen, help with sciatica) Don’t do not sit or lie down for long periods – even if moving hurts, it's not harmful and can help you get better faster Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have sciatica and the pain: has not improved after trying home treatments for a few weeks is getting worse is stopping you doing your normal activities Immediate action required: Go to A&E or call 999 if you: have sciatica on both sides have weakness or numbness in both legs that's severe or getting worse have numbness around or under your genitals, or around your bottom (anus) find it hard to start peeing, cannot pee or cannot control when you pee – and this is not normal for you do not notice when you need to poo or cannot control when you poo – and this is not normal for you These could be symptoms of a serious back problem that needs to be treated in hospital as soon as possible. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for sciatica Treatments from a GP If you have sciatica, a GP may: suggest exercises and stretches prescribe painkillers They might also refer you for: physiotherapy – including exercise advice and techniques like massage (manual therapy) psychological support – to help you cope with the pain Physiotherapy is free of charge on the NHS throughout the UK, but waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately. Other treatments for sciatica If your pain is severe and treatments from a GP have not helped, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for: a procedure to seal off some of the nerves in your back so they stop sending pain signals (radiofrequency denervation) a painkilling injection such as an epidural to stop you feeling pain surgery – an operation called decompression surgery can sometimes help relieve sciatica Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have sciatica, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your local integrated care board (ICB) search online for NHS treatment for sciatica near you How to reduce sciatica pain If you have sciatica, or have had it in the past, there's a chance that you could get it again. But there are some things you can do to help the pain: Do stay active – take regular exercise use a safe technique when lifting heavy objects make sure you have a good posture when sitting and standing sit correctly when using a computer lose weight if you're overweight Don’t do not smoke – smoking can increase your risk of getting sciatica Causes of sciatica Sciatica happens when something presses or rubs on the sciatic nerve. Causes include: a slipped disc , when a soft cushion of tissue between the bones in your spine pushes out – this is the most common cause of sciatica and is more likely to happen as you get older spinal stenosis – narrowing of the part of your spine where nerves pass through spondylolisthesis – when one of the bones in your spine slips out of position a back injury Video: What is sciatica?

    "text": "Scleroderma Scleroderma is the name for a range of conditions that affect your immune system (autoimmune conditions) and can cause hard, thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with muscles, bones, internal organs and blood vessels. The two main types of scleroderma are: localised scleroderma (morphoea) – this mostly affects the skin but some types can also affect tissues under the skin, such as muscle and bone systemic sclerosis  – this may affect blood circulation and internal organs as well as the skin There are also different types of localised scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. Some types may eventually improve on their own, while others can lead to severe and life-threatening problems. Although there's no cure for scleroderma, symptoms can usually be managed by a range of different treatments. Localised scleroderma Localised scleroderma (morphoea) can affect both children and adults. It mostly affects the skin, causing 1 or more hard patches to develop. But it can also affect tissues such as muscle and bone under the skin. Exactly how the skin is affected depends on the type of localised scleroderma. There are 2 main types, called plaque and linear morphoea. Plaque morphoea: is most common in adults causes 1 or more discoloured oval patches on the skin, which may be hairless and shiny can appear anywhere on the body may improve after a few years and treatment may not be needed Linear morphoea: causes thickened skin in lines – mostly along the arms and legs of children, but also on the forehead and scalp can affect underlying bone and muscle may improve after a few years, although it can cause permanent problems, such as shortened limbs or vision problems Systemic sclerosis In systemic sclerosis, internal organs can be affected as well as the skin. This type mostly affects women and usually develops between 30 and 50 years of age. Children are rarely affected. There are 2 types of systemic sclerosis: limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis diffuse systemic sclerosis Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis: usually only affects skin on the hands, lower arms, feet, lower legs and face, although it can eventually affect the lungs and digestive system too often starts as Raynaud's (a circulation problem where fingers and toes turn white in the cold) can have other typical symptoms that include thickening of the skin over the hands, feet and face, red spots on the skin, hard lumps under the skin, heartburn and problems swallowing ( dysphagia ) tends to get gradually worse over time, although it's generally less severe than diffuse systemic sclerosis and can often be controlled with treatment Diffuse systemic sclerosis: causes skin changes that can affect the whole body is more likely to affect internal organs has other symptoms that can include weight loss, fatigue, and joint pain and stiffness In some cases of systemic sclerosis, organs such as the heart, lungs or kidneys are affected. This can cause a range of potentially serious problems, such as shortness of breath , high blood pressure and pulmonary hypertension . Causes of scleroderma Normally, the body's immune system fights off any germs that infect the body. It responds like this to anything in the body it doesn't recognise, and settles down when the infection has been cleared. It's thought scleroderma occurs because part of the immune system has become overactive and out of control. This leads to cells in the connective tissue producing too much collagen, causing scarring and thickening (fibrosis) of the tissue. It's not clear why this happens. Certain genes are thought to be involved, and having a close family member with the condition may increase your risk. How scleroderma is treated The aim of treatment is to relieve symptoms, prevent the condition getting worse, detect and treat any complications (such as pulmonary hypertension ) and help you maintain the use of affected parts of the body. Common treatments include: medication to improve circulation medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system and slow the progression of the condition steroids to relieve joint and muscle problems moisturising affected areas of skin to help keep it supple and relieve itchiness various medicines to control other symptoms (such as pain, heartburn and high blood pressure) You will also need regular blood pressure checks and other tests to check for any problems with your organs. If your symptoms are severe, surgery may be needed. For example, hard lumps under the skin may need to be removed, and tightened muscles may need to be loosened. Newer treatments such as laser therapy and photodynamic therapy may also be available. Living with scleroderma There are many therapies and lifestyle changes that can help reduce the impact of scleroderma on your life. Regular physiotherapy and stretching exercises may help keep your muscles supple and loosen tight skin. An occupational therapist can help you adapt to any movement difficulties by suggesting changes to your home and advising you on equipment to make daily life easier. If you're affected by Raynaud's, you'll need to keep your hands and feet warm in the cold by wearing thick gloves and socks. Read more about treating Raynaud's . It's important to eat healthily, exercise regularly and stop smoking (if you smoke) to keep blood pressure under control and improve your circulation. Read more about controlling high blood pressure . Many people find it helps to read up on the condition and talk to other people who are affected. Scleroderma & Raynaud's UK (SRUK) work to improve the lives of people affected by scleroderma and Raynaud's. Systemic sclerosis and pregnancy Women with systemic sclerosis may find it harder to get pregnant and could have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage and giving birth prematurely. However, if the pregnancy is planned in consultation with a doctor during a period when the condition is stable, there's no reason why a woman with systemic sclerosis cannot have a successful pregnancy. Scleroderma and Raynaud's UK has more information about systemic sclerosis and pregnancy . Page last reviewed: 24 March 2023 Next review due: 24 March 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Scoliosis Contents Overview Treatment in children Treatment in adults Scoliosis is where the spine twists and curves to the side. It can affect people of any age, from babies to adults, but most often starts in children aged 10 to 15. Scoliosis can improve with treatment, but it is not usually a sign of anything serious and treatment is not always needed if it's mild. Symptoms of scoliosis Credit: MID ESSEX HOSPITAL SERVICES NHS TRUST/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/676525/view, https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/676524/view Signs of scoliosis include: a visibly curved spine leaning to 1 side uneven shoulders 1 shoulder or hip sticking out the ribs sticking out on 1 side clothes not fitting well Some people with scoliosis may also have back pain . This is usually more common in adults with the condition. When to see a GP See a GP if you think you or your child has scoliosis. It's unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong, but it's best to get it checked out. If the GP suspects scoliosis they should refer you to a specialist. If you're diagnosed with scoliosis, they will discuss treatment options with you. An X-ray of your back will be carried out to check how big the curve is. You can find a specialist scoliosis centre by contacting Scoliosis Support & Research: Scoliosis Support & Research: Support Treatments for scoliosis Treatment for scoliosis depends on your age, how severe the curve is, and whether it's likely to get worse with time. Many people will not need any treatment and only a small number will need to have surgery on their spine. Babies and toddlers may not need treatment as the curve might improve over time. A plaster cast or plastic brace may be fitted to their back to stop the curve getting worse as they grow. Older children may wear a back brace to stop the curve getting worse until they stop growing. Sometimes surgery may be needed to control the growth of the spine until an operation to straighten it can be done when they stop growing. Adults may need treatment to relieve pain, such as painkillers, spinal injections and, very occasionally, surgery. It's not clear whether back exercises help improve scoliosis, but general exercise is good for overall health and should not be avoided unless advised by your doctor. Read more about treatments for scoliosis in children and treatments for scoliosis in adults . Living with scoliosis Most people with scoliosis are able to live normal lives and can do most activities, including exercise and sports. The condition does not usually cause significant pain or any other health problems, and tends to stay the same after you stop growing – see a GP if it gets any worse. Having scoliosis or wearing a back brace can be tough and may cause problems with body image and self-esteem, particularly for children and teenagers. You may find it useful to contact a support group, such as Scoliosis Support & Research . These groups are a good source of information and support, and they may be able to put you in touch with people in a similar situation to you. Causes of scoliosis In around 8 in every 10 cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis cannot be prevented and is not thought to be linked to things such as bad posture, exercise or diet. Your genes may make you more likely to get it though, as it sometimes runs in families. Less commonly, scoliosis may be caused by: the bones in the spine not forming properly in the womb – this is called congenital scoliosis and is present from birth an underlying nerve or muscle condition, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy – this is called neuromuscular scoliosis wear and tear of the spine with age – this is called degenerative scoliosis, which affects older adults Scoliosis Support & Research has more information about the different types of scoliosis.

    "text": "Scurvy Scurvy (severe vitamin C deficiency) is rare as most people get enough vitamin C in their diet. It's usually easy to treat. Causes of scurvy Scurvy is caused by not having enough vitamin C in your diet over a long period of time. Vitamin C is mainly found in fruit and vegetables. However, even people who do not eat very healthily all the time are not usually considered at risk of scurvy. Things that increase your risk of scurvy Although scurvy is rare, you may be more at risk if you: have no fresh fruits or vegetables in your diet for a while eat very little food at all – possible reasons include treatments that make you feel very sick all the time (such as chemotherapy) or an eating disorder such as anorexia smoke, as smoking reduces how much vitamin C your body gets from food have a long-term dependency on drugs or alcohol that affects your diet have a poor diet while pregnant or breastfeeding, because the body needs more vitamin C at these times Babies, children and older people who find it hard to have a healthy diet may also be more at risk of scurvy. Symptoms of scurvy Symptoms of scurvy may include: feeling very tired and weak all the time feeling irritable and sad all the time joint, muscle or leg pain swollen, bleeding gums (sometimes teeth can fall out) developing red or blue spots on the skin, usually on the legs and feet, although this may be less noticeable on brown or black skin skin that bruises easily Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You or your child are at risk of scurvy and: feel very tired and weak all the time feel irritable and sad all the time have joint, muscle or leg pain have wounds that reopen or are not healing well Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 now if: You or your child are at risk of scurvy and have: skin that bruises easily swollen, bleeding gums (sometimes teeth can fall out) joint or leg swelling a high temperature (fever) or feel hot or shivery yellow whites of the eyes, or yellow skin although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin – this can be a sign of jaundice You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You or your child have: a rash that does not fade when you press a glass against it – in scurvy, this may look like red or blue spots a sudden, severe headache unlike anything you've experienced before, even if it's got a bit better now – it may have felt like you had been hit with something hard a stiff neck sensitivity to light blurred or double vision stroke-like symptoms – such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or uncontrollable shaking (convulsions) severe chest pain or difficulty breathing confusion or drowsiness Your child may appear limp, floppy or not respond like they normally do. Their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treating scurvy It's important that scurvy is treated quickly. Without treatment, scurvy can cause serious problems and may even be life-threatening. Mild cases of scurvy are often easily treated by adding some vitamin C to your diet, such as from fresh fruit and vegetables. A GP may also recommend taking vitamin C supplements (also called ascorbic acid) until you feel better. Most people treated for scurvy feel better within days and go on to make a full recovery. The GP may refer you to a specialist for treatment, support or advice. This depends on what's causing your scurvy. How to prevent a vitamin C deficiency The best sources of vitamin C are fruit and vegetables. The best way to prevent a vitamin C deficiency and get enough vitamins and minerals is to eat a healthy, balanced diet . It's important to speak to a GP or midwife before taking any supplements or making changes to your diet during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.

    "text": "Shingles Shingles is an infection that causes a painful rash. Get advice from a pharmacist or NHS 111 as soon as possible if you think you have it. Symptoms of shingles The first signs of shingles can be: a tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin a headache or feeling generally unwell A rash will usually appear a few days later. In rare cases shingles can cause pain without a rash. Usually you get the shingles rash on your chest and tummy, but it can appear anywhere on your body including on your face, eyes and genitals. The rash appears as blotches on your skin, on 1 side of your body only. A rash on both the left and right of your body is unlikely to be shingles. The blotches become itchy blisters that ooze fluid. A few days later, the blisters dry out and scab.

MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/262644/view Non-urgent advice: See a pharmacist if: you have symptoms of shingles and you're 18 years old or older Try to see a pharmacist within 3 days of the rash appearing. If you need medicine, it can help to speed up your recovery and avoid longer-lasting problems. A pharmacist can give the same antiviral medicines as a GP. They can also give advice or direct you to other medical help, if needed. Find a pharmacy Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You have symptoms of shingles and: you're pregnant you're breastfeeding and the shingles rash is on your breasts the rash is on your eye or nose you have changes to your vision you have a severely weakened immune system, for example, from chemotherapy you're 17 years old or younger You might need medicine to help speed up your recovery and avoid longer-lasting problems. This works best if you start taking it within 3 days of the shingles rash appearing. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment for shingles Treatment for shingles depends on how severe your symptoms are and whether you're at risk of complications. If you have a mild rash you may not need any treatment. You may be offered medicine (antiviral tablets) to help speed up your recovery from shingles if: you have a weakened immune system your pain or your rash is moderate or severe the rash is affecting other areas of your body apart from your chest, tummy and back You usually need to start taking the medicine within 3 days of your rash first appearing. Treatment for shingles can also include medicines to help relieve pain, such as painkillers, steroid tablets or medicines that help with nerve pain. How to treat shingles symptoms yourself If you have shingles there are things you can do to help with the symptoms. Do take paracetamol to ease pain keep the rash clean and dry to reduce the risk of infection wear loose-fitting clothing use a cool compress (a bag of ice cubes or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel, or a wet cloth) a few times a day Don’t do not let dressings or plasters stick to the rash do not wear clothes with rough fibres that can irritate your skin How long shingles lasts It can take up to 4 weeks for the shingles rash to heal. Your skin can be painful for weeks after the rash has gone, but it usually gets better over time. Stay away from certain groups of people if you have shingles You cannot spread shingles to others. But people could catch chickenpox from you if they have not had chickenpox before or have not had the chickenpox vaccine. This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus. Try to avoid: anyone who is pregnant and has not had chickenpox before people with a weakened immune system – like someone having chemotherapy babies less than 1 month old Important: Work and school Stay off work or school if the rash is still oozing fluid (weeping) and cannot be covered, or until the rash has dried out. You can only spread the infection to other people while the rash oozes fluid. You can cover the rash with loose clothing or a non-sticky dressing. Complications of shingles Most people recover from shingles without any problems. But it can sometimes cause complications, such as: post-herpetic neuralgia , where pain lasts for several months after the shingles rash has gone the rash becoming infected, which may need to be treated with antibiotics scarring or changes in skin colour after the rash has healed muscle weakness eye problems, which can lead to sight loss Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare condition where shingles affects your facial nerve, causing weakness on one side of your face and sometimes hearing problems You can reduce the risk of complications by getting treatment as soon as possible after your symptoms start. Shingles and pregnancy If you're pregnant and get shingles, it's mostly mild and there's usually no risk to you or your baby. But a GP should arrange for a specialist to advise on whether you need treatment. Causes of shingles You cannot get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox. But you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have not had chickenpox before. When people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body. It can be reactivated later and cause shingles if someone's immune system is weakened. This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy. Shingles vaccine A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for: people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023 people aged 70 to 79 who have not yet been vaccinated people aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system The vaccine helps reduce your risk of getting shingles. If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder. You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before. Ask your GP surgery if you can get the vaccine on the NHS. Page last reviewed: 23 November 2023 Next review due: 23 November 2026"

    "text": "Short-sightedness (myopia) Short-sightedness (myopia) is a very common eye condition where you cannot see objects far away clearly. It's usually corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Symptoms of short-sightedness Short-sightedness usually starts in children from age 6 to 13. It can also happen in adults. Signs you or your child may be short-sighted include: difficulty reading words from a distance, such as reading the whiteboard at school sitting close to the TV or computer, or holding a mobile phone or tablet close to the face getting headaches rubbing the eyes a lot Short-sightedness often runs in families, so you may have relatives who are also short-sighted. It can get worse until the eye has stopped growing, at around 20 years of age. Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you or your child has signs of short-sightedness you or your child has not had an eye test for 2 years What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child is short-sighted, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You'll be asked to look at a light or read letters on a chart while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given special eyedrops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly. If you or your child needs glasses, you'll be given a prescription. You can take this to any optician. Find out more about eye tests for children Information: NHS eye tests NHS eye tests are free for some people, including: children aged under 18, or under 19 and in full-time education if you've been diagnosed with diabetes or glaucoma if you're on some benefits, including Income Support and Universal Credit Find out more about free NHS eye tests Treatments for short-sightedness Short-sightedness can usually be treated with glasses or contact lenses. These help your eyes focus correctly, so you can see distant objects more clearly. Glasses are suitable for children and adults. Contact lenses are only suitable for adults and some children An optician will advise you about the best option for your short-sightedness. Help with costs of glasses and contact lenses Some people are entitled to a voucher to help towards the cost of glasses or contact lenses (NHS optical voucher), including: children aged under 18, or under 19 and in full-time education if you're on some benefits, including Income Support and Universal Credit If you do not have a voucher, you'll have to pay for glasses or contact lenses. Find out more about NHS optical vouchers Laser eye surgery and lens surgery Surgery can be used to improve sight in some adults. There are 2 different types of surgery: laser surgery to reshape the front of the eye lens surgery to replace the lenses in your eyes with artificial lenses This type of surgery is not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Find out more about laser eye surgery and lens surgery How to stop short-sightedness getting worse It's not clear why short-sightedness happens and it's hard to prevent it. But there are some things that can help stop it getting worse. These include: spending more time outdoors (especially children) wearing bi-focal or multi-focal contact lenses An optometrist may talk to you about specially designed glasses or contact lenses for your child, which may help slow down the development of myopia. This is called myopia management or myopia control. But it's not available on the NHS as more research is needed. Find out more about myopia in children on The College of Optometrists website . Some opticians may advise wearing a special lens overnight (orthokeratology). This can help you see better without glasses or contact lenses. If you're worried about your or your child's eyesight getting worse, talk to an optician. Complications of short-sightedness Young children with untreated short-sightedness are more likely to get other conditions, such as: a squint – where the eyes point in different directions a lazy eye – where sight in 1 eye does not develop properly Some adults with severe short sight-sightedness are more likely to develop: glaucoma – increased pressure inside the eyes detached retina – where the thin layer at the back of your eye (retina) becomes loose; this needs urgent treatment to prevent losing your sight cataracts – cloudy patches inside the lens of the eye Page last reviewed: 10 May 2022 Next review due: 10 May 2025"

    "text": "Overview - Sickle cell disease Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Carriers Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of inherited health conditions that affect the red blood cells. The most serious type is called sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell disease is particularly common in people with an African or Caribbean family background. People with sickle cell disease produce unusually shaped red blood cells that can cause problems because they do not live as long as healthy blood cells and can block blood vessels. Sickle cell disease is a serious and lifelong health condition, although treatment can help manage many of the symptoms. Symptoms of sickle cell disease People born with sickle cell disease tend to have problems from early childhood, although some children have few symptoms and lead normal lives most of the time. The main symptoms of sickle cell disease are: painful episodes called sickle cell crises, which can be very severe and last for days or weeks an increased risk of serious infections anaemia (where red blood cells cannot carry enough oxygen around the body), which can cause tiredness and shortness of breath Some people also experience other problems, such as delayed growth, strokes and lung problems. Find out more about the symptoms of sickle cell disease Causes of sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease is caused by a gene that affects how red blood cells develop. If both parents have the gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have being born with sickle cell disease. The child's parents often will not have sickle cell disease themselves and they're only carriers of the sickle cell trait. Find out more about the causes of sickle cell disease Screening and testing for sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease is often detected during pregnancy or soon after birth. Screening for sickle cell disease in pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women in England to check if there's a risk of a child being born with the condition, and all babies are offered screening as part of the newborn blood spot test (heel prick test). Blood tests can also be carried out at any age to check for sickle cell disease or see if you're a carrier of the gene that causes it. Find out more about screening and testing for sickle cell disease Treatments for sickle cell disease People with sickle cell disease need treatment throughout their lives. This is usually delivered by different health professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre. It's also important for people with sickle cell disease to look after their own health using self care measures, such as by avoiding triggers and managing pain. A number of treatments for sickle cell disease are available. For example: drinking plenty of fluids and staying warm to prevent painful episodes painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (sometimes treatment with stronger painkillers in hospital may be necessary) daily antibiotics and having regular vaccinations to reduce your chances of getting an infection a medicine called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) to reduce symptoms regular blood transfusions if symptoms continue or get worse, or there are signs of damage caused by sickle cell disease an emergency blood transfusion if severe anaemia develops The only cure for sickle cell disease is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant , but they're not done very often because of the risks involved. Read more about how sickle cell disease is treated and living with sickle cell disease . Outlook for sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease varies between individuals from mild to serious, but most people with it lead happy and normal lives. Mild sickle cell disease may have no impact on a person's day-to-day life. But the illness can be serious enough to have a significant effect on a person's life. It can lead to health problems like strokes, serious infections and lung problems, which can occasionally be fatal. Overall, the life expectancy for someone with sickle cell disease tends to be shorter than normal, but this can vary depending on the exact type of sickle cell disease they have, how it's treated and what problems they experience. Video: sickle cell anaemia This video explains what sickle cell anaemia is and Junior describes living with the condition. Media last reviewed: 3 August 2024 Media review due: 3 August 2027 Carriers of sickle cell (sickle cell trait) A carrier of sickle cell is someone who carries the gene that causes sickle cell disease but does not have sickle cell disease themselves. It's also known as having the sickle cell trait. People with the sickle cell trait will not develop sickle cell disease, but are at risk of having a child with it if their partner is also a carrier. You can request a blood test to check if you carry the sickle cell trait from your GP surgery or the nearest sickle cell and thalassaemia centre. Find out more about being a sickle cell carrier More information and support Finding out as much as possible about sickle cell disease may help you feel more in control of your illness.

    "title": "Silicosis",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/silicosis/",
    "text": "Silicosis Silicosis is a long-term lung disease caused by inhaling large amounts of crystalline silica dust, usually over many years. Silica is a substance naturally found in certain types of stone, rock, sand and clay. Working with these materials can create a very fine dust that can be easily inhaled. Once inside the lungs, it causes swelling (inflammation) and gradually leads to areas of hardened and scarred lung tissue (fibrosis). Lung tissue that's scarred in this way doesn't function properly. People who work in the following industries are particularly at risk: stone masonry and stone cutting – especially with sandstone construction and demolition – as a result of exposure to concrete and paving materials worktop manufacturing and fitting pottery, ceramics and glass manufacturing mining and quarrying sand blasting Signs and symptoms The symptoms of silicosis usually take many years to develop, and you may not notice any problems until after you've stopped working with silica dust. The symptoms can also continue to get worse, even if you're no longer exposed. Silicosis usually develops after being exposed to silica for 10-20 years, although it can sometimes develop after 5-10 years of exposure. Occasionally, it can occur after only a few months of very heavy exposure. Main symptoms The main symptoms of silicosis are: a persistent cough persistent shortness of breath weakness and tiredness If the condition continues to get worse, these symptoms may become more severe. Some people may eventually find simple activities such as walking or climbing stairs very difficult and may be largely confined to their house or bed. The condition can ultimately be fatal if the lungs stop working properly (respiratory failure) or serious complications develop, but this is rare in the UK. Further problems Silicosis can also increase your risk of getting other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, including: tuberculosis (TB) and other chest infections pulmonary hypertension heart failure arthritis kidney disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lung cancer When to see your GP See your GP if you think there's a possibility you could have silicosis. They'll ask you about your symptoms and work history, and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. They'll want to know about any periods when you may have been exposed to silica and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working. If silicosis is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests to confirm the diagnosis. Tests you may have include: a chest X-ray to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs a computerised tomography (CT) scan of your chest to produce more detailed images of your lungs lung function testing (spirometry), which involves breathing into a machine called a spirometer to assess how well your lungs are working A test for TB may also be recommended because you're more likely to get TB if you have silicosis. Treating silicosis There's no cure for silicosis because the lung damage can't be reversed. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. The condition may continue to get worse, leading to further lung damage and serious disability, although this may happen very slowly over many years. The risk of complications may be reduced if you: ensure you're not exposed to any more silica stop smoking (if you smoke) have regular tests to check for TB, if advised by your doctor have the annual flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine You may be offered long-term home oxygen therapy if you're having difficulty breathing and have low levels of oxygen in your blood. Bronchodilator medicines may also be prescribed to widen your airways and make breathing easier. You'll be given a course of antibiotics if you develop a bacterial chest infection. In very severe cases, a lung transplant may be an option, although there are strict health requirements to meet before this will be considered. Preventing silicosis Silicosis can be prevented by avoiding prolonged exposure to silica dust. In the UK, all workplaces must comply with The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002, which sets a workplace exposure limit for silica. Your employer should: warn you about any risks to your health make sure you're aware of the correct procedures to reduce your risk of exposure to silica dust supply you with the necessary equipment to protect you Further information: Health and Safety Executive: Control of exposure to silica dust Health and Safety Executive: The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations – Guidance Claiming compensation If you've been diagnosed with silicosis, you may be able to claim compensation in one of the following ways: industrial injuries disablement benefit – a sum of money paid weekly to people with silicosis who were exposed to silica while in employment (but not self-employment) and to people who have silicosis and lung cancer launch a civil claim for compensation through the courts (you'll need to get legal advice about how to do this) claim a lump sum in compensation under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 – if you have silicosis, or you're the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer liable has stopped trading Further information: GOV.UK - Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Page last reviewed: 23 January 2024 Next review due: 23 January 2027"

    "text": "Nasal and sinus cancer Nasal and sinus cancer is a rare cancer that affects the nasal cavity (the space behind your nose) and the sinuses (small air-filled cavities inside your nose, cheekbones and forehead). Nasal and sinus cancer is different from cancer of the area where the nose and throat connect. This is called nasopharyngeal cancer . Credit: Gwen Shockey/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/704091/view Symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer The most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are: a blocked nose that does not go away and usually only affects 1 side nosebleeds a decreased sense of smell mucus running from your nose – this can be bloody mucus draining into the back of your nose and throat These symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as a cold or sinusitis . At a later stage, symptoms can include: pain or numbness in the face, particularly in the upper cheek, that does not go away swollen glands in the neck partial loss of vision or double vision a bulging eye a watering eye that does not go away pain or pressure in 1 ear a persistent lump or growth on your face, nose or roof of your mouth When to see a GP See a GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms. It's very unlikely they'll be caused by nasal or sinus cancer, but it's worth getting them checked out. If a GP thinks you might need some tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, you'll usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant at a hospital. Diagnosing nasal and sinus cancer Tests you may have to help diagnose nasal and sinus cancer include: a nasal endoscopy (nasoendoscopy) – where a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera and light at the end is inserted into your nose to examine the area; this can be uncomfortable, so before the procedure you'll be asked whether you'd like anaesthetic sprayed on the back of your throat a biopsy – where a small sample of tissue is removed and examined; this may be done during an endoscopy a fine needle aspiration – where fluid and cells are taken from a lymph node using a needle to see if the cancer has spread If you're diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer, you may have a CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan or ultrasound scan to help stage and grade the cancer. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the stages and grades of different types of nasal and sinus cancer . Risk groups for nasal and sinus cancer Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer. These include: prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work – including wood dust, leather dust, cloth fibres, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde smoking – the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer human papillomavirus (HPV) – a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of nasal and sinus cancer . Treatments for nasal and sinus cancer The treatment recommended for you will depend on several factors, including the stage at which the cancer was diagnosed, how far it's spread, and your general level of health. Treatment may include: surgery to remove a tumour – this can be performed through open surgery or as keyhole surgery through the nose (endoscopic microsurgery) radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill the cancerous cells, shrink a tumour before surgery, or destroy small pieces of a tumour that may be left after surgery chemotherapy – where medicine is used to help shrink or slow down the growth of a tumour, or reduce the risk of the cancer returning after surgery If you smoke, it's important that you give up. Smoking increases your risk of cancer returning and may cause you to have more side effects from treatment. Your treatment will be organised by a head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), who'll discuss the treatment options with you. A combination of treatments will often be recommended. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the treatment of nasal and sinus cancer . Outlook for nasal and sinus cancer There are many different types of cancer that can affect the nasal cavity and sinuses. The outlook varies, depending on the specific type of nasal and sinus cancer you have, its exact location, how far it's spread before being diagnosed and treated, and your overall level of health and fitness. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the outlook for nasal and sinus cancer . Help and support Being diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer can be a shock and may be difficult to come to terms with. Everyone reacts differently. Talking about how you feel with your family and friends can be a big help. But if you're unable to talk with family or friends, other sources of help and support are available. For example, Cancer Research UK has nurses you can speak to by calling 0808 800 4040 (freephone), 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.

But medicines can help if it's taking a long time to go away. Symptoms of sinusitis Sinusitis is common after a cold or flu . The main symptoms of sinusitis include: pain, swelling and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead a blocked or runny nose a reduced sense of smell green or yellow mucus from your nose a high temperature Other symptoms include: a headache toothache bad breath a cough a feeling of pressure in the ears You may also snore at night and sound nasal when you speak. Young children may also be irritable, have difficulty feeding and breathe through their mouth. What are the sinuses? The sinuses are small, empty spaces behind your cheekbones and forehead that connect to the inside of the nose. Sinusitis causes the lining of the sinuses to swell up. This stops mucus draining into your nose and throat properly, making you feel blocked up. How you can treat sinusitis yourself You can usually treat mild sinusitis yourself by: getting plenty of rest drinking plenty of fluids taking painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (do not give aspirin to children under 16) avoiding things that trigger your allergies not smoking cleaning your nose with a salt water solution How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution Boil around 470ml (1 pint) of water, then leave it to cool. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water. Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it. Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat. Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day (making a new solution each time) until your nose feels more comfortable. If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.

It may help to ask someone to stay with you while you sleep so they can check for the symptoms. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have any of the main symptoms of sleep apnoea, such as: your breathing stops and starts while you sleep you make gasping, snorting or choking noises while you sleep you always feel very tired during the day If someone else has seen you have the symptoms, it can help to bring them with you to the GP. Sleep apnoea can be serious if it's not diagnosed and treated. Getting tested for sleep apnoea If a GP thinks you might have sleep apnoea, they may refer you to a specialist sleep clinic for tests. At the clinic, you may be given devices that check things like your breathing and heartbeat while you sleep. You'll be asked to wear these overnight so doctors can check for signs of sleep apnoea. You can usually do this at home, but sometimes you may need to stay in the clinic overnight. The test can show if you have sleep apnoea and how severe it is. This is based on how often your breathing stops while you sleep (AHI score). Understanding your AHI score Your AHI score shows how severe your sleep apnoea is: AHI of 5 to 14 = mild AHI of 15 to 30 = moderate AHI over 30 = severe Treatments for sleep apnoea Sleep apnoea can sometimes be treated by making lifestyle changes like losing weight, giving up smoking and reducing how much alcohol you drink. But many people need to use a device called a CPAP machine. You'll be given this for free on the NHS if you need it.

You may go back to bed on your own, or wake up feeling confused. You will not remember sleepwalking when you wake up. Causes of sleepwalking Sleepwalking happens when you partly wake from deep sleep in a way that means you can move but your brain is not fully awake. It's not known exactly why this happens, but it can be linked to things such as: not getting enough sleep other conditions that affect your sleep, such as sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome being unwell with a high temperature taking certain medicines, such as sleeping pills stress drinking alcohol Sleepwalking is more common in children, and if you have other family members who also sleepwalk. Things you can do to help with sleepwalking There are things you can do to help prevent sleepwalking and reduce the risk of accidents. Do keep doors and windows closed, and use stair gates to keep children safe keep floors clear and remove anything that someone could trip on lock away sharp objects like knives and tools fit door alarms if there's a risk of leaving the house try to get enough sleep – relax before bed, avoid naps during the day, and go to bed and get up at the same times each day try to manage stress try keeping a sleep diary, recording whether you sleepwalked and things like what time you went to bed, how well you slept, whether you had caffeine or alcohol and whether you were feeling tired or stressed – this can help you identify anything that might make you more likely to sleepwalk Don’t do not drink caffeine or alcohol in the evening do not let your child sleep in the top of a bunk bed if they sleepwalk What to do when someone's sleepwalking If someone's sleepwalking, try to gently guide them back to bed.

    "text": "Slipped disc A slipped disc, also called a prolapsed or herniated disc, is when a soft cushion of tissue between the bones in your spine bulges outwards. It's painful if it presses on nerves. It usually gets better slowly with rest, gentle exercise and painkillers. Symptoms of a slipped disc A slipped disc can cause: lower back pain numbness or tingling in your shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs or feet neck pain problems bending or straightening your back muscle weakness pain in the buttocks, hips or legs if the disc is pressing on the sciatic nerve ( sciatica ) Not all slipped discs cause symptoms. Many people will never know they have slipped a disc. Other causes of back pain Sometimes back pain may be a result of an injury such as a sprain or strain , but often there's no obvious reason. Back pain is rarely caused by anything serious. How you can ease the pain from a slipped disc yourself Keeping active and taking painkillers can help ease the pain from a slipped disc. Keep active If the pain is very bad, you may need to rest at first. But start gentle exercise as soon as you can – it'll help you get better faster. The type of exercise is not important, just gradually increase your activity level. Take painkillers Try anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen to help ease the pain. Take them regularly (up to the recommended daily amount) rather than just when the pain is particularly bad. This will help you to keep moving. A pharmacist can help with a slipped disc Anti-inflammatory painkillers are not suitable for everyone. Speak to a pharmacist if you're not sure if you can take them. You can also get advice from a pharmacist about stronger painkillers containing codeine.

    "text": "Low sperm count Low sperm count is when there's a low amount of sperm in your semen. It can make it harder for you and your partner to get pregnant (conceive), but it may still be possible to conceive naturally and there are fertility treatments that can help. Low sperm count can happen in men of any age. It can affect anyone who has testicles and produces sperm. Signs of low sperm count You could have a low sperm count if you and your partner are having difficulty getting pregnant (conceiving). You usually find out you have a low sperm count after having tests to check your fertility. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you and your partner have been having regular sex without using contraception for over 1 year (or 6 months if your partner is 36 or over) and have not been able to get pregnant Your GP can arrange some tests to check both of your fertility, including tests for low sperm count. Tests for low sperm count The main test to check for low sperm count is a semen analysis test. This involves a sample of your semen being tested to check the amount of sperm in it. The test also checks how fast the sperm move and the shape of your sperm. If your semen analysis test results find a possible problem, you'll have another semen analysis test usually around 3 months after the first test. If the 2nd test also finds a problem with your sperm, you will be referred to a specialist for more tests. This may include blood tests, an ultrasound scan of your testicles or a urine test.

    "title": "Overview-Spina bifida",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spina-bifida/",
    "text": "Overview - Spina bifida Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Treatment Spina bifida is when a baby's spine and spinal cord does not develop properly in the womb, causing a gap in the spine. Spina bifida is a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure that eventually develops into the baby's brain and spinal cord. The neural tube starts to form in early pregnancy and closes about 4 weeks after conception. In spina bifida, part of the neural tube does not develop or close properly, leading to defects in the spinal cord and bones of the spine (vertebrae). It's not known what causes spina bifida, but a lack of folic acid before and in the early stages of pregnancy is a significant risk factor. Types of spina bifida There are several different types of spina bifida, including: myelomeningocele – the most severe type of spina bifida; the baby's spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the back, allowing the spinal cord and protective membranes around it to push out and form a sac in the baby's back meningocele – another serious type of spina bifida where the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the spine; the spinal cord usually develops normally so surgery can often be used to remove the membranes without damaging the nerves spina bifida occulta – the most common and mildest type of spina bifida; 1 or more vertebrae does not form properly, but the gap in the spine is very small; spina bifida occulta does not usually cause any problems and most people are unaware they have it These pages focus on myelomeningocele, the most severe type of spina bifida. Shine is a charity that provides help and support for people affected by spina bifida. Their website has more information about the other types of spina bifida . Symptoms of spina bifida Most people with spina bifida are able to have surgery to close the opening in the spine. But the nervous system will usually already have been damaged, which can lead to problems such as: weakness or total paralysis of the legs bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence loss of skin sensation in the legs and around the bottom – the child is unable to feel hot or cold, which can lead to accidental injury Many babies will have or develop hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain), which can further damage the brain. Most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence, but some have learning difficulties. Read more about the symptoms of spina bifida . Causes of spina bifida The cause of spina bifida is unknown, but a number of factors can increase the risk of a baby developing the condition. These include: low folic acid intake during pregnancy having a family history of spina bifida medicines – taking certain medicines such as valproic acid (used to prevent seizures) during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida Read more about the causes of spina bifida . Diagnosing spina bifida Spina bifida is often detected during the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan , which is offered to all pregnant women between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy. If tests confirm that your baby has spina bifida, the implications will be discussed with you. This will include a discussion about the possible problems associated with the condition, the treatment and support your child may need if you decide to continue with the pregnancy, and what your options are regarding ending the pregnancy, if that's your choice. Tests after birth Once the baby is born, a number of tests may be carried out to find out how bad the condition is and help decide which treatments are likely to be the best option. Tests may include: monitoring your child's head growth and carrying out a brain scan, using an ultrasound scan , CT scan or MRI scan , to check for hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain) ultrasound scans of the bladder and kidneys to check whether your baby stores their pee normally an assessment of your baby's movements to check for paralysis Surgery to repair the spine will usually be recommended soon after your baby is born. Treating spina bifida Treatments for the symptoms or conditions associated with spina bifida include: surgery soon after birth to close the opening in the spine and treat hydrocephalus therapies to help make day-to-day life easier and improve independence, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy assistive devices and mobility equipment , such as a wheelchair, or walking aids treatments for bowel and urinary problems With the right treatment and support, many children with spina bifida survive well into adulthood. It can be a challenging condition to live with, but many adults with spina bifida are able to lead independent and fulfilling lives. Read more about treating spina bifida . Preventing spina bifida with folic acid The best way to prevent spina bifida is to take folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy. Folic acid recommendations You should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day while you're trying to get pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant. If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant. Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you. You should also try to eat foods that contain folate (the natural form of folic acid), such as broccoli, spinach and chickpeas. Read more about folic acid , including folic acid supplements and foods containing folate. Recommendations for women at higher risk of spina bifida Women thought to be at higher risk of having a child with spina bifida need to be prescribed a higher (5 milligram) dose of folic acid by a GP. Women at higher risk include those: with a family history of neural tube defects with a partner with a family history of neural tube defects who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect with diabetes A GP can advise you further about this. If you're taking medicine to treat epilepsy , you should ask your GP for advice. You may also need to take a higher dose of folic acid. Help and support If you have a child with spina bifida or you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by it. Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with details about local support groups and organisations. You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If you or your child has spina bifida, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

It gets worse over time, but there are medicines and other treatments to help manage the symptoms. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) The symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) affect everyone differently, but can include: muscle weakness – such as floppy or weak arms and legs movement problems – such as difficulty sitting up, crawling or walking problems with breathing or swallowing twitching or shaking muscles (tremors) bone and joint problems – such as an unusually curved spine (scoliosis) These symptoms are most often noticed in babies and toddlers, but they can also start in teenagers and adults. SMA does not affect intelligence or cause learning disabilities. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you or your child have symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) you're worried about your baby or toddler's development you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy and someone in your or your partner's family has SMA Types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is often grouped into types. These are based on the age that symptoms begin and how they affect sitting, standing and walking. The 4 most common types of SMA Type When it starts Type 1 Babies less than 6 months old Type 2 Babies and toddlers aged 6 to 17 months old Type 3 Children and teenagers from 18 months to 17 years old Type 4 Adults 18 years old and over Information: Find out more SMA UK: symptoms and effects of SMA SMA UK: rarer types of SMA How spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) affects your life Although spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) affects everyone differently, some types are considered more severe and can affect how long someone lives. SMA is usually more severe the earlier symptoms begin. However, the outlook for each type depends on a person's symptoms and how well treatment works. Information: Find out more SMA UK: living with SMA Causes of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Most types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are caused by an altered gene called SMN1 being passed on to a child by their parents (inherited). The parents do not usually have SMA themselves, which is known as \"carrying\" the gene. In most cases, SMA can only be passed on if both parents carry the altered gene. If both parents carry the altered gene, there's a: 1 in 4 (25%) chance their child will have SMA 2 in 4 (50%) chance their child will carry the altered gene, but will not have SMA 1 in 4 (25%) chance their child will not carry the altered gene or have SMA The chances of a child inheriting SMA can be different for some rarer types of SMA. Some rarer types are not passed on at all. Information: Find out more SMA UK: the genetics of SMA How spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is diagnosed If a doctor thinks your child could have spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a blood test can be used to confirm the diagnosis. If you're at risk of having a child with SMA, a GP may refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss the risks and options. Tests are available before, during and after pregnancy to see if you carry the altered gene or to confirm a diagnosis. These tests may include: a genetic blood test to see if you carry the altered gene chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis tests during pregnancy to check if your baby has SMA a blood test after your baby is born Information: Find out more SMA UK: family planning for couples affected by SMA Treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) There is currently no cure for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), but there are treatments and support available to help people with SMA have the best possible quality of life. A range of health professionals may be involved in your or your child's care. They'll help to create a care plan and advise you about which treatments are suitable for your specific needs. Medicines for SMA The main treatment for SMA is medicines that target the altered genes that cause SMA, including: nusinersen (Spinraza) risdiplam (Evrysdi) onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) It's not always possible to have medicines to help treat SMA. The most suitable treatments will depend on your or your child's age and symptoms. Your care team will be able to discuss the risks and benefits of any possible treatments. Research is continuing into possible new treatments for SMA. Treatments and support for living with SMA Treatment and support is also available for the symptoms of SMA. Every person's needs will be different depending on their symptoms. Support you or your child might need may include: physiotherapy, exercises and stretches to help maintain strength and stop joints becoming stiff mobility equipment (including walking frames and wheelchairs), supports for the arms or legs (splints or braces) or shoe inserts that make walking easier (orthotics) help with breathing problems, such as breathing exercises or machines that help clear mucus from the airways or provide air through a mask help with swallowing problems, such as making diet changes or using a feeding tube that's passed down the nose or attached directly through the tummy a back brace or surgery to help with spine problems People with SMA are also usually advised to have the flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine . Help and support for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) If you or your child have spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), health professionals will be there to support you throughout your treatment. You may also find it helpful to get support from other people with SMA, or parents of children with SMA. SMA UK The charity SMA UK provides a range of support and information for people affected by SMA. SMA UK: community support team for emotional support and practical advice SMA UK: connect with the SMA community to meet others, share experiences and ask questions SMA UK: information about living with SMA Recording information about you and your condition If you or your child have spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) .

    "text": "Spondylolisthesis Spondylolisthesis is where one of the bones in your spine, called a vertebra, slips forward. It can be painful, but there are treatments that can help. It may happen anywhere along the spine, but is most common in the lower back. Symptoms of spondylolisthesis The main symptoms of spondylolisthesis include: pain in your lower back, often worse when standing or walking and relieved when sitting or bending forward pain spreading to your bottom or thighs tight hamstrings (the muscles in the back of your thighs) pain, numbness or tingling spreading from your lower back down 1 leg ( sciatica ) Spondylolisthesis does not always cause symptoms. Information: Spondylolisthesis is not the same as a slipped disc . This is when the tissue between the bones in your spine pushes out. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have lower back pain that does not go away after 3 to 4 weeks you have pain in your thighs or bottom that does not go away after 3 to 4 weeks you're finding it difficult to walk or stand up straight you're worried about the pain or you're struggling to cope you have pain, numbness and tingling down 1 leg for more than 3 or 4 weeks What happens at your GP appointment If you have symptoms of spondylolisthesis, the GP may examine your back. They may also ask you to lie down and raise 1 leg straight up in the air. This is painful if you have tight hamstrings or sciatica caused by spondylolisthesis. The GP may arrange an X-ray to see if a bone in your spine has slipped forward. You may have other scans, such as an MRI scan , if you have pain, numbness or weakness in your legs. Treatments for spondylolisthesis Treatments for spondylolisthesis depend on the symptoms you have and how severe they are. Common treatments include: avoiding activities that make symptoms worse, such as bending, lifting, athletics and gymnastics taking anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen or stronger painkillers on prescription steroid injections in your back to relieve pain, numbness and tingling in your leg physiotherapy to strengthen and stretch the muscles in your lower back, tummy and legs The GP may refer you to a physiotherapist, or you can refer yourself in some areas. Waiting times for physiotherapy on the NHS can be long. You can also get it privately. Find a physiotherapist on the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website Surgery for spondylolisthesis The GP may refer you to a specialist for back surgery if other treatments do not work. Types of surgery include: spinal fusion – the slipped bone (vertebra) is joined to the bone below with metal rods, screws and a bone graft lumbar decompression – a procedure to relieve pressure on the compressed spinal nerves The operation is done under general anaesthetic , which means you will not be awake. Recovery from surgery can take several weeks, but if often improves many of the symptoms of spondylolisthesis. Talk to your surgeon about the risks and benefits of spinal surgery. Causes of spondylolisthesis Spondylolisthesis can: happen as you get older – the bones of the spine can weaken with age run in families be caused by a tiny crack in a bone (stress fracture) – this is more common in athletes and gymnasts Page last reviewed: 01 June 2022 Next review due: 01 June 2025"

    "text": "Sprains and strains Sprains and strains are common injuries affecting the muscles and ligaments. Most can be treated at home without seeing a GP. Check if you have a sprain or strain It's likely to be a sprain or strain if: you have pain, tenderness or weakness – usually around your ankle, foot, wrist, thumb, knee, leg or back the injured area is swollen or bruised you cannot put weight on the injury or use it normally you have muscle spasms or cramping – where your muscles painfully tighten on their own Is it a sprain or a strain? Differences between sprains and strains Sprains Strains Torn or twisted ligament (tissue that connects the joints) Overstretched or torn muscle (also known as a pulled muscle) Most common in wrists, ankles, thumbs, knees Most common in feet, legs, back How to treat sprains and strains yourself For the first 2 to 3 days after a sprain or strain, follow the 5 steps known as PRICE therapy to help bring down swelling and support the injury: Protection – protect the injury, for example by using a support, or shoes that support your foot or ankle. Rest – stop any exercise or activities and try not to put any weight on the injury. Ice – apply an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a tea towel) to the injury for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours. Compression – wrap a bandage around the injury to support it during the day. Elevate – keep it raised on a pillow as much as possible. To help prevent swelling, try to avoid heat (such as hot baths and heat packs), alcohol and massages for the first couple of days. When you can move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so the joint or muscle does not become stiff. A pharmacist can help with sprains and strains Speak to a pharmacist about the best treatment for you. They might suggest tablets, or a cream or gel you rub on the skin. At first, try painkillers like paracetamol to ease the pain and ibuprofen gel, mousse or spray to bring down swelling. If needed, you can take ibuprofen tablets, capsules or syrup that you swallow. Find a pharmacy How long it takes for a sprain or strain to heal After 2 weeks, most sprains and strains will feel better. Avoid strenuous exercise such as running for up to 8 weeks, as there's a risk of further damage. Severe sprains and strains can take months to get back to normal. You cannot always prevent sprains and strains Sprains and strains happen when you overstretch or twist a muscle. Not warming up before exercising, tired muscles and playing sport are common causes. Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if: You've had an injury and: it's very painful, or the pain is getting worse there's a large amount of swelling or bruising, or the swelling or bruising is getting worse it hurts to put weight on it it feels very stiff or is difficult to move it's not feeling any better after treating it yourself you also have a very high temperature or feel hot and shivery – this could be an infection You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . You could also go to an urgent treatment centre. Treatments for sprains and strains If you need treatment for a sprain or strain you may be given self-care advice or prescribed a stronger painkiller. You may need an X-ray , which can sometimes be done at an urgent treatment centre, or you may be referred to hospital. Physiotherapy for sprains and strains If you have a sprain or strain that's taking longer than usual to get better, a GP may be able to refer you to a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy from the NHS might not be available everywhere and waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately. Find a physiotherapist Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have a sprain or strain, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the reception staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your local integrated care board (ICB) search online for NHS treatment for sprains and strains near you Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you heard a crack when you had your injury the injured body part has changed shape or is pointing at an odd angle the injured body part is numb, tingling or has pins and needles the skin around the injury has changed colour, such as looking blue or grey, or is cold to touch You may have broken a bone and will need an X-ray. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you.

    "text": "Overview - Squint Contents Overview Surgery A squint, also called strabismus, is where the eyes point in different directions. It's particularly common in young children, but can happen at any age. One of the eyes may turn in, out, up or down while the other eye looks ahead. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/256627/view This may happen all the time or it may come and go. Treatment is usually recommended to correct a squint, as it's unlikely to get better on its own and it could cause further problems if not treated early on. When to get medical advice Get advice if: your child has a squint all the time your child is older than 3 months and has a squint that comes and goes – in babies younger than this, squints that come and go are common and are not usually a cause for concern you have any concerns about your child's vision – signs of a problem can include regularly turning their head to one side or keeping one eye closed when looking at things you develop a squint or double vision later in life A GP, health visitor or local opticians service can refer you to an eye specialist for some simple tests and treatment if necessary. Treatments and surgery for a squint The main treatments for a squint are: Glasses – these can help if a squint is caused by a problem with your child's eyesight, such as long-sightedness . Eye exercises – exercises for the muscles that control eye movement may sometimes help the eyes work together better. Surgery – this involves moving the muscles that control eye movement so the eyes line up correctly. It may be recommended if glasses are not fully effective on their own. Read more about squint surgery . Injections into the eye muscles – these weaken the eye muscles, which can help the eyes line up better. But the effect usually lasts less than 3 months. If your child has a lazy eye as a result of their squint it may need to be treated first. Treatment for a lazy eye usually involves wearing a patch over the unaffected eye to help improve vision in the affected eye. Problems a child may have if a squint is not treated It's important not to ignore a squint that happens all the time or develops after 3 months of age. It could lead to further problems if left untreated, such as: persistent blurred or double vision a lazy eye – where the brain starts to ignore signals coming from the affected eye, so your child does not develop normal eyesight embarrassment or low self-esteem Surgery can help improve the alignment of the eyes even if a squint has been left untreated for a long time, but any vision problems may be permanent if they are not treated at a young age. Causes of squints The exact cause of a squint is not always known. Some people are born with a squint and others develop one later in life. Sometimes they run in families. In children, a squint is often caused by the eye attempting to overcome a vision problem, such as: short-sightedness – difficulty seeing things that are far away long-sightedness – difficulty seeing nearby objects astigmatism – where the front of the eye is unevenly curved, causing blurred vision Rarer causes of a squint include: some infections, such as measles some genetic conditions or syndromes, such as Down's syndrome developmental delays cerebral palsy other problems with the brain or nerves A squint can also sometimes be a symptom of a rare type of childhood eye cancer called retinoblastoma . Take your child to see a GP if they have a squint to rule out this condition. Page last reviewed: 02 May 2023 Next review due: 02 May 2026 Next : Surgery"

    "title": "Overview-Stammering",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stammering/",
    "text": "Overview - Stammering Contents Overview How it can affect you Treatment Stammering, also sometimes referred to as stuttering, affects speech and is relatively common in childhood. It can also can persist into adulthood. What is stammering? Stammering is when: you repeat sounds or syllables – for example, saying \"mu-mu-mu-mummy\" you make sounds longer – for example, \"mmmmmmummy\" a word gets stuck or does not come out at all Stammering varies in severity from person to person, and from situation to situation. Someone might have periods of stammering followed by times when they speak relatively fluently. Find out more about how stammering can affect you . Types of stammering There are 2 main types of stammering: developmental stammering – the most common type of stammering that happens in early childhood when speech and language skills are developing quickly acquired or late-onset stammering – is relatively rare and happens in older children and adults as a result of a head injury, stroke or progressive neurological condition. It can also be caused by certain drugs, medicines, or psychological or emotional trauma The information here focuses on developmental stammering. What causes stammering? It is not possible to say for sure why a child starts stammering, but it is not caused by anything the parents have done. Developmental and inherited factors may play a part, along with small differences in how efficiently the speech areas of the brain are working. Speech development Speech development is a complex process that involves communication between different areas of the brain, and between the brain and the muscles responsible for breathing and speaking. When every part of this system works well, the right words are spoken in the right order, with correct rhythm, pauses and emphasis. A child learning to construct simple sentences needs practice to develop the different speech areas in the brain and create the \"wiring\" (neural pathways) needed for the different parts to work well together. Stammering can happen if some parts of this developing system are not co-ordinated. This can cause repetitions and stoppages, particularly when the child has lots to say, is excited, or feels under pressure. As the brain continues to develop, stammering may resolve or the brain can compensate, which is why many children stop stammering as they get older. Sex differences and genes Stammering is more common in boys than girls. It is unclear why this is. Genes are also thought to have a role. Around 2 in 3 people who stammer have a family history of stammering, which suggests the genes a child inherits from their parents might make them more likely to develop a stammer. When to get help You should get advice if you have any concerns about your child's speech or language development. Treatment for stammering is often successful in pre-school age children, so it's important to get advice as soon as possible. Talk to a GP or health visitor about your concerns. If necessary, they may refer your child to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for an assessment. In many areas, you can phone children's speech and language services directly and refer your child yourself. Stamma (the British Stammering Association) has more information and support for people who stammer and parents of stammering children. For support or to find out about the services available in your area, call the helpline on 0808 802 0002 or start a webchat (Monday to Thursday 10am to 2pm and 4pm to 8pm). If you're an adult who stammers and it's having a significant impact on your social and work life, you may want to ask a GP to refer you to an SLT. Treatments for stammering There are different speech and language therapy approaches that can help people who stammer to speak more easily. You'll work with a therapist to choose a suitable plan tailored to your child or you. This may involve: creating an environment where your child feels more relaxed and confident about talking strategies to increase fluency and develop communication skills working on feelings associated with stammering, such as fear and anxiety Electronic devices to reduce stammering are also available and can help some older children and adults, but they're not usually available on the NHS. Find out more about treating stammering . Who's affected Studies suggest around 1 in 12 young children go through a phase of stammering. Around 2 in 3 children who stammer will go on to speak fluently, although it's difficult to predict when this will happen in a particular child. It's estimated that stammering affects around 1 in 50 adults, with men being around 3 to 4 times more likely to stammer than women.

These are much less common than skin infections. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if: You think you have a staph infection and: it's getting worse or spreading quickly it lasts more than a week you have a weakened immune system (for example, you've had an organ transplant or you're having chemotherapy) you keep getting staph infections You might need antibiotics to treat the infection. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment for staph infections Staph infections usually get better on their own, but you may need treatment from a GP if your symptoms do not get better after a week. You may need: antibiotic tablets, creams or eye drops a small procedure to have any boils, carbuncles or abscesses drained and cleaned a stye removed by a GP Some people may be referred to a specialist if treatment from a GP does not help. How staph infections are spread The bacteria that cause staph infections live harmlessly on many people's skin, often in the nose and armpits and on the buttocks. They usually only cause an infection if they get into the skin, such as through a bite or cut. Staph bacteria can spread to others through: close skin contact sharing things like towels or toothbrushes droplets in coughs and sneezes (but this is less common) Preventing staph infections It can be difficult to prevent staph infections because many people have the bacteria on their skin. But there are things you can do to lower your chances of getting an infection or spreading the bacteria to others. Do wash your hands with soap and water regularly keep your skin clean by having a bath or shower every day keep any cuts clean and covered use disposable tissues to blow your nose Don’t do not share towels, washcloths, bed linen, toothbrushes or razors Page last reviewed: 11 February 2025 Next review due: 11 February 2028"

    "title": "Anabolic steroid misuse",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anabolic-steroid-misuse/",
    "text": "Anabolic steroid misuse Anabolic steroids are prescription-only medicines that are sometimes taken without medical advice to increase muscle mass and improve athletic performance. If used in this way, they can cause serious side effects and addiction. Anabolic steroids are manufactured drugs that copy the effects of the male hormone testosterone. They have limited medical uses and are not the same as corticosteroids , a different type of steroid drug that's more commonly prescribed. Are anabolic steroids illegal? Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, which can only be issued by pharmacists with a prescription. It's legal to have anabolic steroids for personal use. They can also be imported or exported, as long as this is carried out in person. This means they can't be posted or delivered by a courier or freight service. However, it's illegal to possess, import or export anabolic steroids if it's believed you're supplying or selling them. This includes giving them to friends. The penalty is an unlimited fine, or even a prison sentence of up to 14 years. In professional sport, most organisations ban anabolic steroid use and test competitors for banned steroids. If you do test positive, you may be banned from competing professionally. Why people misuse anabolic steroids Anabolic steroids can be used as performance-enhancing drugs that increase muscle mass and decrease fat, as well as causing many undesirable effects. Some people take them regularly to improve their physical performance and build up their bodies. However, people of all ages have been known to misuse these drugs, including adolescent boys who suffer from body dysmorphic disorder . This is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. These flaws are often unnoticeable to others. People who have body dysmorphic disorder may take anabolic steroids because they don't see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough. Some people believe taking anabolic steroids will help them become fit and healthy. This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit. How anabolic steroids are taken Anabolic steroids are usually injected into a muscle or taken by mouth as tablets, but they also come as creams or gels that are applied to the skin. Many people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and believe that by taking the drugs in certain ways they can avoid side effects. Or they may take additional medicines to try to counter the side effects. Users might: Take the drugs for a period of time and then stop for a rest period before starting again. This is known as \"cycling\". Take more than one type of anabolic steroid at a time, known as \"stacking\", which they believe makes the steroids work better. Do a combination of both stacking and cycling, known as \"pyramiding\", where they start off taking a low dose of one or more anabolic steroids, and then increase the dose over time up to a maximum dose. They then stop taking them for a rest period to give the body a break before starting the cycle again. But there is no evidence that any of these methods actually reduce side effects and harms from taking anabolic steroids. Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time. Side effects of anabolic steroids Regularly taking anabolic steroids can lead to physical and psychological changes in both men and women, as well as potentially dangerous medical conditions. Physical effects Effects of anabolic steroids in men can include: reduced sperm count infertility shrunken testicles erectile dysfunction hair loss breast development increased risk of prostate cancer severe acne stomach pain In women, anabolic steroids can cause: facial hair growth and body hair loss of breasts swelling of the clitoris a deepened voice an increased sex drive problems with periods hair loss severe acne In addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions: heart attack or stroke liver or kidney problems or failure high blood pressure (hypertension) blood clots fluid retention high cholesterol Psychological effects Misusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects: aggressive behaviour mood swings paranoia manic behaviour hallucinations and delusions Stunted growth in adolescents Anabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth. Sharing needles As anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles. These are the same risks associated with recreational drug use, and include: damage to veins, leading to ulcers or gangrene hepatitis B infection hepatitis C infection HIV transmission Addiction Anabolic steroids are addictive. This means you can crave the drug, require more to get the same effect, and have withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop taking it. A person who is addicted to anabolic steroids will want to keep using them despite experiencing unpleasant physical side effects. When doctors prescribe steroid medication, they always advise coming off the medication slowly by gradually reducing the dose. Coming off anabolic steroids suddenly can result in withdrawal symptoms that include: depression and apathy feelings of anxiety difficulty concentrating insomnia anorexia decreased sex drive extreme tiredness (fatigue) headaches muscle and joint pain Getting help You should see a GP if you think you're addicted to anabolic steroids. Treatment for an addiction to anabolic steroids will be similar to that of other types of addiction. The GP may refer you to a specially trained drugs counsellor. They'll discuss your addiction with you, how to safely stop taking steroids, and any obstacles you may face when trying to stop, plus tips for dealing with those obstacles.

Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for Stevens-Johnson syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome is treated in hospital, often in an intensive care unit. Without treatment, the symptoms can become life-threatening. If it's thought Stevens-Johnson syndrome is being caused by a medicine you're taking, the medicine will be stopped. You'll have treatment to relieve your symptoms, which may include: fluids into a vein to prevent dehydration creams and dressings to moisturise and protect the skin strong painkillers to help ease any pain medicines to control inflammation and prevent infection Recovering from Stevens-Johnson syndrome It may take several weeks or months for you to fully recover from Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It's likely you'll feel very tired for a few weeks after leaving hospital. Your skin will usually take about 2 or 3 weeks to heal, but it can sometimes take longer if you get a skin infection. If your symptoms were caused by a reaction to a medicine, you'll need to avoid taking that medicine (and possibly other similar ones) for the rest of your life. Your doctor will be able to discuss this with you. Complications of Stevens-Johnson syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome can cause serious complications including: skin problems like a skin infection, changes in skin colour and scarring problems with organs, such as the lungs, liver and kidneys eye problems, such as long-term inflammation or sight problems problems with the vagina or penis caused by scarring Page last reviewed: 21 June 2022 Next review due: 21 June 2025"

    "text": "Overview - Stillbirth Contents Overview Causes What happens if your unborn baby dies Preventing stillbirth A stillbirth is when a baby is born dead after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy. It happens in around 1 in every 250 births in England. If the baby dies before 24 completed weeks, it's known as a miscarriage or late foetal loss. Contact your midwife or doctor straight away if you're pregnant and worried about your baby – for example, if you've noticed your baby moving less than usual. Don't wait until the next day. If your baby is moving less, it can be a sign that something's wrong and needs to be checked out. Causes of stillbirth Some stillbirths are linked to complications with the placenta, a birth defect or with the mother's health. For others, no cause is found. Read more about causes of stillbirth . When a baby dies before they're born If your baby has died, you may be able to wait for labour to start naturally or your labour may be induced. If your health is at risk, the baby may need to be delivered as soon as possible. It's rare for a stillborn baby to be delivered by caesarean section . Read more about what to expect if your baby dies before birth . After a stillbirth After a stillbirth, decisions about what to do are very personal. There's no right or wrong way to respond. A specialist midwife will talk with you about what you want to do – for example, holding the baby or taking photographs. They can also discuss the tests you may be offered to find out why your baby died and give you information about registering the birth. Read more about what happens after a stillbirth , including information about baby-loss support groups. Preventing stillbirths Not all stillbirths can be prevented, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk, such as: not smoking avoiding drugs and alcohol during pregnancy – these can seriously affect your baby's development, and increase the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth not going to sleep on your back after 28 weeks – don't worry if you wake up on your back, just turn onto your side before you go back to sleep attending all your antenatal appointments so that midwives can monitor the growth and wellbeing of your baby taking folic acid before and up to 12 weeks of pregnancy making sure all your vaccinations are up to date – speak to your midwife or GP for advice limiting the amount of caffeine you consume during pregnancy Video: Coping with grief after a stillbirth In this video Lisa and Jason describe how they coped with a stillbirth Media last reviewed: 16 April 2024 Media review due: 16 April 2027 Page last reviewed: 24 April 2024 Next review due: 24 April 2027 Next : Causes"

Removing stingers, ticks or caterpillars If anything is left on or in your skin, the first thing you need to do is remove it carefully. How to remove a bee, wasp or hornet stinger Brush or scrape the stinger sideways with your fingernail or the edge of a bank card. Do not use tweezers to pull out a stinger as you could squeeze poison out of it. Wash the area with soap and water. How to remove a tick Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool (if you have one), grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. Slowly pull upwards, taking care not to squeeze the tick or leave any of its mouth in your skin. Dispose of it when you've removed it. Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water. Credit: Shotshop GmbH / Alamy Stock Photo Image no longer available for purchase but license expires: 09th May 2028 How to remove caterpillar hairs Gently remove the caterpillar using tweezers or a pen. Try not to disturb it as it'll release more hairs. Rinse your skin with running water and allow it to air dry. Use sticky tape on the skin to pick up any remaining hairs. Take off any jewellery in case your skin becomes swollen. Take off your clothes and wash them at a high temperature. Easing your symptoms If there's nothing in your skin, or you've removed it, wash your skin with soap and water to help lower the chance of infection. The bite or sting should get better in a few days. There are some things you can do to ease your symptoms. Do put an ice pack wrapped in a cloth, or a clean cloth soaked in cold water, on the bite or sting for at least 20 minutes, if it's swollen keep the area raised if you can take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen if the sting is painful use antihistamines to relieve any itching (but do not use antihistamine cream if you had caterpillar hairs on your skin) use a hydrocortisone cream to reduce itching and swelling Don’t do not scratch the bite or sting, as it could get infected do not use home remedies such as bicarbonate of soda to treat the bite or sting Non-urgent advice: See a pharmacist if: You or your child aged 1 year or older has an insect bite or sting and: skin around it feels hot when you touch it or looks red – redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin it's painful the area looks swollen there's pus or fluid coming out of the bite or sting A pharmacist can recommend treatments, such as antihistamines and steroid creams, and give the same antibiotics as a GP if the bite or sting is infected.

    "text": "Overview - Stomach ulcer Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Stomach ulcers, also known as gastric ulcers, are sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. You can also get ulcers in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach, which are called duodenal ulcers. Stomach ulcers and duodenal ulcers (sometimes called peptic ulcers) cause the same symptoms and treatment for both is the same. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the tummy (abdomen). But stomach ulcers aren't always painful and some people may experience other symptoms, such as indigestion , heartburn and acid reflux and feeling sick. When to seek medical advice You should visit your GP if you think you may have a stomach ulcer. Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately if: you are passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools you have a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 if: you are vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance, similar to coffee grounds These could be a sign of a serious complication, such as internal bleeding. Causes of stomach ulcers Stomach ulcers happen when there’s damage to the layer that protects the stomach lining from the acids in your stomach. This is usually a result of: an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria taking anti-inflammatory medicines ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they're taken for a long time or at high doses It used to be thought that stress or certain foods might cause stomach ulcers, but there's little evidence to suggest this is the case. Stomach ulcers can affect anyone but are more common in people aged 60 or over. Men are more affected than women. How stomach ulcers are treated Treatment will depend on what caused the ulcer. Most people will be prescribed a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of acid in their stomach. You’ll also need antibiotics if your ulcers were caused by a H. pylori infection. Stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed. Possible complications Complications of stomach ulcers are relatively uncommon, but they can be very serious and potentially life threatening. The main complications include: bleeding at the site of the ulcer the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splitting open (perforation) the ulcer blocking the movement of food through the digestive system (gastric obstruction) Read more about the complications of stomach ulcers .

Symptoms of a strep A infection Common symptoms of strep A include: flu-like symptoms , such as a high temperature, swollen glands or an aching body sore throat (strep throat or tonsillitis ) a rash that feels rough, like sandpaper ( scarlet fever ) scabs and sores ( impetigo ) pain and swelling ( cellulitis ) severe muscle aches nausea and vomiting Strep A infections are more common in children, but adults can also sometimes get them. Most strep A infections are not serious and can be treated with antibiotics. But rarely, the infection can cause serious problems. This is called invasive group A strep (iGAS). What to do if your child is unwell It can be difficult to tell when a child is seriously ill, but the main thing is to trust your instincts. You know better than anyone else what your child is usually like, so you'll know when something is seriously wrong. If your child does not seem to be seriously ill, you can usually look after them at home. They should feel better in a few days. If they're uncomfortable, you can give them children's paracetamol or children's ibuprofen . Check the leaflet to make sure the medicine is suitable for your child and to see how much to give them. A pharmacist can give you advice about how to ease your child's symptoms and whether you need to see a doctor.

Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for a strep A infection Most strep A infections can be easily treated with antibiotics . If you or your child has a strep A infection, you should stay away from nursery, school or work for 24 hours after you start taking antibiotics. This will help stop the infection spreading to other people. Serious strep A infections (invasive group A strep, iGAS) need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics. How you get strep A infections Strep A infections are spread by close contact with an infected person. They can be passed on through coughs and sneezes or from a wound. In some people, the bacteria live in the body without causing symptoms or making them feel unwell. But they can still pass the bacteria on to others. Things that might make you more at risk of strep A infections include: a weakened immune system open sores or wounds some viral infections, such as a cold or flu How to avoid getting infections Infections like strep A can easily be spread to other people.

Information: It's not always possible to prevent stretch marks. The best way to reduce your chance of getting them is by maintaining a healthy weight. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have large stretch marks and: more fat on your chest and tummy, but slim arms and legs a build-up of fat on the back of your neck and shoulders a red, puffy, rounded face These could be symptoms of Cushing's syndrome .

It can also can persist into adulthood. What is stammering? Stammering is when: you repeat sounds or syllables – for example, saying \"mu-mu-mu-mummy\" you make sounds longer – for example, \"mmmmmmummy\" a word gets stuck or does not come out at all Stammering varies in severity from person to person, and from situation to situation. Someone might have periods of stammering followed by times when they speak relatively fluently. Find out more about how stammering can affect you . Types of stammering There are 2 main types of stammering: developmental stammering – the most common type of stammering that happens in early childhood when speech and language skills are developing quickly acquired or late-onset stammering – is relatively rare and happens in older children and adults as a result of a head injury, stroke or progressive neurological condition. It can also be caused by certain drugs, medicines, or psychological or emotional trauma The information here focuses on developmental stammering. What causes stammering? It is not possible to say for sure why a child starts stammering, but it is not caused by anything the parents have done. Developmental and inherited factors may play a part, along with small differences in how efficiently the speech areas of the brain are working. Speech development Speech development is a complex process that involves communication between different areas of the brain, and between the brain and the muscles responsible for breathing and speaking. When every part of this system works well, the right words are spoken in the right order, with correct rhythm, pauses and emphasis. A child learning to construct simple sentences needs practice to develop the different speech areas in the brain and create the \"wiring\" (neural pathways) needed for the different parts to work well together. Stammering can happen if some parts of this developing system are not co-ordinated. This can cause repetitions and stoppages, particularly when the child has lots to say, is excited, or feels under pressure. As the brain continues to develop, stammering may resolve or the brain can compensate, which is why many children stop stammering as they get older. Sex differences and genes Stammering is more common in boys than girls. It is unclear why this is. Genes are also thought to have a role. Around 2 in 3 people who stammer have a family history of stammering, which suggests the genes a child inherits from their parents might make them more likely to develop a stammer. When to get help You should get advice if you have any concerns about your child's speech or language development. Treatment for stammering is often successful in pre-school age children, so it's important to get advice as soon as possible. Talk to a GP or health visitor about your concerns. If necessary, they may refer your child to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for an assessment. In many areas, you can phone children's speech and language services directly and refer your child yourself. Stamma (the British Stammering Association) has more information and support for people who stammer and parents of stammering children. For support or to find out about the services available in your area, call the helpline on 0808 802 0002 or start a webchat (Monday to Thursday 10am to 2pm and 4pm to 8pm). If you're an adult who stammers and it's having a significant impact on your social and work life, you may want to ask a GP to refer you to an SLT. Treatments for stammering There are different speech and language therapy approaches that can help people who stammer to speak more easily. You'll work with a therapist to choose a suitable plan tailored to your child or you. This may involve: creating an environment where your child feels more relaxed and confident about talking strategies to increase fluency and develop communication skills working on feelings associated with stammering, such as fear and anxiety Electronic devices to reduce stammering are also available and can help some older children and adults, but they're not usually available on the NHS. Find out more about treating stammering . Who's affected Studies suggest around 1 in 12 young children go through a phase of stammering. Around 2 in 3 children who stammer will go on to speak fluently, although it's difficult to predict when this will happen in a particular child. It's estimated that stammering affects around 1 in 50 adults, with men being around 3 to 4 times more likely to stammer than women.

Hold it against your eye for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat this 2 to 4 times a day. To relieve the pain, take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen . Do not give aspirin to children under 16. Avoid wearing contact lenses and eye make-up until the stye has burst and healed. Important: Do not burst a stye Do not try to burst a stye or remove an eyelash yourself. This can spread the infection. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: a stye does not get better within a few weeks Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: a stye is very painful or swollen it affects your vision your eye is producing pus the infection has spread to your eye or eyelid You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment from a GP If you have a stye, the GP may: burst the stye with a thin, sterilised needle remove the eyelash closest to the stye refer you to an eye specialist in hospital How to prevent a stye You can help avoid stye by keeping your eyes clean. Styes are often caused by bacteria infecting an eyelash follicle or eyelid gland. You're also more likely to get a stye if you have long-term blepharitis or rosacea . Do wash your face and remove eye make-up before bed keep your eyelids and eyelashes clean, especially if you have blepharitis wash your hands before putting contact lenses in or taking them out Don’t do not share towels or flannels with someone who has a stye do not rub your eyes if you have not recently washed your hands Page last reviewed: 18 April 2024 Next review due: 18 April 2027"

    "text": "Overview - Subarachnoid haemorrhage Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Recovery A subarachnoid haemorrhage is an uncommon type of stroke caused by bleeding on the surface of the brain. It's a very serious condition and can be fatal. Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage There are usually no warning signs, but a subarachnoid haemorrhage sometimes happens during physical effort or straining, such as coughing, going to the toilet, lifting something heavy or having sex. The main symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage include: a sudden severe headache unlike anything you’ve experienced before a stiff neck feeling and being sick sensitivity to light (photophobia) blurred or double vision stroke-like symptoms – such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking) A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone in your care has these symptoms. How a subarachnoid haemorrhage is treated A person with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage needs a CT scan in hospital to check for signs of bleeding around the brain. If a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed or strongly suspected, you're likely to be transferred to a specialist neurosciences unit. Medicine will usually be given to help prevent short-term complications, and a procedure to repair the source of the bleeding may be carried out. Read more about: diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage treating a subarachnoid haemorrhage Causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages Subarachnoid haemorrhages are often caused by a burst blood vessel in the brain (a ruptured brain aneurysm ). It's not known exactly why brain aneurysms develop in some people. But certain risk factors have been identified, including: smoking high blood pressure excessive alcohol consumption Severe head injuries can cause subarachnoid bleeding, but this is a separate problem known as a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. Read more about the causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages . Who's affected? Subarachnoid haemorrhages can happen at any age, but are most common in people aged between 45 and 70. Slightly more women are affected than men. Subarachnoid haemorrhages are also more common in black people compared to other ethnic groups. This could be because black people are more likely to have high blood pressure. Reducing your risk There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. The most effective steps you can take to reduce your chances of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage are: stop smoking – your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service for help and advice, or you can call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 moderate your alcohol units (alcohol consumption) take steps to prevent high blood pressure – such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and losing weight if you're overweight Possible complications A subarachnoid haemorrhage can cause both short and long-term complications. Serious short-term complications can include further bleeding at the site of any aneurysm and brain damage caused by a reduction in blood supply to the brain. Long-term complications include: epilepsy – where a person has repeated seizures (fits) problems with certain mental functions, such as memory, planning and concentration changes in mood, such as depression Read more about the complications of a subarachnoid haemorrhage . Outlook Although the outlook for subarachnoid haemorrhage has improved in the last few decades, it can be fatal, and people who survive can be left with long-term problems. Recovering after a subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be a slow and frustrating process, and it's common to have problems such as: extreme tiredness headaches problems sleeping Read more about recovering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage .

    "text": "Overview - Subdural haematoma Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Recovery A subdural haematoma is a serious condition where blood collects between the skull and the surface of the brain. It's usually caused by a head injury. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma can include: a headache that keeps getting worse feeling and being sick confusion personality changes, such as being unusually aggressive or having rapid mood swings feeling drowsy loss of consciousness The symptoms can develop soon after a severe head injury (acute subdural haematoma), or very occasionally a few days or weeks after a more minor head injury (subacute or chronic subdural haematoma). Read more about the symptoms of a subdural haematoma . When to seek medical advice You should always seek emergency medical treatment after a severe head injury . Go to your nearest A&E department or call 999. If you develop the symptoms above any time after a minor head injury, you should also go to your nearest A&E department or call 999 for an ambulance as soon as possible. A subdural haematoma can be very serious and needs to be assessed as quickly as possible. Read more about diagnosing subdural haematomas . What causes subdural haematomas? A subdural haematoma occurs when a blood vessel in the space between the skull and the brain (the subdural space) is damaged. Blood escapes from the blood vessel, leading to the formation of a blood clot (haematoma) that places pressure on the brain and damages it. Head injuries that cause subdural haematomas are often severe, such as those from a car crash, fall or violent assault. But minor bumps to the head can also lead to a subdural haematoma in a few cases. A minor head injury is more likely to lead to a subdural haematoma if you're over 60, taking anticoagulant (\"blood-thinning\") medicine or have a history of alcohol misuse . Read more about the causes of a subdural haematoma . How subdural haematomas are treated Subdural haematomas usually need to be treated with surgery as soon as possible. The 2 most widely used surgical techniques for subdural haematomas are: craniotomy – a section of the skull is temporarily removed so the surgeon can access and remove the haematoma burr holes – a small hole is drilled into the skull and a tube is inserted through the hole to help drain the haematoma In a few cases, very small subdural haematomas may be carefully monitored first to see if they heal without having an operation. Read more about treating subdural haematomas . Outlook A subdural haematoma is a serious condition that carries a high risk of death, particularly in older people and those whose brain was severely damaged. Acute subdural haematomas are the most serious type because they're often associated with significant damage to the brain. Those who survive an acute subdural haematoma may take a long time to recover, and may be left with physical disabilities and cognitive problems such as memory and speech problems. The outlook is generally better for subacute and chronic haematomas. Most people who are fit enough to have surgery eventually make a full recovery. But because many people with these types of haematoma are older, they may be too frail to have treatment. Read more about recovering from a subdural haematoma .

    "title": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids/",
    "text": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) – sometimes known as cot death – is the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. In the UK, around 200 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly every year. This statistic may sound alarming, but SIDS is rare and the risk of your baby dying from it is low. SIDS can affect babies aged up to 12 months old. Most deaths happen during the first 6 months of a baby's life. Infants born prematurely or with a low birthweight are at greater risk. SIDS also tends to be slightly more common in baby boys. SIDS usually occurs when a baby is asleep, although it can occasionally happen while they're awake. Parents can reduce the risk of SIDS by not smoking while pregnant or after the baby is born, and always placing the baby on their back when they sleep. Find out how to stop smoking . SIDS is different from sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), which is when a child over 1 year old dies and a cause cannot be found. SUDC is rare and the cause is not known. The charity SUDC.UK offers support if you've been affected by SUDC . What causes SIDS? The exact cause of SIDS is unknown, but it's thought to be down to a combination of factors. Experts believe SIDS occurs at a particular stage in a baby's development and that it affects babies vulnerable to certain environmental stresses. This vulnerability may be caused by being born prematurely or having a low birthweight, or because of other reasons that have not been identified yet. Environmental stresses could include tobacco smoke, getting tangled in bedding, a minor illness or a breathing obstruction. There's also an association between sleeping with your baby on a sofa or chair and SIDS. Babies who die of SIDS are thought to have problems in the way they respond to these stresses and how they regulate their heart rate, breathing and temperature. Although the cause of SIDS is not fully understood, there are a number of things you can do to reduce the risk. What can I do to help prevent SIDS? Do always place your baby on their back to sleep place your baby in the \"feet to foot\" position – with their feet touching the end of the cot, Moses basket or pram keep your baby's head uncovered – tuck your baby's blanket securely under their arms so the blanket cannot move and cover their head keep your baby, or any baby you're caring for, in the same room as you while they're sleeping until they're at least 6 months old make sure there are no pillows or duvets near your baby if you share a bed with them keep other children and pets out of the bed if you share a bed with your baby use a mattress that's firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition breastfeed your baby, if you can – see benefits of breastfeeding for more information make sure you use a sling or baby-carrier safely – The Lullaby Trust has more information Don’t do not share a bed with your baby if you or your partner smoke or take recreational drugs, have had 2 or more units of alcohol or have taken medicine that causes drowsiness do not share a bed with your baby if they weighed under 2.5kg when they were born do not smoke during pregnancy or let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby – both before and after birth do not sleep on a sofa or armchair with your baby do not let your baby get too hot or too cold – a room temperature of 16C to 20C, with light bedding or a lightweight baby sleeping bag, will provide a comfortable sleeping environment for your baby Read more about reducing the risk of SIDS . Seeking medical advice if your baby is unwell Babies often have minor illnesses that you do not need to worry about. Give your baby plenty of fluids to drink and do not let them get too hot. If you're worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call NHS 111 for advice. Read more about spotting signs of serious illness in children . Immediate action required: Dial 999 for an ambulance if your baby: stops breathing or turns blue is struggling for breath is unconscious or seems unaware of what's going on will not wake up has a fit for the first time, even if they seem to recover Support services If a baby or child dies suddenly and unexpectedly, there will need to be an investigation into how and why they died. A post-mortem examination will usually be necessary, which can be very distressing for the family. The police and healthcare professionals work closely to investigate unexpected infant deaths and ensure the family is supported. They should be able to put you in touch with local sources of help and support. Many people find talking to others who have had similar experiences helps them to cope with their bereavement. If you've been affected by SIDS, the Lullaby Trust provides advice and support for bereaved families. Specially trained advisers are available on its helpline – the number is 0808 802 6868 and it's open Monday to Friday (10am to 5pm), and at weekends and public holidays (6pm to 10pm).

It's not usually serious, but some people may need treatment. Causes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) happens when the electrical system that controls your heart rhythm is not working properly. This causes your heart to suddenly beat much faster. It can then slow down abruptly. A normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). But with SVT your heart rate suddenly goes above 100bpm. This can happen when you're resting or doing exercise. Symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) Having supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) means your heart suddenly beats faster. This: usually lasts for a few minutes, but can sometimes last for several hours can happen several times a day or once a year – it varies can be triggered by caffeine, alcohol or drugs – but often there's no obvious trigger can happen at any age, but often starts for the first time in children and young adults – many people have their first symptoms between 25 and 40 years old You may get no other symptoms, but sometimes people also: have chest pain or discomfort feel weak, breathless, lightheaded or dizzy feel tired Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you keep getting a fast heartbeat It's important to get it checked out. You might need a test, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) , to find out what's going on. Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you've been diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and your episode has lasted longer than usual you have a fast heartbeat with shortness of breath, chest pain or feeling faint You need to go to hospital for treatment immediately. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Things you can do to help with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) If your episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) only last a few minutes and do not bother you, you may not need treatment.

    "text": "Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) Excessive sweating is common and can affect the whole body or just certain areas. Sometimes it gets better with age but there are things you can do and treatments that can help. What is excessive sweating? It's normal to sweat if you get hot or do exercise, but you may be sweating excessively if you're sweating when your body does not need to cool down. Excessive sweating can happen for no obvious reason, because of another condition you may have, or as a side effect of a medicine you're taking. Things you can do to help with excessive sweating Do wear loose-fitting clothes to minimise signs of sweating wear socks that absorb moisture and change your socks at least twice a day if possible wear leather shoes and try to wear different shoes day to day Don’t do not wear tight clothes or synthetic fabrics – for example, nylon do not wear enclosed boots or sports shoes that may cause your feet to sweat more do not do things that might make your sweating worse – for example, drinking alcohol or eating spicy food A pharmacist can help with excessive sweating You can see a pharmacist about excessive sweating. You can buy things without a prescription, such as: stronger antiperspirants instead of deodorant armpit or sweat shields to protect your clothing foot powders for sweaty feet soap substitutes that are more gentle on your skin Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if you're sweating excessively and: things you can do yourself are not helping it's lasted for at least 6 months it stops you from getting on with your daily activities it happens at least once a week it happens at night (you're having night sweats ) you have a family history of excessive sweating you're taking medicine for another condition The GP may refer you for tests if they think another condition may be causing your sweating. Treating severe excessive sweating If there's no obvious cause for your sweating, and nothing seems to be helping, then you may be referred to a specialist (dermatologist). They may recommend other treatments that you can try, such as: taking tablets that reduce sweating treating the areas with a weak electric current passed through water or on a wet pad (iontophoresis) having botox injections for sweating under the armpits (this may not be available on the NHS) surgery – for example, removal of the sweat glands If your sweating is caused by another condition, any treatment you may need will depend on what's causing it.

    "text": "Syphilis Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). If it's not treated, it can cause serious and potentially life-threatening problems. Check if you have syphilis The symptoms of syphilis are often mild and hard to notice. They tend to change over time and may come and go. Symptoms of syphilis include: small sores (ulcers) on your penis, vagina, or around your bottom (anus) – these are usually painless and you may only have one of them sores in other areas, including in your mouth or on your lips, hands or bottom white or grey warty growths most commonly on your penis, vagina or around your anus a rash on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet that can sometimes spread all over your body – this is not usually itchy white patches in your mouth flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headaches and tiredness swollen glands patchy hair loss on the head, beard and eyebrows It can take 3 weeks or more for the symptoms of syphilis to appear after you're infected. Sometimes the symptoms can improve or go away completely, but if you have not been treated the infection is still in your body. This means you can still pass it on and you're at risk of getting serious problems later on. Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if: you or a sexual partner have symptoms of syphilis a sexual partner has told you they have syphilis or another sexually transmitted infection (STI) you've recently had sex with a new partner and did not use a condom you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant and think you might have syphilis you've injected drugs using a needle that's been used by someone who might have syphilis Having a test is the only way to confirm if you have syphilis. If you do, treatment will need to be started as soon as possible. Tests for STIs are free on the NHS. Find a sexual health clinic Other ways to get a syphilis test You can also have a syphilis test: during a pregnancy (antenatal) appointment, if you're pregnant using a self-test kit – you may be able to order a kit online from your local STI testing and treatment service or buy one from a pharmacy You use a self-test kit at home and send it to a lab to be tested. What happens during a syphilis test If you have symptoms of syphilis, a doctor or nurse will check your penis, vagina and bottom (anus) for syphilis sores (ulcers). They may use a swab (like a cotton bud) to collect a fluid sample from any sores. They'll also check the rest of your body for other signs of syphilis like a rash, sores or wart-like growths. They may also take a blood sample. You may also have tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the same time. Information: Contacting sexual partners If you have syphilis, your current and any recent sexual partners will also need to be tested and treated. The GP or sexual health clinic can advise you about contacting your sexual partners. This can be done without naming you. Treatment for syphilis Syphilis is treated with antibiotics , which you may have as injections, tablets or capsules. Treatment may be started before your test result is known. How long you need treatment for will depend on the stage of your syphilis. In some people, treatment can cause flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headache and aching muscles. This usually lasts for up to 24 hours. You'll need to go back to the GP surgery or sexual health clinic 6 and 12 weeks after starting treatment to be retested. Important Do not have sex (vaginal, anal or oral) until you and your partner have finished treatment and tests have shown treatment has worked. Complications of syphilis If it's not treated, syphilis can cause serious and potentially life-threatening problems including: heart problems like angina , aortic aneurysm and heart failure brain problems like fits (seizures), memory problems, personality changes and dementia nerve problems like shooting pains, pins and needles , joint pain and gradual damage the joints problems with the skin, bones, testicles, liver and any other organ Some of these problems may not appear for many years after being infected with syphilis. Syphilis during pregnancy If you're pregnant and have syphilis, you can pass it on to your baby before they're born. This is known as congenital syphilis. Having syphilis during pregnancy can also increase your risk of miscarriage , premature birth and stillbirth . You'll be offered screening for syphilis if you're pregnant so it can be found and treated before it causes any serious problems. How you get syphilis The most common way of getting syphilis is by having unprotected sex (vaginal, anal or oral sex without a condom) with someone who's infected. You can get the infection if you come into contact with an ulcer on their penis, vagina, bottom (anus), or inside their mouth. It's also possible for syphilis to be passed on: to an unborn baby during pregnancy (congenital syphilis) by injecting drugs with a needle that's been used by an infected person during a blood or organ transplant (this is rare as all blood and organ donations in the UK are checked for syphilis) Preventing syphilis There are some things you can do to avoid getting syphilis and passing it on to others. Do use a condom when you have vaginal or anal sex use a condom to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina if you have oral sex make sure you complete treatment if you or your partner have syphilis Don’t do not share sex toys (or wash and cover them with a new condom before anyone else uses them) do not share needles if you inject drugs Page last reviewed: 25 May 2022 Next review due: 25 May 2025"

It may feel dull and achy most of the time, with occasional sharp pains. The pain may be worse: while you're sitting down when you sit down or stand up when you bend forward when you're having a poo during sex during your period You may also find it difficult to sleep and carry out daily activities. How you can ease tailbone (coccyx) pain yourself Tailbone (coccyx) pain may improve after a few weeks, but it can sometimes last longer. There are some things you can do to help ease the pain. Do sit correctly – maintain good posture with your lower back supported use a specially designed coccyx cushion when sitting – sitting on an exercise ball can also help lie on your side to reduce the pressure on your coccyx try pelvic floor exercises (particularly important during pregnancy) use an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on the affected area for 20 to 30 minutes – you can also use a heat pack for longer use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen to help reduce the pain use a laxative to soften your poo if the pain is worse when pooing – ask a pharmacist for a laxative that softens poo Don’t do not sit for a long time do not wear clothes that are tight around your bottom and lower back, like some types of jeans Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: tailbone (coccyx) pain has not improved after a few weeks of trying treatments at home the pain is affecting your daily activities you have a high temperature, tailbone pain and pain in another area, such as in your tummy or lower back Treatments for tailbone (coccyx) pain Further treatments are available if simple things like pelvic floor exercises and ibuprofen have not helped your tailbone (coccyx) pain. The 2 treatments that may be recommended first are: physiotherapy – the muscles around the coccyx can be manipulated to help ease the pain corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injections – into the joint that attaches the coccyx to the bottom of your spine; you'll usually have a maximum of 2 injections given on consecutive months If physiotherapy and injections do not help reduce the pain, surgery to remove part or all of your coccyx may be recommended.

    "text": "Tay-Sachs disease Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited condition that mainly affects babies and young children. It stops the nerves working properly and is usually fatal. It used to be most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (most Jewish people in the UK), but many cases now occur in people from other ethnic backgrounds. Symptoms Symptoms of infantile Tay-Sachs disease usually start when a child is 3 to 6 months old. The main symptoms include: being overly startled by noises and movement being very slow to reach milestones like learning to crawl, and losing skills they have already learnt floppiness and weakness, which keeps getting worse until they're unable to move (paralysis) difficulty swallowing loss of vision or hearing muscle stiffness seizures (fits) The condition is usually fatal by around 3 to 5 years of age, often due to complications of a lung infection (pneumonia) . Rarer types of Tay-Sachs disease start later in childhood (juvenile Tay-Sachs disease) or early adulthood (late-onset Tay-Sachs disease). The late-onset type doesn't always shorten life expectancy. How it's inherited Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a problem in a child's genes that means their nerves stop working properly. A child can only have it if both parents have this faulty gene. The parents themselves don't usually have any symptoms – this is known as being a \"carrier\". If 2 people who are carriers have a child, there's a: 1 in 4 (25%) chance the child won't inherit any faulty genes and won't have Tay-Sachs disease or be able to pass it on 1 in 2 (50%) chance the child inherits a faulty gene from one parent and becomes a carrier, but won't have the condition themselves 1 in 4 (25%) chance the child inherits a faulty gene from both parents and develops Tay-Sachs disease When to get medical advice Speak to your GP if: you're planning a pregnancy and you or your partner have an Ashkenazi Jewish background, a history of Tay-Sachs disease in either of your families, or you know you're carriers you're pregnant and concerned your baby could have Tay-Sachs disease – you can also speak to your midwife for advice you're worried your child might have symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease – especially if someone in your family had it If you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you may be referred for genetic and genomic testing to see if you're at risk of having a child with Tay-Sachs disease and to talk to a genetics counsellor about your options. If your child has possible symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease, a blood test can show if they have it. Treatments There's currently no cure for Tay-Sachs disease. The aim of treatment is to make living with it as comfortable as possible. You'll see a team of specialists, who will help come up with a treatment plan for your child. Treatments may include: medicines for seizures and stiffness speech and language therapy for feeding and swallowing problems – sometimes special bottles or a feeding tube may be needed physiotherapy to help with stiffness and improve coughing (to reduce the risk of pneumonia) antibiotics to treat infections like pneumonia if they occur Your care team will talk to you about end of life care , such as where you'd like your child to receive care and if you'd like them to be resuscitated if their lungs stop working. Further information and advice You can get more information and support from: the Cure & Action for Tay-Sachs (CATS) Foundation Metabolic Support UK Genetic Alliance UK the National Tay-Sachs & Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD) – an American foundation for people with Tay-Sachs disease If you're interested in finding out more about research into treatments for Tay-Sachs disease, ask your care team about any research you might be able to get involved in. Information about your child If your child has Tay-Sachs disease, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

A Mantoux test is a skin test where a small amount of liquid is injected under the skin in your arm. This liquid will cause a small reaction on your skin if you have TB. Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) The main treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is to take antibiotics for at least 6 months. If TB has spread to your brain, spinal cord or the area around your heart, you may also need to take steroid medicine for a few weeks. If you have TB but do not have symptoms (latent TB) you usually need to take antibiotics for 3 to 6 months . Important It's important to take your antibiotics correctly and until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, TB could come back. Causes of tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria. It can spread through close contact with people who have TB and have symptoms (active TB). When someone with active TB coughs, they release small droplets containing the bacteria. You can catch TB if you regularly breathe in these droplets over a long period of time. Some people have TB in their body but do not get ill or have any symptoms (latent TB). This type of TB cannot be spread to others, but it can turn into active TB in the future. People who are more likely to get TB Anyone can get TB, but some people are more likely to get it or get more seriously ill from it, including people who: spend a lot of time with someone who has active TB, such as people living in the same house were born in or lived in an area where TB is more common have a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV, a kidney transplant or who are having certain treatment like chemotherapy are under 5 years of age live in overcrowded or unhealthy conditions, such as people who are homeless regularly smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs have had TB before and it was not treated properly Tuberculosis (TB) vaccination There is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) called the BCG vaccine. It's recommended for some people who are at higher risk of catching TB or getting seriously ill from it, including: babies who live in areas of the UK where TB is more common babies and children who live with someone who has TB babies and children who were born or lived in a country where TB is more common babies and children whose parents or grandparents were born in a country where TB is more common people aged 35 and under who are spending more than 3 months in a country where TB is more common people at risk of getting TB through their work, such as healthcare workers who work with people who have TB Find out more about the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) Page last reviewed: 20 April 2023 Next review due: 20 April 2026"

    "text": "Temporal arteritis Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) is where the arteries, particularly those at the side of the head (the temples), become inflamed. It's serious and needs urgent treatment. Symptoms of temporal arteritis The symptoms of temporal arteritis depend on which arteries are affected. The main symptoms are: frequent, severe headaches pain or tenderness at the side of your head (temples) or on the scalp jaw pain while eating or talking vision problems, such as double vision or loss of vision in 1 or both eyes More general symptoms are also common – for example, flu-like symptoms, unintentional weight loss, depression and tiredness. Some people with temporal arteritis also develop polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) . This causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you think you might have temporal arteritis It can lead to serious problems like stroke and blindness if not treated quickly. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Tests for temporal arteritis If you see a GP about temporal arteritis, they’ll ask about your symptoms and examine your temples. After having some blood tests, you'll be referred to a specialist. They may carry out further tests to help diagnose temporal arteritis. You may have: an ultrasound scan of your temples a biopsy under local anaesthetic – where a small piece of the temporal artery is removed and checked for signs of temporal arteritis If you have problems with your vision, you should have a same-day appointment with an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) at a hospital eye department. Treatment for temporal arteritis Temporal arteritis is treated with steroid medicine , usually prednisolone . Treatment will be started before temporal arteritis is confirmed because of the risk of vision loss if it's not dealt with quickly. There are 2 stages of treatment: An initial high dose of steroids for a few weeks to help bring your symptoms under control. A lower steroid dose (after your symptoms have improved) given over a longer period of time, possibly several years. A small number of people may need to take steroids for the rest of their life. You'll have regular follow-ups to see how you're doing and check for any side effects you may have. Important: Steroids Do not suddenly stop taking steroids unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine could make you very ill. Other treatments You may also need to take other types of medicine if you have temporal arteritis, including: : low-dose aspirin – to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack, which can happen if the arteries to your heart are affected proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – to lower your risk of getting a stomach problem like indigestion or a stomach ulcer , which can be a side effect of taking prednisolone bisphosphonate therapy – to reduce the risk of osteoporosis when taking prednisolone immunosuppressants – to allow steroid medicine to be reduced and help prevent temporal arteritis coming back Page last reviewed: 14 August 2023 Next review due: 14 August 2026"

It's rare in the UK because the tetanus vaccine has been part of the routine vaccination schedule for many years. Check if you're at risk of tetanus There is a risk of tetanus if soil or manure containing bacteria gets into a wound, such as a bite, burn or scratch. Tetanus is rare, but the chances of getting it are higher if: you have not been fully vaccinated (the tetanus vaccine has routinely been given since 1961) you have a large or deep wound the wound is very dirty or there is something stuck in the wound Check with your GP surgery if you’re not sure you’ve been fully vaccinated against tetanus. Symptoms of tetanus The symptoms of tetanus usually start around 4 to 21 days after infection. Most people get symptoms after about 10 days. The symptoms of tetanus include: a stiff jaw (lockjaw), which can make opening your mouth difficult painful muscle spasms, often in your back, tummy, arms, legs, hands and feet difficulty breathing swallowing problems a high temperature sweating a fast heartbeat fits (seizures) Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You have a wound, such as a bite, burn or scratch and: you've not been fully vaccinated against tetanus (or you’re not sure if you have) you've tried to clean the wound but there's still dirt or soil in it the wound is hot or swollen (it may also be painful, red or darker than the surrounding skin) you have a high temperature, or you feel hot and shivery You can call 111 or get help from 111 online .

    "title": "Overview-Thalassaemia",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thalassaemia/",
    "text": "Overview - Thalassaemia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Thalassaemia carriers Thalassaemia is the name for a group of inherited conditions that affect a substance in the blood called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is used by red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. In people with thalassaemia, some of their haemoglobin does not work properly. This can make them very anaemic (tired, short of breath and pale). It mainly affects people of Mediterranean, south Asian, southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin. There are different types of thalassaemia, which can be divided into alpha and beta thalassaemias. Beta thalassaemia major is the most severe type. Other types include beta thalassaemia intermedia, alpha thalassaemia major and haemoglobin H disease. It's also possible to be a \"carrier\" of thalassaemia, also known as having the thalassaemia trait. Being a beta thalassaemia carrier will not generally cause you any health problems, but you're at risk of having children with thalassaemia. Symptoms of thalassaemia Most people born with thalassaemia experience health problems from a few months after birth. Less severe cases may not be noticeable until later in childhood or even until adulthood. The main health conditions associated with thalassaemia are: anaemia – severe tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath , pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeats ( palpitations ) and pale skin caused by the lack of haemoglobin too much iron in the body – this is caused by the regular blood transfusions used to treat anaemia and can cause problems with the heart, liver and hormone levels if untreated Some people may also have delayed growth, weak and fragile bones ( osteoporosis ), and reduced fertility . Causes of thalassaemia Thalassaemia is caused by faulty genes that affect the production of haemoglobin. A child can only be born with thalassaemia if they inherit these faulty genes from both parents. For example, if both parents have the faulty gene that causes beta thalassaemia major, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have being born with the condition. The parents of a child with thalassaemia are usually carriers. This means they only have 1 of the faulty genes. Screening and testing for thalassaemia Thalassaemia is often detected during pregnancy or soon after birth. Screening for thalassaemia in pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women in England to check if there's a risk of a child being born with the condition, and some types may be picked up during the newborn blood spot test (heel prick test). Blood tests can also be carried out at any age to check for thalassaemia or to see if you're a carrier of a faulty gene that causes it. Treatments for thalassaemia People with thalassaemia major or other serious types will need specialist care throughout their lives. The main treatments are: blood transfusions – regular blood transfusions treat and prevent anaemia; in severe cases these are needed around once a month chelation therapy – treatment with medicine to remove the excess iron from the body that builds up as a result of having regular blood transfusions; some people with thalassaemia get a build-up of iron even without transfusions and need treatment for this Eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and not smoking or drinking too much alcohol can also help you stay as healthy as possible. The only possible cure for thalassaemia is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant , but this is not done very often because of the risks involved. Outlook for thalassaemia Although the main health problems associated with thalassaemia can often be managed with treatment, it's still a serious health condition that can have a significant impact on a person's life. Even in mild cases, there's still a risk you could pass on a more serious type to your children. Without close monitoring and regular treatment, the most severe types can cause serious organ damage and be life threatening. In the past, severe thalassaemia was often fatal by early adulthood. But with current treatments, people are likely to live into their 50s, 60s and beyond. Carriers of thalassaemia (having the thalassaemia trait) A carrier of thalassaemia is someone who carries at least 1 of the faulty genes that causes thalassaemia, but does not have thalassaemia themselves. It's also known as having the thalassaemia trait. If you're a thalassaemia carrier, you will not develop thalassaemia. Being a carrier will not generally cause you any health problems. But you may get mild anaemia because your red blood cells are smaller than usual and your haemoglobin level may be slightly lower than normal. This is not the same as iron deficiency anaemia and does not need any treatment. If you're a thalassaemia carrier, you're at risk of having a child with thalassaemia if your partner is also a carrier. You can request a blood test to check if you're a carrier of thalassaemia from your GP surgery. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) If you or your child has thalassaemia, your healthcare team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat thalassaemia. You can opt out of the register at any time. UK Thalassaemia Society Finding out as much as possible about thalassaemia may help you feel more in control of your condition. The UK Thalassaemia Society (UKTS) is the main UK charity for people with thalassaemia. Its website contains a wide range of useful information, including news about research into the condition.

    "title": "The 'male menopause'",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/male-menopause/",
    "text": "The 'male menopause' Some men develop depression, loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and other physical and emotional symptoms when they reach their late 40s to early 50s. Other symptoms common in men this age are: mood swings and irritability loss of muscle mass and reduced ability to exercise fat redistribution, such as developing a large belly or \"man boobs\" ( gynaecomastia ) a general lack of enthusiasm or energy difficulty sleeping ( insomnia ) or increased tiredness poor concentration and short-term memory These symptoms can interfere with everyday life and happiness, so it's important to find the underlying cause and work out what can be done to resolve it. Is there such a thing as a \"male menopause\"? The \"male menopause\" (sometimes called the andropause) is an unhelpful term sometimes used in the media. This label is misleading because it suggests the symptoms are the result of a sudden drop in testosterone in middle age, similar to what occurs in the female menopause . This is not true. Although testosterone levels fall as men age, the decline is steady at about 1% a year from around the age of 30 to 40, and this is unlikely to cause any problems in itself. A testosterone deficiency that develops later in life, also known as late-onset hypogonadism, can sometimes be responsible for these symptoms, but in many cases the symptoms are nothing to do with hormones. Personal or lifestyle issues Lifestyle factors or psychological problems can also be responsible for many of these symptoms. For example, erectile dysfunction , low sex drive and mood swings may be the result of: stress depression anxiety There are also physical causes of erectile dysfunction, such as smoking or heart problems, which may happen alongside any psychological cause. Psychological problems are typically brought on by work or relationship issues, money problems or worrying about ageing parents. A \"midlife crisis\" can also be responsible. This can happen when men think they have reached life's halfway stage. Anxieties over what they have accomplished so far, either in their job or personal life, can lead to a period of depression. Other possible causes of the \"male menopause\" include: lack of sleep a poor diet lack of exercise drinking too much alcohol smoking low self-esteem Late-onset hypogonadism In some cases, where lifestyle or psychological problems do not seem to be responsible, the symptoms of the \"male menopause\" may be the result of hypogonadism, where the testes produce few or no hormones. Hypogonadism is sometimes present from birth, which can cause symptoms like delayed puberty and small testes. Hypogonadism can also occasionally develop later in life, particularly in men who are obese or have type 2 diabetes . This is known as late-onset hypogonadism and can cause the \"male menopause\" symptoms. But this is an uncommon and specific medical condition that's not a normal part of ageing. A diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism can usually be made based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests used to measure your testosterone levels. What to do If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, see your GP. They'll ask about your work and personal life to see if your symptoms may be caused by a mental health issue, such as stress or anxiety. If stress or anxiety are affecting you, you may benefit from medication or a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . Exercise and relaxation can also help. Read about: stress management treating anxiety help for low mood and depression exercise for depression breathing exercises for stress Do I need hormone replacement therapy (HRT)? Your GP may also order a blood test to measure your testosterone levels. If the results suggest you have a testosterone deficiency, you may be referred to an endocrinologist, a specialist in hormone problems. If the specialist confirms this diagnosis, you may be offered testosterone replacement to correct the hormone deficiency, which should relieve your symptoms. This treatment may be given as an injection or a gel. Page last reviewed: 13 October 2022 Next review due: 13 October 2025"

Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you have sudden breathlessness, sharp chest pain (this may be worse when you breathe in) and a cough or coughing up blood What happens at your appointment If you have symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome, a GP will usually check your arms, chest and neck to look for possible causes of your symptoms. They may refer you for an X-ray or other tests, such as a CT scan or MRI scan. Treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome Thoracic outlet syndrome is usually treated with: physiotherapy – a physiotherapist can teach you some stretching and strengthening exercises that reduce pressure on nerves and blood vessels medicines – you may need medicines to help treat pain, relax muscles, improve circulation and reduce your risk of blood clots Surgery may sometimes be recommended if you're having serious problems (such as blood clots) and other treatments have not worked. For example, if thoracic outlet syndrome is caused by having an extra rib (cervical rib), surgery to remove it may be recommended. Causes of thoracic outlet syndrome Thoracic outlet syndrome can happen if the nerves or blood vessels running along the top of the rib cage (an area called the thoracic outlet) become squashed. Things that can lead to thoracic outlet syndrome include: being born with an extra rib – this is known as a cervical rib poor posture having large breasts an injury to the chest, neck or ribs (such as a car accident) jobs or activities that involve lots of repetitive arm movements (for example if you're a builder or do lots of swimming) gaining a lot of muscle (for example, if you're a body builder) Page last reviewed: 14 December 2023 Next review due: 14 December 2026"

    "text": "Threadworms Threadworms (pinworms) are tiny worms in your poo. They're common in children and spread easily. You can treat them without seeing a GP. Signs of threadworms You can spot threadworms in your poo. They look like pieces of white thread. You might also see them around your child's bottom (anus). The worms usually come out at night while your child is sleeping. See what threadworms look like in poo Credit: Vaio1488 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en Other symptoms can include: extreme itching around the anus or vagina, particularly at night irritability and waking up during the night Less common signs of worms include: weight loss wetting the bed irritated skin around the anus Non-urgent advice: See a pharmacist if: you think you or your child have threadworms Find a pharmacy Treatment for threadworms from a pharmacy You can buy a medicine called mebendazole for threadworms from pharmacies. This is usually a chewable tablet or liquid you swallow. Treat everyone over 2 years old in your household, even if they do not have symptoms. Tell the pharmacist if you need to treat a child under 2 years old, or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Treatment might not be suitable and you may need to speak to a GP. If you cannot take medicine you can treat threadworms by using hygiene methods for 6 weeks. Things you should do at home for threadworms Medicine kills the threadworms, but it does not kill the eggs. Eggs can live for up to 2 weeks outside the body. There are things you can do to stop becoming infected again. Do these for 2 weeks if you’re taking medicine, or for 6 weeks if you’re not taking medicine. Do wash hands and scrub under fingernails – particularly before eating, after using the toilet or changing nappies encourage children to wash hands regularly shower every morning rinse toothbrushes before using them keep fingernails short wash sleepwear, sheets, towels and soft toys (at a hot temperature) every day for several days after treatment disinfect kitchen and bathroom surfaces, using hot water vacuum and dust with a damp cloth make sure everyone in the household wears underwear at night and changes it in the morning Don’t do not shake clothing or bedding, to prevent eggs landing on other surfaces do not share towels or flannels do not bite nails or suck thumbs and fingers Important: Nursery, school and work If you or your child has threadworms there's no need to stay off nursery, school or work. How threadworms spread Threadworms spread when their eggs are swallowed. They lay eggs around your bottom (anus), which make it itchy. The eggs get stuck on your fingers when you scratch. They can then pass on to anything you touch, including: clothes toys toothbrushes kitchen or bathroom surfaces bedding food Eggs can pass to other people when they touch these surfaces and then touch their mouth. The eggs can survive up to 2 weeks. The larvae hatch from the eggs in your gut after you swallow them, and take 1 to 2 months to mature into threadworms. Children can get threadworms again after they've been treated for them if they get the eggs in their mouth. This is why it's important to encourage children to wash their hands regularly.

    "text": "Thrombophilia Thrombophilia is a condition where your blood clots more easily. It can usually be treated with medicines that help prevent blood clots. Symptoms of thrombophilia Most people do not realise they have thrombophilia until it causes a blood clot. Symptoms of a blood clot can include: throbbing pain and swelling in your legs and arms ( deep vein thrombosis ) sudden breathing difficulties, chest pain and coughing up blood ( pulmonary embolism ) Having repeated miscarriages can also be a symptom of thrombophilia. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you: have throbbing or cramping pain in 1 leg, usually in the calf or thigh get swelling in 1 leg have red, darkened or warm skin on your leg suddenly have difficulty breathing are coughing up blood These could be the symptoms of a blood clot in your leg or your lungs. You may get pain and swelling in your arm or tummy instead if that's where the blood clot is. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have severe difficulty breathing you feel pain in your chest or upper back your heart is beating very fast someone has passed out These could be signs of a pulmonary embolism or another serious condition. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Types of thrombophilia There are 2 types of thrombophilia, which have different causes. The 2 main types of thrombophilia Type Why it happens Inherited thrombophilia You’re born with certain altered genes that increase your risks of blood clots Acquired thrombophilia You get an increased risk of clots in later life due to another condition, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or a problem with your liver or kidneys If you have inherited thrombophilia, there is a chance you could pass the condition to any children you have. Your doctor can tell you more. Diagnosing thrombophilia You may be offered a blood test for thrombophilia if: you had a blood clot and it’s not obvious why you had it (for example, you’re not overweight and do not smoke) a close family member (parent, brother or sister) has inherited thrombophilia you’ve had 3 or more miscarriages Blood tests can check for altered genes or changes in your blood cells linked to thrombophilia. You may be offered ultrasound scans or CT scans to see if there are any problems with your blood vessels. Treatment for thrombophilia There is currently no cure for thrombophilia that’s caused by altered genes you inherit from your parents (inherited thrombophilia). Thrombophilia that starts later in life (acquired thrombophilia) can sometimes get better if the underlying cause is treated. If your doctor thinks your overall risk of a blood clot is low, you may not need any treatment. If you need treatment, you’ll usually be offered anticoagulant medicine . It works by making your blood less sticky so it’s less likely to clot. Things you can do if you have thrombophilia For many people, thrombophilia does not have a big impact on their life. But there are things you can do to reduce the risk of getting blood clots. Do stay active try to lose weight if you're overweight drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration – you're more likely to get a clot if you're dehydrated wear flight stockings or flight socks to improve your blood flow on long flights – a pharmacist can advise you about this Don’t do not smoke do not drink lots of alcohol – this can make you dehydrated do not sit for long periods without moving, if you can avoid it Important Tell your doctor or healthcare professional that you have thrombophilia before having any medical procedures or starting any new prescription medicines (including contraception). Some medicines may not be safe for you, and you may need extra treatment or monitoring when you have medical procedures. Thrombophilia and pregnancy If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should contact your GP if you have thrombophilia. You may need additional treatment and monitoring to reduce complications. Page last reviewed: 08 January 2025 Next review due: 08 January 2028"

    "text": "Overview - Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or \"mini stroke\" is caused by a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain. The disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can cause sudden symptoms similar to a stroke , such as speech and visual disturbance, and numbness or weakness in the face, arms and legs. But a TIA does not last as long as a stroke. The effects last a few minutes to a few hours and fully resolve within 24 hours. Symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) The main symptoms of a TIA can be remembered with the word FAST: Face – the face may have dropped on 1 side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped. Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them raised because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm. Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all, despite appearing to be awake; they may also have problems understanding what you're saying to them. Time – it's time to call 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms. When to get medical advice In the early stages of a TIA, it's not possible to tell whether you're having a TIA or a full stroke. It's important to call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone else has symptoms of a TIA or stroke. Even if the symptoms disappear while you're waiting for an ambulance to arrive, you still need to be assessed in hospital. You should be referred to see a specialist within 24 hours of the onset of your symptoms. A TIA is a warning sign that you may be at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors determine the best way to reduce the chances of that happening. If you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have passed and you did not seek medical advice at the time, make an urgent appointment with a GP. They can determine whether to refer you for a hospital assessment. Causes of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) During a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), 1 of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. This blockage is usually caused by a blood clot that's formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain, although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty material or air bubbles. Certain things can increase your chances of having a TIA, including: smoking high blood pressure (hypertension) obesity high cholesterol levels regularly drinking an excessive amount of alcohol having a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation having diabetes People over 55 years of age and people of Asian, African or Caribbean descent are also at a higher risk of having a TIA. Treating a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) Although the symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) resolve in a few minutes or hours, you'll need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full stroke happening in the future. Treatment will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age and medical history. You're likely to be given advice about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk, and be offered medicine to treat the cause of the TIA. In some cases, a surgery called a carotid endarterectomy may be needed to unblock your carotid arteries, which are the main blood vessels that supply your brain with blood. Preventing a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is often a sign that another one may follow and you're at a high risk of having a full, life-threatening stroke in the near future. Regardless of whether you have had a TIA or stroke in the past, there are several ways you can lower your risk of having either in the future. These include: maintaining a healthy weight eating a healthy, balanced diet doing regular exercise limiting alcohol not smoking Video: transient ischaemic attack (TIA) This video explains the causes of TIA, or mini-stroke, and how to spot the symptoms.

Ticks infected with the virus are found in parts of Europe (including the UK) and Asia. In the UK, the risk of getting TBE is very low. Check if you're at risk of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) The risk of getting tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is very low. Ticks that spread it can be found in: most of Europe – including the UK Russia parts of China and Japan Ticks live in woodlands and grassy areas, but they can also be found in some parks and gardens. In the UK, only a very small number of ticks carry the TBE virus. Even if you're bitten by a tick, the risk of getting seriously ill is very low. TBE can also be spread through raw (unpasteurised) milk or dairy foods. Information: You can check the risks of a country you're travelling to on the TravelHealthPro website How to reduce your risk of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in the UK and abroad. Avoiding tick bites To reduce your risk of being bitten by a tick when you're outside: regularly check your clothes and skin for ticks that might be crawling on you and brush them off before they can bite you – wear light coloured clothing so it's easier to spot any ticks walk on clearly defined paths to avoid brushing against plants that may have ticks on them use an insect repellent such as DEET on your skin – you can also get clothes that contain insect repellent wear long trousers and long-sleeved tops so it's harder for ticks to bite you Ticks can sometimes be very small and hard to spot. They get bigger if they bite you and feed on your blood. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/575711/view Removing a tick that has bitten you If you're bitten by a tick, try to remove it as soon as possible. To remove a tick safely: Use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool (you can buy these from some pharmacies, vets and pet shops). Grasp the tick as close to your skin as possible and pull upwards slowly and firmly, as mouthparts left in the skin can cause a skin infection. Take care not to squeeze or crush the tick. Dispose of it when you have removed it. Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water.

You do not need to get medical help unless you become unwell. Important Tick bites are usually painless. You may not notice a tick unless you see it on your skin. Always check your skin and hair after being outdoors. TBE vaccine A vaccine for TBE is recommended if you're visiting a country where the infection is common and you're planning to do outdoor activities when you get there. You need at least 2 injections, given at least 2 weeks apart, to be protected for travel. You should have the first injection at least 1 month before travelling. You'll have to pay for the TBE vaccine. You can get it from travel health clinics and pharmacies with travel health services. Symptoms of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) The virus that causes tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) does not cause symptoms in most people. Some people get flu-like symptoms about a week after being bitten, such as: a high temperature tiredness headache aches and pains feeling sick The symptoms usually go away on their own, but in a few people the infection spreads to the brain and causes more serious symptoms a few days or weeks later. These can include: a stiff neck and a severe headache pain when looking at bright lights a fit (seizure) a change in behaviour, confusion or slurred speech weakness or loss of movement in part of the body Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You've been bitten by a tick or visited an area in the past month where ticks are found, and you get either: flu-like symptoms, such as feeling hot and shivery, headaches, aching muscles or feeling sick a circular rash (this could be a different infection spread by ticks called Lyme disease ) You can call 111 or get help from 111 online .

    "title": "Overview-Tics",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tics/",
    "text": "Overview - Tics Contents Overview Treatment Tics are fast, repetitive muscle movements that result in sudden and difficult to control body jolts or sounds. They're fairly common in childhood and typically first appear at around 5 years of age. Very occasionally they can start in adulthood. Tics are not usually serious and normally improve over time. But they can be frustrating and interfere with everyday activities. Tourette's syndrome , a term that's used when tics have lasted for more than a year, is covered separately. Types of tics There are many types of tic. Some affect body movement (motor tics) and others result in a sound (vocal or phonic tics). Examples of tics include: blinking, wrinkling the nose or grimacing jerking or banging the head clicking the fingers touching other people or things coughing, grunting or sniffing repeating a sound or phrase – in a small number of cases, this may be something obscene or offensive Tics can happen randomly and they may be associated with something such as stress , anxiety , tiredness , excitement or happiness. They tend to get worse if they're talked about or focused on. They often start with an unpleasant sensation that builds up in the body until relieved by the tic – known as an urge – although they can sometimes be partly suppressed. When to see a GP Tics are not usually serious and they do not damage the brain. You do not always need to see a GP if they're mild and not causing problems. Sometimes they can disappear as quickly as they appear. See a GP if you're concerned about your or your child's tics, you need support or advice, or the tics: occur very regularly, or become more frequent or severe cause emotional or social problems, such as embarrassment, bullying or social isolation cause pain or discomfort (some tics can cause the person to accidentally hurt themselves) interfere with daily activities, school or work are accompanied by anger, depression or self harm A GP should be able to diagnose a tic from a description of it and, if possible, seeing it. Recording a short video can be helpful, but be careful not to draw too much attention to the tic while filming as this can make it worse. Treatments for tics Treatment is not always needed if a tic is mild and is not causing any other problems. Self-help tips, such as avoiding stress or tiredness, are often very helpful for the majority of people. If a tic is more severe and is affecting everyday activities, therapies that aim to reduce how often tics occur may be recommended. The main therapies for tics are: Habit reversal therapy – this aims to help you or your child learn intentional movements that \"compete\" with tics, so the tic cannot happen at the same time Comprehensive behavioural intervention for tics (CBiT) – a set of behavioural techniques to help learn skills to reduce tics Exposure with response prevention (ERP) – this aims to help you or your child get used to the unpleasant sensations that are often felt just before a tic, which can stop the tic occurring There are also medicines that can help reduce tics. These may be used alongside psychological therapies or after trying these therapies unsuccessfully. Read more about how tics are treated . How long do tics last? In most cases, tics improve over time or stop completely. Sometimes they may just last a few months, but often they come and go over several years. They are normally most severe from around 8 years of age until teenage years, and usually start to improve after puberty. Causes of tics It's not clear what causes tics. They're thought to be due to changes in the parts of the brain that control movement. They can run in families, and there's likely to be a genetic cause in many cases. They also often happen alongside other conditions, such as: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) Tics can sometimes be triggered by taking illegal drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, and are occasionally caused by more serious health conditions such as cerebral palsy or Huntington's disease .

    "text": "Tight foreskin (phimosis) It's normal for babies and young boys to have a tight foreskin (phimosis), but adults can also be affected. See a GP if your or your child's foreskin is sore or swollen. Symptoms of a tight foreskin The foreskin is the thin layer of skin that covers the end of the penis. If you or your child has a tight foreskin, it will be difficult to pull it back from the end of the penis. A tight foreskin is normal in babies and young boys. Most boys' foreskins do not pull back (retract) before the age of 5, but sometimes it's not possible until they're 10 or older. The end of a boy's penis may bulge or balloon when they pee, particularly if their foreskin is tight. A tight foreskin is not usually a problem, unless there are symptoms such as: swelling and tenderness pain when peeing or a weak flow of pee blood in urine frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) bleeding or a thick discharge from under the foreskin or an unpleasant smell – these are signs of an infection ( balanitis ) painful erections, which can make having sex difficult Things you can do if you have a tight foreskin If your or your child's foreskin is tight, but is not causing problems like pain or bleeding, there are some things you can do to help ease it and keep the penis clean. Do wash your penis regularly – use warm water or warm water and non-perfumed soap gently pull back your foreskin as far as you can, so you can clean underneath it (adults only) Don’t do not pull back the foreskin of a baby or young boy because it could be painful and damage it, leading to problems in later life do not use perfumed soap, talcum powder or deodorants on your penis because they may cause irritation Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your or your child's foreskin is tight and swollen or painful there's bleeding around your or your child's foreskin when peeing, a thick discharge from under the foreskin, or an unpleasant smell Treatments for a tight foreskin The foreskins of babies and young boys will usually loosen as they get older, so treatment is often not needed. If your or your child's foreskin is causing problems, treatments include: steroid creams or gels ( topical steroids ) to help soften the foreskin antibiotics if the foreskin or head of the penis is infected surgery – removal of the foreskin (circumcision) or a procedure where small cuts are made in the tip of the foreskin so it can be pulled back more easily (usually only suitable for children) Information: Find out more Circumcision in boys Circumcision in men British Association of Urological Surgeons: phimosis and phimosis treatments Complications of a tight foreskin Sometimes if the foreskin is very tight it can get stuck and cannot go back to its original position covering the end of the penis. The end of the penis can then become very swollen and painful. This is known as paraphimosis and it's a medical emergency. Immediate treatment is needed to avoid serious complications like restricted blood flow to the penis. A doctor may be able to return the foreskin to its original position. Sometimes surgery to remove the foreskin (circumcision) may be recommended. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you or your child's foreskin is pulled back and cannot go back to its original position over the end of the penis Information: Do not drive to A&E.

    "text": "Overview - Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or \"mini stroke\" is caused by a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain. The disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can cause sudden symptoms similar to a stroke , such as speech and visual disturbance, and numbness or weakness in the face, arms and legs. But a TIA does not last as long as a stroke. The effects last a few minutes to a few hours and fully resolve within 24 hours. Symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) The main symptoms of a TIA can be remembered with the word FAST: Face – the face may have dropped on 1 side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped. Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them raised because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm. Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all, despite appearing to be awake; they may also have problems understanding what you're saying to them. Time – it's time to call 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms. When to get medical advice In the early stages of a TIA, it's not possible to tell whether you're having a TIA or a full stroke. It's important to call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone else has symptoms of a TIA or stroke. Even if the symptoms disappear while you're waiting for an ambulance to arrive, you still need to be assessed in hospital. You should be referred to see a specialist within 24 hours of the onset of your symptoms. A TIA is a warning sign that you may be at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors determine the best way to reduce the chances of that happening. If you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have passed and you did not seek medical advice at the time, make an urgent appointment with a GP. They can determine whether to refer you for a hospital assessment. Causes of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) During a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), 1 of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. This blockage is usually caused by a blood clot that's formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain, although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty material or air bubbles. Certain things can increase your chances of having a TIA, including: smoking high blood pressure (hypertension) obesity high cholesterol levels regularly drinking an excessive amount of alcohol having a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation having diabetes People over 55 years of age and people of Asian, African or Caribbean descent are also at a higher risk of having a TIA. Treating a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) Although the symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) resolve in a few minutes or hours, you'll need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full stroke happening in the future. Treatment will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age and medical history. You're likely to be given advice about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk, and be offered medicine to treat the cause of the TIA. In some cases, a surgery called a carotid endarterectomy may be needed to unblock your carotid arteries, which are the main blood vessels that supply your brain with blood. Preventing a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is often a sign that another one may follow and you're at a high risk of having a full, life-threatening stroke in the near future. Regardless of whether you have had a TIA or stroke in the past, there are several ways you can lower your risk of having either in the future. These include: maintaining a healthy weight eating a healthy, balanced diet doing regular exercise limiting alcohol not smoking Video: transient ischaemic attack (TIA) This video explains the causes of TIA, or mini-stroke, and how to spot the symptoms.

    "text": "Overview - Trichomoniasis Contents Overview Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). Symptoms of trichomoniasis Symptoms of trichomoniasis usually develop within a month of infection. But up to half of all people will not develop any symptoms (though they can still pass the infection on to others). The symptoms of trichomoniasis are similar to those of many other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) , so it can sometimes be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms in women Trichomoniasis in women can cause: abnormal vaginal discharge that may be thick, thin or frothy and yellow-green in colour producing more discharge than normal, which may also have an unpleasant fishy smell soreness, swelling and itching around the vagina – sometimes the inner thighs also become itchy pain or discomfort when passing urine or having sex Symptoms in men Trichomoniasis in men can cause: pain when peeing or during ejaculation needing to pee more frequently than usual thin, white discharge from the penis soreness, swelling and redness around the head of the penis or foreskin When to get medical advice See a GP or go to your local sexual health clinic (sometimes called a GUM clinic) if you develop any of the symptoms of trichomoniasis or you think you may be infected. Trichomoniasis can usually be diagnosed after an examination of the genitals and a laboratory test carried out on a swab taken from the vagina or penis. If the test shows you have trichomoniasis, it's important that your current sexual partner and any other recent partners are also tested and treated. How do you get trichomoniasis? Trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. In women, this parasite mainly infects the vagina and the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). In men, the infection most commonly affects the urethra, but the head of the penis or prostate gland – a gland near the bladder that helps produce semen – can become infected in some cases. The parasite is usually spread by having sex without using a condom . It could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you do not wash them or cover them with a new condom before use. You do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. Anyone who's sexually active can catch it and pass it on. Trichomoniasis is not thought to be passed on through oral or anal sex. You also cannot pass on trichomoniasis through: kissing or hugging sharing cups, plates or cutlery toilet seats The best way to prevent trichomoniasis is to have safe sex. This means always using a condom when having sex, covering any sex toys you use with a condom, and washing sex toys after use. Treating trichomoniasis Trichomoniasis is unlikely to go away without treatment, but it can be effectively treated with antibiotics . Most men and women are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is usually taken twice a day for 5 to 7 days. It's important to complete the whole course of antibiotics and avoid having sex until the infection clears up to prevent reinfection. Your current sexual partner and any other recent partners should also be treated. Complications of trichomoniasis Complications of trichomoniasis are rare, although some women with the infection may be at an increased risk of further problems. If you're infected with trichomoniasis while you're pregnant, the infection may cause your baby to be born prematurely or have a low birthweight.

It's often described as a sharp shooting pain or like having an electric shock in the jaw, teeth or gums. It usually happens in short, unpredictable attacks that can last from a few seconds to about 2 minutes. The attacks stop as suddenly as they start. In most cases, trigeminal neuralgia affects just one side of the face, with the pain usually felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally the pain can affect both sides of the face, although not usually at the same time.

In severe cases attacks may happen hundreds of times a day. It's possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (remission), although these periods tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then develop a more continuous aching, throbbing or burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks. Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult. It can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression . Read more about the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia . When to seek medical advice See a GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen , do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes. The GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. However, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed. Read more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia . What causes trigeminal neuralgia? Trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the nerve inside the skull that transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. The compression of the trigeminal nerve is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. Trigeminal neuralgia can also happen when the trigeminal nerve is damaged by another medical condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour. The attacks of pain are usually brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind – even a slight breeze or air conditioning – or movement of the face or head. Sometimes the pain can happen without a trigger. Read more about the causes of trigeminal neuralgia . Who's affected It's not clear how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but it's thought to be rare. Trigeminal neuralgia affects more women than men, and it usually starts between the ages of 50 and 60. It's rare in adults younger than 40. Treating trigeminal neuralgia Trigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, the treatments available do help most cases to some degree. An anticonvulsant medicine called carbamazepine , which is often used to treat epilepsy , is the first treatment usually recommended to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine can relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages. Carbamazepine needs to be taken several times a day to be effective, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so high enough levels of the medicine can build up in your bloodstream. Unless your pain becomes much better, or disappears, the medicine is usually continued for as long as necessary, which could be for many years. If you're entering a period of remission, where your pain goes away, stopping carbamazepine should always be done slowly, over days or weeks, unless a doctor tells you otherwise. If this medicine does not help you, causes too many side effects, or you're unable to take it, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medicines or surgical procedures that may help. There are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years. Alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open your skull and move any blood vessels that are compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results for long-term pain relief, but it's a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as hearing loss , facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke . Read more about treating trigeminal neuralgia . Post-herpetic neuralgia Post-herpetic neuralgia is a more common type of nerve pain that usually develops in an area previously affected by shingles .

    "title": "Overview-Trigger finger",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trigger-finger/",
    "text": "Overview - Trigger finger Contents Overview Causes Treatment Trigger finger is a condition that affects one or more of the hand's tendons, making it difficult to bend the affected finger or thumb. If a tendon or the tunnel a tendon runs through (called the tendon sheath) becomes swollen and inflamed, the tendon gets irritated and can \"catch\" in the tendon sheath. This can make it difficult to move the affected finger or thumb and can result in a clicking sensation. Trigger finger is also known as stenosing tenosynovitis or stenosing tenovaginosis. It can affect the thumb and any finger. One or more fingers can be affected and the problem may develop in both hands. Symptoms of trigger finger Symptoms of trigger finger can include pain at the base of the affected finger or thumb when you move it or press on it, and stiffness or clicking when you move the affected finger or thumb, particularly first thing in the morning. If the condition gets worse, you may have pain in your hand even when it's still. You might also get a lump in your palm and your finger may get stuck in a bent position and then suddenly pop straight. Eventually, it may not fully bend or straighten. See your GP if you think you may have trigger finger. They'll examine your hand and advise you about appropriate treatments. What causes trigger finger? Tendons are tough cords that join bone to muscle. They move the bone when the muscle contracts. In the hand, tendons run along the front and back of the bones in the fingers and are attached to the muscles in the forearm. The tendons on the palm side of the hand (flexor tendons) are held in place by strong bands of tissue, known as ligaments, which are shaped in arches over the tendon. The tendons are covered by a protective sheath which produces a small amount of fluid to keep the tendons lubricated. This allows them to move freely and smoothly within the sheath when the fingers are bent and straightened. Trigger finger occurs if there's a problem with the tendon or sheath, such as inflammation and swelling. If the tendon can no longer slide easily through the sheath it can bunch up to form a small lump (nodule). This makes bending the affected finger or thumb difficult. If the tendon gets caught in the sheath, the finger can click painfully as it's straightened. The exact reason why these problems occur is not known, but several factors may increase the likelihood of trigger finger developing. For example, it's more common in women, people over 40 years old, and those with certain medical conditions. Another hand-related condition called Dupuytren's contracture can also increase your risk of developing trigger finger. In Dupuytren's contracture, the connective tissue in the palm of the hand thickens, causing 1 or more fingers to bend into the palm of the hand. Long-term conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis , are also associated with trigger finger. How trigger finger is treated In some people, trigger finger may get better without treatment. However, if it is not treated, there's a chance the affected finger or thumb could become permanently bent, which will make performing everyday tasks difficult. If treatment is necessary, several options are available, including: rest – avoiding certain activities medication – taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help relieve pain splinting – where the affected finger is strapped to a plastic splint to reduce movement steroid injection – steroids are medicines that can reduce swelling surgery on the affected hand – surgery can allow the affected tendon to move freely again Surgery is usually only used when other treatments have failed. It can be up to 100% effective, although if you do a manual job you may need to take 2 to 4 weeks off work to fully recover. Information: Self-refer for treatment If you have trigger finger, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: ask the receptionist staff at your GP surgery check your GP surgery's website contact your local integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB search online for NHS treatment for trigger finger near you Trigger finger in children Trigger finger is uncommon in children but sometimes young children develop it. It can affect the child's ability to straighten their thumb, but it's rarely painful and usually gets better by age 3 without treatment.

    "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection that usually affects the lungs. It can be treated with antibiotics but can be serious if not treated. There's a vaccine that helps protect some people who are at risk from TB. Symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) Symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) usually come on gradually. Common symptoms include: a cough that lasts more than 3 weeks – you may cough up mucus (phlegm) or mucus with blood in it feeling tired or exhausted a high temperature or night sweats loss of appetite weight loss feeling generally unwell Children may also have difficulty gaining weight or growing. If TB has spread to another part of your body such as your glands (lymph nodes), bones or brain, you may also have other symptoms, including: swollen glands body aches and pains swollen joints or ankles tummy or pelvic pain constipation dark or cloudy pee a headache being sick feeling confused a stiff neck a rash on the legs, face or other part of the body Sometimes you can have TB in your body but have no symptoms. This is called latent TB. If you have TB and you have symptoms, it's called active TB. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you've had a cough for more than 3 weeks you're feeling tired or exhausted and you're not sure why you have a high temperature or night sweats that do not go away you often do not feel hungry you keep losing weight without changing your diet or exercise routine you've spent a lot of time with someone who has tuberculosis (TB) and has symptoms (for example, you live with someone who has it) Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you're coughing up blood or mucus (phlegm) with blood in it You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: you have a stiff neck and a severe headache it's painful to look at bright lights you've had a seizure or fit you've had a change in behaviour – such as sudden confusion you have weakness or loss of movement in part of the body These could be signs that tuberculosis (TB) has spread to your brain (meningitis). Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Tests to check for tuberculosis (TB) If you have symptoms of tuberculosis (TB), tests you may have include: an X-ray, ultrasound, echocardiogram or CT scan of your chest or the part of your body that may be affected taking samples of your mucus (phlegm) a biopsy to take a sample of tissue, cells or fluid from the affected area If you have no symptoms but are at risk from TB (for example, you've been in close contact with someone who has TB) you may have a Mantoux test or blood tests to check if you have it. A Mantoux test is a skin test where a small amount of liquid is injected under the skin in your arm. This liquid will cause a small reaction on your skin if you have TB. Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) The main treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is to take antibiotics for at least 6 months. If TB has spread to your brain, spinal cord or the area around your heart, you may also need to take steroid medicine for a few weeks. If you have TB but do not have symptoms (latent TB) you usually need to take antibiotics for 3 to 6 months . Important It's important to take your antibiotics correctly and until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, TB could come back. Causes of tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria. It can spread through close contact with people who have TB and have symptoms (active TB). When someone with active TB coughs, they release small droplets containing the bacteria. You can catch TB if you regularly breathe in these droplets over a long period of time. Some people have TB in their body but do not get ill or have any symptoms (latent TB). This type of TB cannot be spread to others, but it can turn into active TB in the future. People who are more likely to get TB Anyone can get TB, but some people are more likely to get it or get more seriously ill from it, including people who: spend a lot of time with someone who has active TB, such as people living in the same house were born in or lived in an area where TB is more common have a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV, a kidney transplant or who are having certain treatment like chemotherapy are under 5 years of age live in overcrowded or unhealthy conditions, such as people who are homeless regularly smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs have had TB before and it was not treated properly Tuberculosis (TB) vaccination There is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) called the BCG vaccine. It's recommended for some people who are at higher risk of catching TB or getting seriously ill from it, including: babies who live in areas of the UK where TB is more common babies and children who live with someone who has TB babies and children who were born or lived in a country where TB is more common babies and children whose parents or grandparents were born in a country where TB is more common people aged 35 and under who are spending more than 3 months in a country where TB is more common people at risk of getting TB through their work, such as healthcare workers who work with people who have TB Find out more about the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) Page last reviewed: 20 April 2023 Next review due: 20 April 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Tuberous sclerosis Contents Overview Features Diagnosis Treatment Tuberous sclerosis, also known as tuberous sclerosis complex, is a rare genetic condition that causes mainly non-cancerous (benign) tumours to develop in different parts of the body. The tumours most often affect the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes and lungs. Tuberous sclerosis is present from birth, although it may not cause obvious problems immediately. What problems can tuberous sclerosis cause? The tumours caused by tuberous sclerosis can result in a range of associated health problems, including: epilepsy – a condition that causes seizures (fits) learning disabilities hyperactivity an autistic spectrum disorder skin abnormalities – such as patches of light-coloured or thickened skin, or red acne-like spots on the face the kidneys not working properly breathing difficulties a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus) These problems can range from mild to severe, and it's possible to have only a few of these problems or a wide range. Members of the same family may be affected very differently by tuberous sclerosis. Read more about the features of tuberous sclerosis and diagnosing tuberous sclerosis . What causes tuberous sclerosis? Tuberous sclerosis is caused by changes (mutations) in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. These genes are involved in regulating cell growth, and the mutations lead to uncontrolled growth and multiple tumours throughout the body. In around 3 in every 4 cases, the genetic fault occurs for no apparent reason in people without any other affected family members. In the remaining 1 in 4 cases, the fault is passed on to a child by their parents. Only one parent needs to carry the faulty gene to pass it on, and a parent who has one of the faulty genes has a 1 in 2 chance of passing it on to each child they have. The parent carrying the faulty gene will also have tuberous sclerosis, although sometimes it may be so mild they do not realise. How tuberous sclerosis is treated There is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, but there is a range of treatments for many of the problems caused by the condition. For example: epilepsy may be controlled with medicine or, in some cases, surgery extra educational support can help children with learning disabilities challenging behaviour and psychiatric problems – such as anxiety or depression – can be treated with behavioural interventions and medicine brain tumours can be surgically removed or shrunk with medicine the facial rash can be treated with laser therapy or medication applied to the skin medicine can control symptoms caused by reduced kidney function and can help shrink kidney tumours lung problems can be treated with medication Research has found that a type of medicine known as an mTOR inhibitor, which interrupts the chemical reactions needed for tumours to grow, may be a useful treatment in the future. People with tuberous sclerosis will also need to have regular tests to monitor the function of the organs that can be affected by the condition. Read more about treating tuberous sclerosis . Outlook The outlook for people with tuberous sclerosis can vary considerably. Some people have few symptoms and the condition has little effect on their life, while others – particularly those with a faulty TSC2 gene or obvious problems from an early age – can have severe and potentially life-threatening problems that require lifelong care. Many people will have a normal lifespan, although a number of life-threatening complications can develop. These include a loss of kidney function, a serious lung infection called bronchopneumonia and a severe type of epileptic seizure called status epilepticus. People with tuberous sclerosis may also have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as kidney cancer , but this is rare. Tuberous Sclerosis Association (TSA) The TSA provides information, advice and support to individuals and families affected by tuberous sclerosis.

There is currently no cure but treatment and support is available to help manage any symptoms. Symptoms of Turner syndrome There are lots of possible symptoms of Turner syndrome. Everyone with the condition is affected differently, but almost everyone will: be born smaller than usual and grow up to be shorter than average have underdeveloped ovaries, which can affect puberty and cause infertility There are also a wide range of other physical features, characteristics and health problems that may affect people with Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome does not usually affect intelligence or language and reading skills, but it may cause some types of learning difficulties. Information: Find out more Turner Syndrome Support Society: what is Turner Syndrome? Diagnosing Turner syndrome Turner syndrome may be diagnosed in babies and children: at birth or during childhood when the typical features or symptoms of the condition are noticed – a blood test can confirm the diagnosis during pregnancy if problems with the heart or kidneys are found during routine ultrasound scans If you're pregnant and your maternity team think your baby could have Turner syndrome, you may be offered tests to check for the condition. This could be either: chorionic villus sampling (CVS) amniocentesis Causes of Turner syndrome Turner syndrome is a genetic condition, caused by a missing or partially missing sex chromosome. It's not possible to prevent Turner syndrome. Very rarely it can be passed to a child by a parent, but most of the time it happens by chance. It is not linked to age or anything the parents did before or during pregnancy. How Turner syndrome affects your life Turner syndrome can slightly reduce how long someone is expected to live, but most people should be able to live a relatively normal, healthy life. It's important to have regular health checks and early treatment for health problems. For example, you or your child may have regular tests to check your blood pressure, bone density and how well your thyroid gland is working. Some people with Turner syndrome experience problems at school, home or work if they have learning difficulties, or during puberty. This can lead to low self-esteem or depression .

Without prompt treatment, it can cause serious complications and can be fatal. It's caused by a bacterium called Salmonella typhi, which is related to the bacteria that cause salmonella food poisoning . Typhoid fever is highly contagious. An infected person can pass the bacteria out of their body in their poo or, less commonly, in their pee. If someone else eats food or drinks water that's been contaminated with a small amount of infected poo or pee, they can become infected with the bacteria and develop typhoid fever. Read more about the causes of typhoid fever . Who's affected? Typhoid fever is most common in parts of the world that have poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Worldwide, children are thought to be most at risk of developing typhoid fever. This may be because their immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) is still developing. But children with typhoid fever tend to have milder symptoms than adults. Typhoid fever is uncommon in the UK, with around 300 infections confirmed each year. Most of these people became infected while visiting relatives in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan. But you're also at risk if you visit Asia, Africa or South America. Symptoms of typhoid fever The main symptoms of typhoid fever are: a persistent high temperature that gradually increases each day headache general aches and pains extreme tiredness (fatigue) cough constipation As the infection progresses, you may lose your appetite, feel sick, and have a tummy ache and diarrhoea . Some people may develop a rash. If typhoid fever isn't treated, the symptoms will continue to get worse over the following weeks and the risk of developing potentially fatal complications will increase. Read more about the symptoms of typhoid fever and the complications of typhoid fever . How typhoid fever is treated Typhoid fever requires prompt treatment with antibiotics . If typhoid fever is diagnosed early, the infection is likely to be mild and can usually be treated at home with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotic tablets. More severe typhoid fever usually requires admission to hospital so antibiotic injections can be given. With prompt antibiotic treatment, most people will start to feel better within a few days and serious complications are very rare. Deaths from typhoid fever are now virtually unheard of in the UK. If typhoid fever isn't treated, it's estimated that up to 1 in 5 people with the condition will die. Some of those who survive will have complications caused by the infection. Read more about treating typhoid fever . Typhoid fever vaccination In the UK, 2 vaccines are available that can provide some protection against typhoid fever. These involve either having a single injection or taking 3 capsules over alternate days. Vaccination is recommended for anyone planning to travel to parts of the world where typhoid fever is widespread. The areas with the highest rates of typhoid fever are: the Indian subcontinent Africa south and southeast Asia South America It’s important to get vaccinated against typhoid fever if you’re travelling to a high risk area because some strains of the typhoid bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics. Vaccination is particularly important if you're planning to live or work closely with local people. But as neither vaccine offers 100% protection, it's also important to follow some precautions when travelling. For example, you should only drink bottled or boiled water, and you should avoid foods that could potentially be contaminated. Read more about the typhoid fever vaccination .

    "text": "Typhus Typhus is an infection spread by lice, fleas or mites. It's very rare in the UK. It can be serious, but most people make a full recovery if treated quickly. How you get typhus You can catch typhus if you're bitten by infected lice, mites or fleas. These are often found on small animals like mice, rats, cats, dogs, and squirrels. People can also carry them on their clothes, skin or hair. Typhus is mainly found in parts of Africa, South America and Asia, especially in places where: hygiene is poor there are overcrowded living conditions there are lots of bushes and grassland How to lower your risk of getting typhus when travelling There's no vaccine to prevent typhus, but you can reduce the risk of getting infected. Do use insect repellent that contains DEET wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers wash and shower regularly wash and change your clothes regularly Don’t do not wear clothing or use bedding that might be infected with body lice Symptoms of typhus Symptoms of typhus include: a high temperature headache a rash, which may be harder to see on black or brown skin feeling sick or being sick feeling generally unwell Non-urgent advice: Get medical advice if: You have symptoms of typhus and: you've recently returned from abroad you're travelling abroad If you're in England, see a GP, call 111 or get help from 111 online . If you're abroad, check your travel insurance for how to get medical help while you're away, or check the health advice for the country you're visiting on GOV.UK . It's important to get diagnosed early so treatment can be started as soon as possible. If typhus is not treated quickly, it can sometimes be life-threatening. Treatment for typhus If a doctor thinks you could have typhus, they'll usually suggest a blood test or skin biopsy . Antibiotics are used to treat a typhus infection. They're usually started before you get your test result, as this can take up to a week. Most people start to feel better within 48 hours of starting treatment. It's important to keep taking your antibiotics until they're finished, even if you feel better. People with severe typhus may need to be treated in hospital.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ulcerative-colitis/",
    "text": "Overview - Ulcerative colitis Contents Overview Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with Complications Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition where the colon and rectum become inflamed. The colon is the large intestine (bowel) and the rectum is the end of the bowel where poo is stored. Small ulcers can develop on the colon's lining, and can bleed and produce pus. Symptoms of ulcerative colitis The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are: recurring diarrhoea , which may contain blood, mucus or pus tummy pain needing to poo frequently You may also experience extreme tiredness (fatigue), loss of appetite and weight loss. The severity of the symptoms varies, depending on how much of the rectum and colon is inflamed and how severe the inflammation is. For some people, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday lives. Symptoms of a flare-up Some people may go for weeks or months with very mild symptoms, or none at all (remission), followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome (flare-ups or relapses). During a flare-up, some people with ulcerative colitis also experience symptoms elsewhere in their body; which are known as extra-intestinal symptoms. These can include: painful and swollen joints (arthritis) mouth ulcers swollen fat under the skin causing bumps and patches – this is known as erythema nodosum irritated and red eyes problems with bones, such as osteoporosis In many people, no specific trigger for flare-ups is identified, although a gut infection can occasionally be the cause. Stress is also thought to be a potential factor. When to get medical advice You should see a GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of ulcerative colitis and you have not been diagnosed with the condition. They can arrange blood or poo sample tests to help determine what may be causing your symptoms. If necessary, they can refer you to hospital for further tests. Find out more about diagnosing ulcerative colitis If you have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and think you may be having a severe flare-up, contact a GP or your care team for advice. You may need to be urgently admitted to hospital for immediate care. If you cannot contact your GP or care team, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service . What causes ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis is thought to be an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, the body's defence against infection, goes wrong and attacks healthy tissue. The most popular theory is that the immune system mistakes harmless bacteria inside the colon as a threat and attacks the tissues of the colon, causing it to become inflamed. Exactly what causes the immune system to behave in this way is unclear. Many experts think it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Who's affected The UK Crohn's & Colitis UK charity reports at least 1 in every 227 people in the UK has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. This amounts to around 296,000 people. The condition can develop at any age, but is most often diagnosed in people between 15 and 25 years old. It's more common in white people of European descent, especially those descended from Ashkenazi Jewish communities, and black people. The condition is rarer in people from Asian backgrounds, although the reasons for this are unclear. Both men and women seem to be equally affected by ulcerative colitis. How ulcerative colitis is treated Treatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve symptoms during a flare-up and prevent symptoms from returning (maintaining remission). In most people, this is achieved by taking medicine, such as: aminosalicylates (ASAs) corticosteroids (steroid medicines) immunosuppressants Mild to moderate flare-ups can usually be treated at home. But more severe flare-ups need to be treated in hospital. If medicines are not effective at controlling your symptoms or your quality of life is significantly affected by your condition, surgery to remove some or all of your bowel (colon) may be an option. During surgery, your small intestine can be diverted out of an opening in your abdomen known as a stoma. This type of surgery is known as an ileostomy. In some cases, the stoma is only temporary and can be closed up once your bowel has healed. An alternative option is to create an internal pouch that's connected to your anus called an ileoanal pouch. Read more about treating ulcerative colitis Complications of ulcerative colitis Complications of ulcerative colitis include: an increased risk of developing bowel cancer poor growth and development in children and young people Also, the steroid medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis can cause weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) as a side effect. Read more about the complications of ulcerative colitis IBD or IBS? Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term mainly used to describe 2 conditions that cause inflammation of the gut (gastrointestinal tract). They are: ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease IBD should not be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , which is a different condition and requires different treatment.

    "title": "Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/underactive-thyroid-hypothyroidism/",
    "text": "Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is a common condition where the thyroid gland in your neck does not make enough hormones. This can cause symptoms like tiredness and weight gain. It can be managed with treatment. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid Symptoms of an underactive thyroid may be mild and may not be easy to notice. Common symptoms include: feeling extremely tired (fatigue) feeling cold more than usual putting on weight constipation difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly low mood or depression dry skin, dry hair or hair loss a croaky (hoarse) voice irregular or heavy periods if you have them Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have an underactive thyroid Some of the symptoms are common and can be caused by other conditions. But it's important to get them checked by a GP. How an underactive thyroid is diagnosed If a GP thinks you might have an underactive thyroid, they'll ask about your symptoms. They'll also ask if someone else in your family has had a thyroid condition or an autoimmune condition, or if you've recently been pregnant. The GP may examine your neck to find out if your thyroid gland is swollen. You may have blood tests to check how much thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) is in your blood. The GP may also refer you to a specialist for more tests. Information: Find out more British Thyroid Foundation: Thyroid function tests Thyroid UK: Getting a diagnosis Treatment for an underactive thyroid An underactive thyroid is usually treated with medicine to replace the thyroid hormone that your body cannot produce. This medicine is usually levothyroxine tablets. You'll usually need to take them for the rest of your life to prevent your symptoms returning. You should be able to live a normal life. Important You'll have regular blood tests to check you're on the right dose of levothyroxine. Being on the wrong dose can cause side effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, headaches or problems sleeping. If you have any side effects, talk to your GP or a pharmacist. Causes of an underactive thyroid In the UK, the main cause of an underactive thyroid is an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto's disease. If you have Hashimoto's disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland meaning it cannot make enough thyroid hormone. Hashimoto's disease is most common in women, and usually starts between the ages of 30 and 50. But anyone can get an underactive thyroid. An underactive thyroid can also be caused by: having another thyroid condition, such as thyroiditis surgery or radiotherapy around your neck or thyroid treatment for an overactive thyroid not getting enough iodine in your diet – this is rare in the UK treatment with certain medicines You're also more likely to have an underactive thyroid if others in your family have had a thyroid condition. Risks of an underactive thyroid An underactive thyroid is not usually serious if you're having the right treatment. If your underactive thyroid is not treated, or you're on the wrong dose of medicine, you may have an increased risk of getting: problems with your heart (including coronary heart disease and heart failure ) problems with your bones (including osteoporosis ) In very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. It's more common in older people. This is an emergency and requires treatment in hospital. An underactive thyroid and pregnancy If you have an underactive thyroid and are pregnant or planning to get pregnant, tell your GP. You'll need further tests and it's likely your dose of levothyroxine will need to change while you're pregnant. If it's not treated, an underactive thyroid can increase your chance or having serious complications in pregnancy, including high blood pressure ( pre-eclampsia ), birth defects, premature birth or miscarriage. Treatment usually helps prevent these complications, and the GP will talk to you about any risks. Help and support for an underactive thyroid As well as support from your doctor, you may find it helpful to get support from other people with an underactive thyroid. There are national charities that offer support and information for people with thyroid conditions including underactive thyroid. British Thyroid Foundation The British Thyroid Foundation offers information and support including patient stories, online forums and telephone support.

    "text": "Undescended testicles Undescended testicles are where the testicles are not in the usual place in the scrotum. It’s common in young boys, and the testicles often move to where they should be on their own, but sometimes surgery is needed. Symptoms of undescended testicles The main symptom of undescended testicles is not being able to feel 2 round glands (testicles) inside your child's scrotum. You may only be able to feel 1 testicle, or neither. Undescended testicles are usually found when your child has their newborn physical examination . This examination usually happens in the first few days after they're born. It's rare for adult men to have undescended testicles. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you or your child may have undescended testicles you notice any changes in your or your child's testicles that are not usual Treatment for undescended testicles Undescended testicles often move into their usual place in the scrotum in the first 12 weeks after your child is born. During this time, your child's testicles will usually be checked at their regular health visitor appointments ( health and development reviews) If only 1 testicle is affected, and it has not moved into the scrotum within 4 to 5 months, your child will usually be referred to a specialist. If both testicles are affected, your child may be referred to a specialist sooner, usually after 8 weeks. Your child may need surgery to move their testicles to the correct place (orchidopexy). Surgery will usually be done when your child is around 1 year old. It’s safe and effective, and your child’s surgeon will explain what happens and what to expect. If undescended testicles are not treated, they can cause your child health problems. Causes of undescended testicles It's not always known what causes undescended testicles. When a baby boy is developing inside the womb, their testicles grow inside their tummy and later move down into the scrotum before they’re born. But sometimes the testicles do not move into the usual place. Your baby may be at higher risk of undescended testicles if they: are born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a low birth weight have relatives who had undescended testicles Sometimes it can be caused by another condition, but this is rare.

It's important to get it treated to avoid it spreading to other people. Gonococcal urethritis is when the infection is caused by gonorrhoea. Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) or non-specific urethritis is more common. This is when the infection is caused by something other than gonorrhoea, such as chlamydia. Symptoms of urethritis Symptoms of urethritis include: pain or a burning feeling when you pee white or cloudy discharge from the vagina or penis an irritated or sore tip of the penis If urethritis is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), it can take a few days or weeks for symptoms to appear after having sex. Urethritis does not always have symptoms. If you have sex without a condom, a person with urethritis and no symptoms can pass on the infection without realising it. Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if: you think you might have urethritis or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) It's important to get it treated to avoid it spreading to other people. Find a sexual health clinic What happens at your appointment If you have symptoms of urethritis, you may have: a swab test – a cotton bud takes a sample from the urethra (this can feel uncomfortable for a few seconds) a urine test – you'll be asked not to pee for at least 2 hours before giving a urine sample as this can help make the results more reliable You may also be offered tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Healthcare professionals at the clinic or GP surgery will tell you when you'll get your test results. If the test shows that you have urethritis, anyone you've had sex with recently should be contacted and asked to get tested and treated if needed. The sexual health clinic can advise you about this. Find out more about visiting a sexual health clinic . Treatment for urethritis Urethritis is usually treated with antibiotics. It may take a week or two for your symptoms to disappear completely. Any current sexual partners may also need treatment. Avoid having sex (including oral sex) until you and any sexual partners have finished treatment and the symptoms have gone. You may be asked to come back for another appointment in 1 to 2 weeks to check the treatment has worked. Causes of urethritis Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia. You can get it if you have unprotected sex (without a condom) with someone who has the infection. Rarely, it can be caused by damaging the urethra (for example, from a urinary catheter). Sometimes no cause for the urethritis can be found. How to avoid getting urethritis You can reduce your chances of getting urethritis by: using a condom every time you have vaginal sex or anal sex using a condom to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina if you have oral sex not sharing sex toys, or washing them and covering them with a new condom before anyone else uses them You can get tested for urethritis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) even if you do not have symptoms. This can help you avoid passing on infections without realising it. Complications of urethritis Although complications are rare, sometimes urethritis can cause further problems such as: reactive arthritis – where the immune system attacks the joints or eyes, which can cause joint pain and conjunctivitis epididymitis – where the infection spreads to the testicles pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – where the infection spreads to the womb or fallopian tubes (if untreated this can cause infertility) Page last reviewed: 10 May 2023 Next review due: 10 May 2026"

    "text": "Overview - Urinary incontinence Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Non-surgical treatment Surgery and procedures Incontinence products 10 ways to stop leaks Urinary incontinence is the unintentional passing of urine. It's a common problem thought to affect millions of people. There are several types of urinary incontinence, including: stress incontinence – when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure; for example, when you cough or laugh urge (urgency) incontinence – when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pee, or soon afterwards overflow incontinence (chronic urinary retention) – when you're unable to fully empty your bladder, which causes frequent leaking total incontinence – when your bladder cannot store any urine at all, which causes you to pass urine constantly or have frequent leaking It's also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence. Find out more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence . When to seek medical advice See a GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a common problem and you should not feel embarrassed talking to them about your symptoms. This can also be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with a GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may do a pelvic examination (if you have a vagina) or a rectal examination (if you have a penis). The GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate. You may also be referred to a specialist for more tests. Find out about diagnosing urinary incontinence . Causes of urinary incontinence Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening of or damage to the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter. Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscles, which control the bladder. Overflow incontinence is often caused by an obstruction or blockage in your bladder, which prevents it from emptying fully. Total incontinence may be caused by a problem with the bladder from birth, a spinal injury, or a small, tunnel like hole that can form between the bladder and a nearby area (fistula). Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence, including: pregnancy and vaginal birth obesity a family history of incontinence increasing age – although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing Find out more about the causes of urinary incontinence . Treating urinary incontinence Non-surgical treatments Initially, a GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include: lifestyle changes such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol pelvic floor exercises , where you strengthen your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them bladder training, where you learn ways to wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products , such as absorbent pads and handheld urinals. Medicine may be recommended if you're still unable to manage your symptoms. Find out more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence . Surgical treatments Surgery may also be considered. The procedures that are suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have. Surgical treatment for stress incontinence, such as a sling procedure, is used to reduce pressure on the bladder or strengthen the muscles that control urination. Surgery to treat urge incontinence includes enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles. Find out more about surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence . Preventing urinary incontinence It's not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it happening. These include: maintaining a healthy weight changing your drinking habits, including cutting down on alcohol doing pelvic floor muscle exercises Healthy weight Being obese can increase your risk of urinary incontinence. You may be able to lower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and healthy eating . Use the healthy weight calculator to see if you are a healthy weight for your height. Get more information and advice about managing your weight. Drinking habits Depending on your particular bladder problem, a GP can advise you about the amount of fluids you should drink. If you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to produce more urine and irritate your bladder. The recommended weekly limit for alcohol consumption is 14 units. A unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. Find out more about alcohol units . If you have to urinate frequently during the night (nocturia), try drinking less in the hours before you go to bed. However, make sure you still drink enough fluids during the day. Pelvic floor exercises Being pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow of urine from your bladder. If you're pregnant, strengthening your pelvic floor muscles may help prevent urinary incontinence. Find out more about pelvic floor muscle exercises during pregnancy. Everyone may benefit from strengthening their pelvic floor muscles with pelvic floor exercises. Find out more about pelvic floor exercises .

Treatment for UTIs that keep coming back (recurrent UTIs) If your UTI comes back after treatment, or you have 2 UTIs in 6 months, a GP may: prescribe a different antibiotic or prescribe a low-dose antibiotic to take for up to 6 months prescribe a vaginal cream, gel, tablet, pessary or ring containing oestrogen, if you are in perimenopause or have gone through the menopause prescribe tablets that treat the infection and stop it from coming back refer you to a specialist for further tests and treatments Chronic UTIs In some people UTI symptoms do not go away. Short-term antibiotics do not work and urine tests do not show an infection. This might mean you have a chronic (long-term) UTI. This can be caused by bacteria entering the lining of the bladder. Because urine tests do not always pick up the infection and the symptoms can be similar to other conditions, chronic UTIs can be hard to diagnose. Chronic UTIs might be treated with antibiotics that you take for a long time. Chronic UTIs can have a big impact on your quality of life. If you have been treated for a UTI but you still have symptoms, speak to your GP about chronic UTIs and ask to be referred to a specialist. Things you can do yourself To help ease symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI): take paracetamol up to 4 times a day to reduce pain and a high temperature you can give children liquid paracetamol rest and drink enough fluids so you pass pale urine regularly during the day avoid having sex Some people take cystitis sachets or cranberry drinks and products every day to prevent UTIs from happening, which may help. But there's no evidence they help ease symptoms or treat a UTI if the infection has already started. A pharmacist can help with UTIs You can ask a pharmacist about treatments for a UTI. A pharmacist can: offer advice on things that can help you get better suggest the best painkiller to take provide the same treatment as a GP, if it's suitable for you tell you if you need to see a GP about your symptoms Find a pharmacy Causes of urinary tract infections (UTIs) Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract. The bacteria enter through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra). Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause an infection. Things that increase the risk of bacteria getting into the bladder include: having sex pregnancy conditions that block the urinary tract – such as kidney stones conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder – such as an enlarged prostate in men and constipation in children urinary catheters (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine) having a weakened immune system – for example, people with diabetes or people having chemotherapy not drinking enough fluids not keeping the genital area clean and dry How to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) There are some things you can try to help prevent a urinary tract infection (UTI) happening or prevent it returning. Do wipe from front to back when you go to the toilet keep the genital area clean and dry drink plenty of fluids, particularly water – so that you regularly pee during the day and do not feel thirsty wash the skin around the vagina with water before and after sex pee as soon as possible after sex promptly change nappies or incontinence pads if they're soiled Don’t do not use scented soap do not hold your pee in if you feel the urge to go do not rush when going for a pee – try to fully empty your bladder do not wear tight synthetic underwear, such as nylon do not drink lots of alcoholic drinks, as they may irritate your bladder do not have lots of sugary food or drinks, as they may encourage bacteria to grow do not use condoms or a diaphragm or cap with spermicidal lube on them – try non-spermicidal lube or a different type of contraception Other ways to prevent some UTIs coming back If you keep getting a bladder infection ( cystitis ), there's some evidence it may be helpful to take: D-mannose – a sugar you can buy as a powder or tablets to take every day cranberry products – available as juice, tablets or capsules to take every day Speak to your doctor before taking any of these during pregnancy. Be aware that D-mannose and cranberry products can contain a lot of sugar. If you're taking warfarin, you should avoid cranberry products.

Varicose eczema tends to be a long-term problem. However, treatments are available to help keep it under control. Symptoms of varicose eczema Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/459237/view Credit: ST BARTHOLOMEW HOSPITAL / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY : https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/643944/view Credit: Science Photo Library: https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1145274/view The affected skin can change colour and become: itchy and swollen dry and flaky scaly, crusty or blistered On white skin it looks red or brown. On black or brown skin it tends to look dark brown, purple or grey and can sometimes be more difficult to see. There may be periods when these symptoms improve and periods when they are more severe. Your legs may become swollen, especially at the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs. Some people also have other symptoms, such as: tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis) small, white scars (atrophie blanche) pain eczema affecting other parts of the body If varicose eczema is not treated, leg ulcers can develop. These are wounds that form where the skin has become damaged. When to get medical advice See a GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. Your doctor will often be able to make a diagnosis simply by looking at your skin. A GP will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema. To help make a diagnosis, a GP may want to know if you have ever had health conditions such as: varicose veins – swollen and enlarged veins DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – a blood clot in the veins of your legs leg ulcers – areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue surgery or injury to your legs A GP may also check the pulse in your feet and may do an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you. The ABPI test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries – in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use. Referral to a specialist You may be referred to a hospital specialist for further tests. You might see a doctor or surgeon who specialises in conditions affecting blood vessels (vascular specialist), or a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist). Causes of varicose eczema Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in the leg veins. When small valves in the veins stop working properly, it's difficult for blood to be pushed upwards against gravity and it can leak backwards. This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It's thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid. Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins are not working properly. Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are some factors that increase the chance of this happening, including: sex – varicose eczema is more common in women obesity – this can increase the pressure in your leg veins pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins a family history of venous insufficiency (where the veins in your legs have trouble sending blood back to your heart) not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation of blood in your leg veins having previously had DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – blood clots that develop in leg veins which can damage the valves in your veins increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation Treating varicose eczema For most people, treatment involves a combination of: self-help measures – including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it from becoming dry topical corticosteroids – ointments or creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms compression stockings – specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that squeeze your legs tightly at the foot and ankle and become looser further up your leg, helping to improve your circulation If these treatments do not help, a GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) in case there's another cause for your symptoms, or if they're concerned you may also have contact dermatitis . If you have varicose veins, you may be referred to a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist) who can talk to you about the treatment options for varicose veins . Find out more about treating varicose eczema . Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of eczema contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that happens when you come into contact with a particular substance discoid eczema – a long-term type of eczema that appears as circular or oval patches on the skin Page last reviewed: 20 April 2023 Next review due: 20 April 2026 Next : Treatment"

Do try to keep to a healthy weight put your legs up when possible – for example, lie down with your legs on cushions exercise regularly, such as running or walking, to improve blood flow use a moisturising cream or lotion if you have dry, flaky or itchy skin try not to injure your legs, to help prevent bleeding Don’t do not stand for long periods do not sit for long periods, unless your feet are raised do not smoke, as it damages your veins – get help to quit smoking Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have varicose veins and: you have symptoms such as pain, itching or swelling in your legs you get a sore on your leg that has not healed after 2 weeks Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have varicose veins that are bleeding You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Treatment for varicose veins Varicose veins do not always need treatment. A GP may refer you to a specialist for tests and treatment if you have: symptoms such as pain, heaviness, swollen legs, itching or skin changes any complications, such as ulcers on your legs Treatment to improve how varicose veins look is not usually available on the NHS if they're not causing any other problems. You may be able to pay for it privately. Assessment and treatment from a specialist If you're referred to a specialist they'll usually do a test called duplex ultrasound to confirm if you have varicose veins and plan your treatment. This is a type of scan to check your blood flow. There are several types of treatment that may be offered, including: procedures to block blood flow in the veins, such as endothermal ablation and foam sclerotherapy surgery to remove varicose veins compression stockings The specialist will explain which treatment may be best for you, and the benefits and risks. Endothermal ablation This is usually the first choice of treatment for varicose veins. It works by blocking blood flow in the veins, so they become less swollen. The main steps are: You'll usually be awake during the procedure. You'll have a local anaesthetic , so you will not feel any pain. A thin tube called a catheter is passed up your vein, from a small cut at your ankle or knee. An ultrasound scan is used to place the catheter. A device is put through the catheter and energy from radio waves (radiofrequency ablation) or a laser (endovenous laser treatment) is used to heat the vein that's causing your symptoms. This closes it off, so that blood stops flowing through it. The catheter is slowly removed. You'll have the procedure in a hospital or clinic. You'll be able to go home the same day. You may need to wear compression stockings for about a week. You may have some pain and bruising, but you should be able to go back to most of your usual activities straight away. Foam sclerotherapy You'll usually be offered foam sclerotherapy if endothermal ablation is not suitable for you. The main steps are: You'll be awake during the procedure. You'll have a local anaesthetic , so you will not feel any pain. You'll have injections into your vein of a chemical mixed with air (foam). An ultrasound scan is used to make sure the injections are in the right place. The chemical blocks the vein, so that blood stops flowing through it. You'll have the procedure in a hospital or clinic. You'll be able to go home the same day. You may need to wear compression stockings for about a week. You may have some pain and bruising, but you should be able to go back to most of your usual activities straight away. Surgery to remove varicose veins (ligation and stripping) You may be offered surgery to remove varicose veins, called ligation and stripping, if simpler procedures are not suitable for you. The main steps are: The surgeon will mark your legs to show where the vein needs to be removed. You'll usually be asleep during the operation. You'll have a general anaesthetic , so you will not feel any pain. The surgeon makes 1 cut in your upper leg (groin) and a 2nd cut lower down your leg, at your knee or ankle. The surgeon finds the vein through the 1st cut and ties it, to stop blood flowing. A thin, flexible wire is passed down the vein to the 2nd cut. The surgeon uses the wire to pull the vein out. The cuts are closed using stitches that dissolve so they do not need to be removed. You can usually go home the same day. Moving around may be uncomfortable for a few days, and you may have some pain and bruising for a few weeks. You may need to take 1 to 2 weeks off work. Your leg will be tightly bandaged or you'll need to wear compression stockings for about a week. Compression stockings Compression stockings work by putting pressure on your lower legs. This improves your blood flow and can help with swelling and pain. You'll only be offered compression stockings for varicose veins if procedures or surgery are not suitable for you, or if you do not need other treatments. They're not suitable if you have problems with blood flow in your arteries. A specialist can check for this. There are different types of stockings, and it's important to talk to a doctor or pharmacist to make sure you get the right type for you. It's best to wear them during the day and remove them at bedtime. Information: Treating varicose veins in pregnancy If you get varicose veins during pregnancy, you may be able to use compression stockings, but procedures or surgery to treat them are not usually recommended while you're pregnant. Varicose veins often get better or go away after your baby's born. Causes of varicose veins Varicose veins happen when the valves that control the flow of blood in your vein do not work properly. This causes blood to build up and put pressure on the vein, which makes it swell and twist. Varicose veins are very common and anyone can get them, but it's more likely to happen if you: are a woman are older are overweight are pregnant spend a lot of time standing or sitting have other family members with varicose veins have had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Complications of varicose veins Varicose veins do not usually cause any serious problems. But they can sometimes cause complications including: bleeding itchy, flaky, dry skin over your veins ( varicose eczema ) sores that take a long time to heal ( venous leg ulcers ) blood clots under your skin that cause hard, painful veins ( superficial vein thrombosis ) blood clots deeper inside your leg ( deep vein thrombosis – DVT ) Page last reviewed: 01 July 2024 Next review due: 01 July 2027"

Vascular dementia tends to get worse over time, although it's sometimes possible to slow it down. Symptoms of vascular dementia Vascular dementia can start suddenly or begin slowly over time. Symptoms include: slowness of thought difficulty with planning and understanding problems with concentration changes to your mood, personality or behaviour feeling disoriented and confused difficulty walking and keeping balance symptoms of Alzheimer's disease , such as problems with memory and language (many people with vascular dementia also have Alzheimer's disease) These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult and someone with the condition may eventually be unable to look after themselves. Getting medical advice See a GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia, especially if you're over 65 years of age. If it's found at an early stage, treatment may be able to stop vascular dementia getting worse, or at least slow it down. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with a GP and perhaps suggest that you go with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms. They can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed. Find out more about how to get a dementia diagnosis . Tests for vascular dementia There's no single test for vascular dementia. The tests that are needed to make a diagnosis include: an assessment of symptoms – for example, whether these are typical symptoms of vascular dementia a full medical history, including asking about a history of conditions related to vascular dementia, such as strokes or high blood pressure an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve several tasks and questions a brain scan, such as an MRI scan or CT scan , to look for any changes that have happened in your brain Find out more about the tests used to diagnose dementia . Treatments for vascular dementia There's currently no cure for vascular dementia and there's no way to reverse any loss of brain cells that happened before the condition was diagnosed. But treatment can sometimes help slow down vascular dementia. Treatment aims to tackle the underlying cause, which may reduce the speed at which brain cells are lost. This will often involve: eating a healthy, balanced diet losing weight if you're overweight stopping smoking getting fit cutting down on alcohol taking medicines, such as those used to treat high blood pressure , lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots Other treatments, including physiotherapy , occupational therapy , dementia activities (such as memory cafes) and psychological therapies , can help reduce the impact of any existing problems. Outlook for vascular dementia Vascular dementia will usually get worse over time. This can happen in sudden steps, with periods in between where the symptoms do not change much, but it's difficult to predict when this will happen. Home-based help will usually be needed, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home . Although treatment can help, vascular dementia can significantly shorten life expectancy. But this is highly variable, and many people live for several years with the condition, or die from some other cause. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you're not alone. The NHS and social services , as well as voluntary organisations, can provide advice and support for you and your family. Causes of vascular dementia Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills brain cells. This can happen as a result of: narrowing and blockage of the small blood vessels inside the brain a single stroke , where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off lots of \"mini strokes\" (also called transient ischaemic attacks, or TIAs) that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain In many cases, these problems are linked to underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes , and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and being overweight. Tackling these might reduce your risk of vascular dementia in later life, although it's not yet clear exactly how much your risk of dementia can be reduced.

    "text": "Vasculitis Vasculitis is the name of a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the blood vessels. Inflammation is your immune system's natural response to injury or infection. It causes swelling and can help the body deal with invading germs. But in vasculitis, for some reason the immune system attacks healthy blood vessels, causing them to become swollen and narrow. This may be triggered by an infection, another underlying condition, or a medicine, although often the cause is unknown. Vasculitis can range from a minor problem that just affects the skin, to a more serious illness that causes problems with organs like the heart or kidneys. There are many types of vasculitis. The rest of this page discusses a range of potential causes. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also called Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects adults around 38 to 54. It can cause: asthma cold-like symptoms caused by allergies (allergic rhinitis) a high temperature muscle and joint pain tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss It can also affect the nerves, causing weakness, pins and needles or numbness, and sometimes damages the kidneys or heart muscle. It's usually treated with steroid medicine . The Vasculitis UK website has more information about eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) Temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis, is a type of vasculitis where the arteries at the side of the head (the temples) become inflamed. It mostly affects adults over the age of 50 and can cause: aching and soreness around the temples jaw muscle pain while eating headaches double vision or vision loss Some people with temporal arteritis also get polymyalgia rheumatica (muscle pain and stiffness in the shoulders, neck and hips). The main treatment for temporal arteritis is steroid medicine . Find out more about temporal arteritis When to get medical help Get advice from 111 now if you think you might have temporal arteritis. It can lead to serious problems like stroke and blindness if not treated quickly. 111 will tell you what to do. They can arrange a phone call from a nurse or doctor if you need one. Go to 111 online or call 111. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also called Wegener's granulomatosis, is a type of vasculitis that affects blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, ears, lungs and kidneys. It mainly affects middle-aged or older people and can cause: a high temperature night sweats inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) nosebleeds and crusting of the nose shortness of breath and coughing up blood kidney problems Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, as it can lead to organ failure. It's usually treated with steroid medicine or other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. Find out more about granulomatosis with polyangiitis Henoch-Schönlein purpura Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a type of vasculitis that can affect the skin, kidneys or bowel. It's more common in children, and it's thought to be triggered by the body reacting to an infection. It can cause: a rash that looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin) joint pain tummy (abdominal) pain diarrhoea being sick blood in urine or poo Henoch-Schönlein purpura is not usually serious and often gets better without treatment. Find out more about Henoch-Schönlein purpura Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease is a condition that mainly affects children under the age of 5. The characteristic symptoms are a high temperature that lasts for 5 days or more, and possibly 1 or more of the following symptoms: a rash swollen glands in the neck dry, cracked lips red fingers or toes red eyes Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a solution of antibodies, and aspirin are the 2 main medicines used to treat Kawasaki disease. Aspirin is not usually recommended for children under 16, so do not give aspirin to your child unless advised to by their doctor. Find out more about Kawasaki disease Microscopic polyangiitis Microscopic polyangiitis is a rare and potentially serious long-term type of vasculitis that most often develops in middle-aged people. It can affect any organ, but often affects the lungs, kidneys and nerves. It can cause: a rash shortness of breath and coughing up blood red and sore eyes pins and needles or numbness joint stiffness muscle aches loss of appetite losing weight without trying feeling tired flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and an aching body kidney problems Microscopic polyangiitis is usually treated with steroid medicine or other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system.

    "text": "Overview - Venous leg ulcer Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention A leg ulcer is a long-lasting (chronic) sore that takes more than 2 weeks to heal. It usually develops on the inside of the leg, between the knee and the ankle. The symptoms of a venous leg ulcer include pain, itching and swelling in the affected leg. There may also be discoloured or hardened skin around the ulcer, and the sore may produce a foul-smelling discharge. See your GP if you think you have a leg ulcer, as it'll need specialist treatment to help it heal. Your GP will examine your leg and may carry out additional tests to rule out other conditions. Find out how a venous leg ulcer is diagnosed What causes venous leg ulcers? A venous leg ulcer is the most common type of leg ulcer, accounting for more than 60% of all cases. Venous leg ulcers can develop after a minor injury, if persistently high pressure in the veins of the legs has weakened the skin. Find out more about the causes of venous leg ulcers Who's affected Venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK, although they become much more common with age. It's estimated around 1 in 50 people over the age of 80 has one. You're more at risk of developing one if you previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or find it difficult to walk because of a problem such as: osteoarthritis a leg injury obesity paralysis You're also more at risk if you recently had an operation on your leg, such as a hip replacement or knee replacement . People with swollen and enlarged veins (varicose veins) also have a higher risk of developing venous leg ulcers. How venous leg ulcers are treated Most venous leg ulcers heal within 6 months if they're treated by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. But some ulcers may take longer to heal, and a very small number never heal. Treatment usually involves: cleaning and dressing the wound using compression, such as bandages or stockings, to improve the flow of blood in the legs Antibiotics may also be used if the ulcer becomes infected, but they do not help ulcers heal. But unless the underlying cause of the ulcer is addressed, there's a high risk of a venous leg ulcer coming back after treatment. Underlying causes could include immobility, obesity, previous DVT or varicose veins. Find out more about how venous leg ulcers are treated Can venous leg ulcers be prevented? There are several ways to help prevent developing a venous leg ulcer in people at risk. These include: wearing compression stockings losing weight if you're overweight exercising regularly elevating your leg when possible stopping smoking if you smoke These measures are particularly important if you previously had a leg ulcer. This is because you're at increased risk of having another one in the same leg within months or years. Find out how to prevent venous leg ulcers Other types of leg ulcer Other common types of leg ulcer include: arterial leg ulcers – caused by poor blood circulation in the arteries diabetic leg ulcers – caused by the high blood sugar associated with diabetes vasculitic leg ulcers – associated with chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus traumatic leg ulcers – caused by injury to the leg malignant leg ulcers – caused by a tumour of the skin of the leg Most ulcers caused by artery disease or diabetes occur on the foot rather than the leg.

Symptoms of vertigo Vertigo feels like you or everything around you is spinning – enough to affect your balance. It's more than just feeling dizzy . A vertigo attack can last from a few seconds to hours. If you have severe vertigo, it can last for many days or months. Things you can do to help ease vertigo There are things you can do to ease vertigo symptoms when they're happening, and to reduce how often it happens. Do lie still in a quiet, dark room to reduce the spinning feeling move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities sit down straight away when you feel dizzy turn on the lights if you get up at night use a walking stick if you're at risk of falling sleep with your head slightly raised on 2 or more pillows get out of bed slowly and sit on the edge of the bed for a while before standing up try to relax – anxiety can make vertigo worse Don’t do not bend over to pick things up – squat to lower yourself instead do not stretch your neck – for example, while reaching up to a high shelf Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have vertigo that will not go away or keeps coming back What happens at your appointment If you have vertigo, a GP will ask about your symptoms to try to find out what could be causing them. A simple test that involves you moving quickly from a sitting to a lying position might be done to check your balance. This could bring on symptoms. You might also be referred to a specialist for further tests. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You have vertigo and: have a severe headache are being sick or feel very sick have a very high temperature or feel hot and shivery You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You have vertigo and: double vision or loss of vision hearing loss trouble speaking leg or arm weakness, numbness or tingling Always take someone who cannot be woken up to A&E or call 999. Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatment for vertigo Most people with vertigo get better without treatment. Treatment will depend on the cause. A GP might prescribe antibiotics if it's caused by an infection. You could also be given exercises to do to try to correct your balance. Antihistamines can sometimes help with vertigo symptoms. Important: Driving and vertigo If you drive, you must tell the DVLA about your vertigo. Get more information on driving with vertigo on GOV.UK What causes vertigo Inner ear problems, which affect balance, are the most common causes of vertigo. These include: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where specific head movements cause vertigo labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection caused by a cold or flu virus vestibular neuritis – inflammation of the vestibular nerve Ménière's disease – a rare inner ear condition, which sometimes involves ringing in the ear ( tinnitus ) or loss of hearing Other things that can cause vertigo include: migraine some types of medicine – check the leaflet to see if it's listed as a side effect Sometimes the cause is unknown.

    "text": "Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis are types of inner ear infection that affect your balance. They usually get better on their own within a few weeks. Symptoms of labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis The most common symptoms of labyrinthitis are: dizziness or feeling that everything around you is spinning ( vertigo ) feeling unsteady and off balance – you might find it difficult to stay upright or walk in a straight line feeling or being sick hearing loss ringing in your ears ( tinnitus ) The symptoms of vestibular neuritis are very similar, but it does not cause hearing loss or tinnitus. Symptoms can start suddenly. They may be there when you wake up and get worse as the day goes on. The symptoms often ease after a few days. You'll usually get your balance back over 2 to 6 weeks, although it can take longer. Things you can do to help Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis usually gets better on its own. But there are things you can do to ease the symptoms. Do lie still in a dark room if you feel very dizzy drink plenty of water if you're being sick – it's best to drink little and often try to avoid noise and bright lights try to get enough sleep – tiredness can make symptoms worse start to go for walks outside as soon as possible – it may help to have someone with you to steady you until you become confident when you're out and about, keep your eyes focused on a fixed object, rather than looking around all the time Don’t do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you feel dizzy do not drink alcohol – it can make symptoms worse Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis that do not get better after a few days or are getting worse you've been diagnosed with labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis and your symptoms have not improved within a week of starting treatment The GP may refer you to a hospital specialist. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have sudden hearing loss in 1 ear You may need to be referred to a specialist for tests, and possibly treatment. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Information: Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis – what's the difference? Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis are problems with different parts of the inner ear, which are needed for balance: labyrinthitis is inflammation of the labyrinth – a maze of fluid-filled channels in the inner ear vestibular neuritis is inflammation of the vestibular nerve – the nerve in the inner ear that sends messages to the brain The symptoms of vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis are very similar. However, if your hearing is affected, then labyrinthitis is the cause. This is because inflammation of the labyrinth affects hearing, while inflammation of the vestibular nerve does not. Treatment from a GP for labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis If you have labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis, a GP may prescribe antihistamines or motion sickness tablets for up to 3 days. Do not take them for any longer, as they can slow down your recovery. Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis is usually caused by a viral infection, such as a cold or flu, so antibiotics will not help. But a GP may prescribe antibiotics if they think your infection is bacterial. Exercises for long-term balance problems Sometimes, balance problems can last for much longer – for many months or even years. Vestibular rehabilitation is a series of exercises that can help restore balance. You should only do the exercises under the supervision of a specialist such as a physiotherapist or audiologist. You can ask a GP to refer you to a physiotherapist, or it may be possible to refer yourself directly. Waiting lists for accessing NHS physiotherapy can be long and you may prefer to pay for private treatment. Most private physiotherapists accept direct self-referrals.

    "title": "Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma)",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acoustic-neuroma/",
    "text": "Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous (benign) brain tumour. It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma. A benign brain tumour is a growth in the brain that usually grows slowly over many years and does not spread to other parts of the body. Acoustic neuromas grow on the nerve used for hearing and balance, which can cause problems such as hearing loss and unsteadiness. They can sometimes be serious if they become very large, but most are picked up and treated before they reach this stage. Acoustic neuromas tend to affect adults aged 30 to 60 and usually have no obvious cause, although a small number of cases are the result of a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) . Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma An acoustic neuroma may not cause any obvious symptoms at first. Any symptoms tend to develop gradually and often include: hearing loss that usually only affects 1 ear hearing sounds that come from inside the body ( tinnitus ) the sensation that you're moving or spinning ( vertigo ) A large acoustic neuroma can also sometimes cause: persistent headaches temporary blurred or double vision numbness, pain or weakness on 1 side of the face problems with limb co-ordination ( ataxia ) on 1 side of the body voice changes or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Getting medical advice See your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you're worried could be caused by an acoustic neuroma. Acoustic neuromas can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as Ménière's disease . If your GP thinks you could have an acoustic neuroma, you'll be referred to a hospital or clinic for further tests, such as: hearing tests to check for hearing problems and determine whether they're caused by a problem with your nerves an MRI scan , which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your head a CT scan , which uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of the inside of your head Treatments for acoustic neuromas There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health. The main options are: monitoring the tumour – small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, and treatment is generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger brain surgery – surgery to remove all or some of the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger stereotactic radiosurgery – small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger All these options carry some risks. For example, surgery and radiosurgery can sometimes cause facial numbness or an inability to move part of your face ( paralysis ). Speak to your specialist about the best option for you and what the benefits and risks are. Outlook for acoustic neuromas Large acoustic neuromas can be serious because they can sometimes cause a life-threatening build-up of fluid in the brain ( hydrocephalus ). But it's rare for them to reach this stage. Many grow very slowly or not at all, and those that grow more quickly can be treated before they become too big. Even with treatment, symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and affect your ability to work, communicate and drive. These problems may need additional treatment. Read more about treating hearing loss and treating tinnitus . An acoustic neuroma can occasionally return after treatment. This is thought to happen to around 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal. You'll probably continue having regular MRI scans after any treatment to check if the tumour is growing again or coming back. Page last reviewed: 29 November 2022 Next review due: 29 November 2025"

    "text": "Overview - Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Contents Overview Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that cannot function properly. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin. Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell. Symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including: extreme tiredness a lack of energy pins and needles a sore and red tongue mouth ulcers muscle weakness problems with your vision psychological problems, which can range from mild depression or anxiety to confusion and dementia problems with memory, understanding and judgement Some of these problems can also happen if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate but do not have anaemia. When to see a GP See a GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test. It's important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. This is because although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible. Causes of a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These include: pernicious anaemia – where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK a lack of these vitamins in your diet – this is uncommon, but can happen if you have a vegan diet and do not take vitamin B12 supplements or eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 , follow a restrictive diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time medicine – certain medicines, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74. Treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins. Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first. Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections. Treatments may last until your vitamin B12 levels have improved or you may need treatment for the rest of your life. Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for 4 months. In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it coming back. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products and specially fortified foods. Good sources of folate include green vegetables, such as broccoli, brussels sprouts and peas. Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Although it's uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications , particularly if you have been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time. Potential complications can include: problems with the nervous system temporary infertility heart conditions pregnancy complications and birth defects Adults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure. Some complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others, such as problems with the nervous system, can sometimes be permanent.

    "title": "Overview-Vitiligo",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitiligo/",
    "text": "Overview - Vitiligo Contents Overview Treatment Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of melanin, which is the pigment in skin. Vitiligo can affect any area of skin, but it commonly happens on the face, neck and hands, and in skin creases. The pale areas of skin are more vulnerable to sunburn, so it's important to take extra care when in the sun and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF). Symptoms of vitiligo The areas of skin most commonly affected by vitiligo include: mouth and eyes fingers and wrists armpits groin genitals inside your mouth It can also sometimes develop where there are hair roots, such as on your scalp. The lack of melanin in your skin can turn the hair in the affected area white or grey. Vitiligo often starts as a pale patch of skin that gradually turns completely white. The centre of a patch may be white, with paler skin around it. If there are blood vessels under the skin, the patch may be slightly pink, rather than white. The edges of the patch may be smooth or irregular. They're sometimes red and inflamed, or there's brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation). Vitiligo does not cause discomfort to your skin, such as dryness, but the patches may occasionally be itchy. The condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches, but others get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin. There's no way of predicting how much skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent. Types of vitiligo There are 2 main types of vitiligo: non-segmental vitiligo segmental vitiligo In rare cases, it's possible for vitiligo to affect your whole body. This is known as universal vitiligo. Non-segmental vitiligo Credit: CUSTOM MEDICAL STOCK PHOTO/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/263334/view In non-segmental vitiligo (also called bilateral or generalised vitiligo), the symptoms often appear on both sides of your body as symmetrical white patches. Symmetrical patches can appear on the: backs of your hands arms skin around body openings, such as the eyes knees elbows feet Non-segmental vitiligo is the most common type of vitiligo, affecting around 9 in 10 people with the condition. Segmental vitiligo Credit: SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/263389/view In segmental vitiligo (also known as unilateral or localised vitiligo), the white patches only affect one area of your body. Segmental vitiligo is less common than non-segmental vitiligo, although it's more common in children. It usually starts earlier and affects around 3 in 10 children with vitiligo. What causes vitiligo? Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a pigment called melanin in the skin. Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes, and it gives your skin its colour. In vitiligo, there are not enough working melanocytes to produce enough melanin in your skin. This causes white patches to develop on your skin or hair. Autoimmune conditions Non-segmental vitiligo (the most common type) is thought to be an autoimmune condition. In autoimmune conditions, the immune system does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells and tissue. If you have non-segmental vitiligo, your immune system destroys the melanocyte skin cells that make melanin. Vitiligo is also associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), but not everyone with vitiligo will develop these conditions. Risk factors You may be at increased risk of developing non-segmental vitiligo if: other members of your family have it there's a family history of other autoimmune conditions – for example, if one of your parents has pernicious anaemia (an autoimmune condition that affects the stomach) you have another autoimmune condition you have melanoma (a type of skin cancer) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) you have particular changes in your genes that are known to be linked to non-segmental vitiligo Neurochemicals Segmental vitiligo (the less common type) is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in your skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells. Triggers It's possible that vitiligo may be triggered by particular events, such as: stressful events, such as childbirth skin damage, such as severe sunburn or cuts (this is known as the Koebner response) hormonal changes to the body, such as puberty problems with the liver or kidneys exposure to certain chemicals Vitiligo is not caused by an infection and you cannot catch it from someone else who has it. Diagnosing vitiligo A GP will be able to diagnose vitiligo after examining the affected areas of skin. They may ask you if: there's a history of vitiligo in your family there's a history of other autoimmune conditions in your family you've injured the affected areas of skin – for example, whether you've had sunburn or a severe rash there you tan easily in the sun, or whether you burn any areas of skin have got better without treatment, or whether they're getting worse you think your vitiligo is triggered by something you've tried any treatments already A GP may also ask you about the spread of vitiligo and the impact it has on your life. For example, how much it affects your confidence and self-esteem, and whether it affects your job. Wood's lamp If available, the GP may use an ultraviolet (UV) lamp called a Wood's lamp to look at your skin in more detail. You'll need to be in a dark room and the lamp will be held 10 to 13cm away from your skin. The patches of vitiligo will be easier to see under UV light, which will help the GP distinguish vitiligo from other skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor (where there's a loss of pigment due to a fungal infection). Other autoimmune conditions As non-segmental vitiligo is closely associated with other autoimmune conditions, you may be assessed to see whether you have any symptoms that could suggest an autoimmune condition, such as: being tired and lacking energy, which may be a sign of Addison's disease being thirsty and needing to urinate often, which may be a sign of diabetes A blood test may also be needed to check how well your thyroid gland is working. Treating vitiligo If vitiligo is severe or making you unhappy, you may want to consider treatment. The white patches caused by vitiligo are usually permanent, although treatment options are available to reduce their appearance. If the patches are relatively small, skin camouflage cream can be used to cover them up. Steroid creams can also be used on the skin to restore some pigment, however long-term use can cause stretch marks and thinning of the skin If steroid creams do not work, phototherapy (treatment with light) may be used. Although treatment may help restore colour to your skin, the effect does not usually last. Treatment cannot stop the condition spreading. Find out more about treating vitiligo . Complications of vitiligo Vitiligo can sometimes cause other problems. Because of a lack of melanin, your skin will be more vulnerable to the effects of the sun. Make sure you use a strong sunscreen to avoid sunburn . Vitiligo may also be associated with eye problems, such as inflammation of the iris, inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (uveitis) , and a partial loss of hearing (hypoacusis). Problems with confidence and self-esteem are common in people with vitiligo, particularly if it affects areas of skin that are frequently exposed. Help and support Support groups can provide help and advice and may be able to put you in contact with other people with vitiligo. A GP may suggest a group in your local area. The charity The Vitiligo Society is also offers advice and support. Page last reviewed: 22 March 2023 Next review due: 22 March 2026 Next : Treatment"

    "text": "Von Willebrand disease Von Willebrand disease is an inherited condition where your blood does not clot properly, so you bleed more easily. There's no cure but most people have mild symptoms that can be managed. Symptoms of von Willebrand disease Von Willebrand disease does not always cause symptoms unless you have an injury. Sometimes it's found when you have more bleeding than usual after surgery or giving birth. Symptoms of von Willebrand disease can include: bruising easily frequent nosebleeds bleeding gums bleeding more than usual after an injury or cut heavy periods Some people also have more severe symptoms, such as: heavy bleeding that's difficult to stop, for example after an injury or procedure blood in your poo blood in your pee (urine) pain, swelling and stiffness in a joint Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you often get lots or bruises or large bruises you have regular nosebleeds you've had heavy periods for several months, or it's affecting your life you've had blood in your poo for 3 weeks your parent, child, brother or sister has been diagnosed with von Willebrand disease – you may also need tests for this condition Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have blood in your pee your poo is black or dark red You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Go to A&E if: you have a nosebleed that lasts longer than 10 to 15 minutes, or the bleeding seems very heavy you have an injury or cut and cannot stop the bleeding Find your nearest A&E How von Willebrand disease is diagnosed Von Willebrand disease can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms are often mild. A GP may examine you to check symptoms such as bruising. They'll ask about whether you've had bleeding in the past, and whether anyone in your family also has bleeding problems. If they think you could have von Willebrand disease, they'll refer you to a specialist in blood conditions (haematologist). Von Willebrand disease is diagnosed using blood tests . You'll need to have several blood tests over a few days or weeks. If tests show you have von Willebrand disease, the specialist will tell you which type you have. Types 1 and 2 are the most common and usually cause mild symptoms. Type 3 is rare and causes more severe symptoms. Important If you're diagnosed with von Willebrand disease, your immediate family should also be offered tests as there's a chance they could also have the condition. Preventing bleeding if you have von Willebrand disease If you have von Willebrand disease there are things you can do to reduce the risk of bleeding and complications caused by bleeding. Do eat foods containing iron, such as dark-green leafy vegetables, meat and pulses, to help prevent anaemia – your doctor may also suggest taking iron supplements brush your teeth at least twice a day and have regular dental check-ups to help avoid dental treatment for tooth decay keep a first aid kit with you for treating minor injuries consider carrying medical ID in case you have a more serious injury Don’t do not take medicines that can cause bleeding, such as ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) or aspirin do not take any herbal remedies or supplements without checking with a pharmacist or doctor – some can cause problems if you have von Willebrand disease do not take part in sports or activities that are likely to cause injuries, particularly if you have more severe symptoms Important: Getting specialist advice Speak to your specialist care team for advice if: you're due to have surgery, a procedure or dental treatment you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant – you'll need to be monitored during your pregnancy and the birth If you need any medical or dental treatment, it's important to also tell the person treating you that you have von Willebrand disease. Treatments for von Willebrand disease Treatment for von Willebrand disease depends on the type you have and how severe your symptoms are. You can usually use first aid to treat less serious bleeding yourself, such as cuts and grazes or nosebleeds . If you have type 1 or type 2 and mild symptoms you'll only need treatment when you get more serious bleeding, or to help prevent bleeding, for example before surgery or dental treatment. If you have type 3 or more severe symptoms you may also need regular treatment to help prevent bleeding. To treat or prevent bleeding you may be offered: tranexamic acid , usually taken as tablets desmopressin, taken as an injection, through a drip into a vein (infusion), or as a nasal spray – this medicine does not work for everyone, so you'll need a trial first to see if it will help your symptoms a treatment to help your blood clot called factor replacement therapy, given through a drip into your vein (infusion) – this is used for more severe symptoms If you have heavy periods your care team will usually recommend: hormonal contraceptives that can make periods lighter, such as the combined pill or intrauterine system (IUS) tranexamic acid Causes of von Willebrand disease Von Willebrand disease is nearly always caused by the genes you inherit from your parents. The most severe type of von Willebrand disease, called type 3, happens when a child inherits the gene from both parents. If you have type 1 or type 2, there's a 1 in 2 chance that your child will also inherit it. If you have type 3, your children will also have von Willebrand disease, but they'll usually have type 1 or type 2, with less severe symptoms. In very rare cases von Willebrand disease can be caused by other conditions that affect your blood, such as heart problems or blood cancer, or by taking certain medicines. Help and support for von Willebrand disease If you or someone in your family lives with von Willebrand disease you can get support from the Haemophilia Society . Recording information about you and your condition If you have von Willebrand disease, your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Page last reviewed: 08 April 2024 Next review due: 08 April 2027"

Information: Other causes of genital pain Other conditions that can cause genital pain include vaginitis , vaginismus and some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have pain or discomfort in your vulva that does not go away or keeps coming back you find it difficult inserting a tampon into your vagina because of the pain you find having sex difficult because you feel pain, such as burning or stinging You can ask to see a female GP and for someone else to be with you in the room. This could be someone you know or another member of medical staff. What happens at your GP appointment If you see a GP about vulval pain, they'll ask about your symptoms. They may also ask if you've had any skin conditions or infections in your vagina, or if having sex is painful. They may ask if they can examine your vulva and vagina. A cotton bud is often used to gently touch your vulva to see which areas are painful. A swab may be taken to help rule out other conditions that can cause vaginal soreness, such as an infection. If the cause of your vulval pain cannot be found, you may be referred to a specialist for help managing the pain. Treatments for vulvodynia The main aim of treatment for vulvodynia is to help manage the pain. Vulvodynia is often treated by more than one specialist, including: a gynaecologist a physiotherapist a psychologist a pain specialist A number of different treatments may be recommended under the guidance of these specialists.

    "text": "Leptospirosis (Weil's disease) Leptospirosis, also called Weil's disease, is an infection you can get from animals, soil or water. It's rare in the UK. How you get leptospirosis Leptospirosis is spread in the pee of infected animals, most commonly rats, mice, cows, pigs and dogs. You can get leptospirosis if: soil or freshwater (such as water from a river, canal or lake) that contains infected pee gets in your mouth, eyes or a cut, usually during activities like kayaking, outdoor swimming or fishing you touch an infected animal's blood or flesh, usually from working with animals or animal parts It's very rare to get leptospirosis from pets, other people or bites. Symptoms of leptospirosis Most people who get leptospirosis have no symptoms, or mild flu-like symptoms. But some people get seriously ill. Symptoms of leptospirosis may include: high temperature headache body aches and pain tummy ache feeling sick or being sick diarrhoea redness in the white part of your eyes yellowing of the skin (which may be harder to see on black or brown skin) or white part of the eyes ( jaundice ) Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You might have been exposed to infected pee, water, or soil and have: a high temperature, or you feel hot and shivery a headache been feeling sick or being sick diarrhoea body aches and pains red eyes a loss of appetite Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you have: yellow skin (which may be harder to see on black or brown skin) and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) a rash been unable to pee swollen ankles, feet or hands chest pain shortness of breath You can call 111 or get help from NHS 111 online . Treatment from a GP Leptospirosis can often be treated by your GP. You'll usually be given antibiotic tablets to treat the infection. Most people recover in a few days or weeks. It's important to finish the course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve any aches, pains or a high temperature. If you have severe symptoms, you may need to be treated in hospital. How to avoid getting leptospirosis Leptospirosis is rare in the UK. You have a higher chance of getting it if you do outdoor activities like water sports (especially while abroad in tropical areas), or you work with animals or animal parts. There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting leptospirosis. Do wash your hands with soap and water after handling animals or animal products clean any wounds as soon as possible cover any cuts and grazes with waterproof plasters wear protective clothing if you're at risk through your job shower as soon as possible if you've been in potentially infected water check your dog is vaccinated against leptospirosis (there is no vaccine for people) Don’t do not touch water or soil that may contain animal pee do not touch dead animals with your bare hands do not drink water from places like rivers, canals or lakes – always boil or treat it first Page last reviewed: 28 June 2023 Next review due: 28 June 2026"

Do keep the affected finger clean and covered with a dressing take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen , to ease the pain try to discourage children with a whitlow from sucking their thumb Don’t do not touch the infected finger do not touch other people with your infected finger to avoid spreading the infection do not try to drain the fluid by squeezing the affected area do not touch other areas of your body with the infected finger, particularly your eyes – if you wear contact lenses, use the hand that's not affected to put them in and take them out, or wear glasses until the infection has healed Causes of herpetic whitlow Herpetic whitlow is caused by a virus called herpes simplex. You can get it if you touch a cold sore or blister of another infected person. You're more likely to get herpetic whitlow if you've had cold sores or genital herpes. You may also get it if you have a weakened immune system – for example, if you have diabetes or you're having chemotherapy. The first time you have herpetic whitlow will usually be the most severe. Herpetic whitlow can come back Once you have the herpes virus, it stays in your body for the rest of your life, so if you get herpetic whitlow once you can get it again. For example, it might come back if you have a cut or sore on your finger, or if you're feeling stressed or unwell. There's not much you can do to prevent herpetic whitlow but it can be treated in the same way if it comes back.

    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/whooping-cough/",
    "text": "Whooping cough Whooping cough (pertussis) is an infection of the lungs and breathing tubes. It spreads very easily and can be serious. It's important for babies, children and anyone who's pregnant to get vaccinated against it. Symptoms of whooping cough The first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold , such as a runny nose and sore throat (a high temperature is uncommon). After about a week, you or your child: will get coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night may make a \"whoop\" sound – a gasp for breath between coughs (young babies and some adults may not \"whoop\") may have difficulty breathing after a coughing bout and may turn blue or grey (young infants) may bring up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit may become very red in the face (more common in adults) The cough may last for several weeks or months. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your baby is under 6 months old and has symptoms of whooping cough you or your child have a very bad cough that is getting worse you've been in contact with someone with whooping cough and you're pregnant Check symptoms on 111 online (for children aged 5 and over) or call 111 (for children under 5). Whooping cough can be dangerous Babies under 12 months old with whooping cough have an increased chance of having problems such as: dehydration breathing difficulties pneumonia seizures (fits) Whooping cough is less severe in older children and adults but coughing may cause problems including: sore ribs hernia middle ear infections pee leaking out when you cough ( urinary incontinence ) Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: your or your child's lips, tongue, face or skin suddenly turn blue or grey (on black or brown skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet) you or your child are finding it hard to breathe properly (shallow breathing) you or your child have chest pain that's worse when breathing or coughing – this could be a sign of pneumonia your child is having seizures (fits) Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatment for whooping cough Treatment for whooping cough depends on your age and how long you've had the infection. Hospital treatment is usually needed if you have severe whooping cough, or your baby is under 6 months old and has whooping cough. If whooping cough is diagnosed within 2 weeks of your cough starting, you'll be given antibiotics to help stop it spreading to others. Some healthcare and nursery workers may be given antibiotics within 3 weeks of the cough starting. Antibiotics may not reduce symptoms. Important Keep taking the antibiotics until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. Stopping treatment too soon could lead to the infection coming back. How to ease the symptoms of whooping cough There are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms of whooping cough. Do get plenty of rest drink lots of fluids take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you or your child are uncomfortable – check the leaflet if you're not sure it's suitable for you or your child Don’t do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16 years How long whooping cough is contagious If you have whooping cough, you're contagious for up to 3 weeks after the coughing starts. If you start antibiotics within 2 weeks of starting to cough, it will reduce the time you're contagious for. Important Stay off school, work or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 2 weeks after your cough started if you've not had antibiotics. If you're a healthcare or nursery worker and work with young babies or pregnant women, stay off work for 3 weeks after your cough started if you've not had antibiotics. The whooping cough vaccine The whooping cough vaccine protects babies and children from getting whooping cough. That's why it's important to have all the routine NHS vaccinations . The whooping cough vaccine is routinely given as part of the: 6-in-1 vaccine – for babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks 4-in-1 pre-school booster – for children aged 3 years 4 months If you're pregnant you should also have the whooping cough vaccine. You usually have it when you're around 20 weeks pregnant. This helps protect your baby for the first few weeks of their life. Speak to your GP surgery or midwife if you're 20 weeks pregnant and have not been offered the whooping cough vaccine.

    "title": "Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome",
    "url": "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/",
    "text": "Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a condition that causes the heart to beat abnormally fast for periods of time. The cause is an extra electrical connection in the heart. This problem with the heart is present at birth (congenital), although symptoms may not develop until later in life. Many cases are diagnosed in otherwise healthy young adults. Sometimes the extra electrical connection won't cause any symptoms and may only be picked up when an electrocardiogram (ECG) test is carried out for another reason. In these cases, further tests will be done to determine if treatment is required. Is it serious? It can be scary to be told that you have a problem with your heart, but WPW syndrome usually isn't serious. Many people will have no symptoms or only experience occasional, mild episodes of their heart racing. With treatment, the condition can normally be completely cured. For some people, their condition settles down without needing treatment. WPW syndrome can sometimes be life-threatening, particularly if it occurs alongside a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation . But this is rare and treatment can eliminate this risk. Symptoms of WPW syndrome If you have WPW syndrome, you may experience episodes where your heart suddenly starts racing, before stopping or slowing down abruptly. This rapid heart rate is called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) . During an episode, you may experience symptoms such as: a pounding or fluttering heartbeat ( heart palpitations ) feeling lightheaded or dizzy shortness of breath chest pain passing out ( fainting ) These episodes can last for seconds, minutes or hours. How often they occur varies from person to person. Some people may have episodes on a daily basis, while others may only experience them a few times a year. They normally occur randomly, without any identifiable cause, but they can sometimes be triggered by strenuous exercise or drinking a lot of alcohol or caffeine. When to seek medical advice See a GP if you keep getting a fast or noticeable heartbeat ( palpitations ). It's important to get it checked out in case it could be something serious. Dial 999 for an ambulance if: your heartbeat doesn't go back to normal in a few minutes you have chest pain that lasts more than 15 minutes – you may also have pain in your arms, back or jaw you have chest pain and other symptoms like feeling sick, being sick (vomiting), shortness of breath or sweating someone passes out (faints) and doesn't regain consciousness If you've been diagnosed with WPW syndrome and you experience an episode, first try the techniques you've been taught or take any medication you've been given. Dial 999 or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if these measures don't stop the episode within a few minutes, or if someone you know has WPW syndrome and collapses or faints. What causes WPW syndrome? When the heart beats, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, allowing the heart to fill with blood again. This is controlled by electrical signals. In WPW syndrome, there's an extra electrical connection in the heart, which allows electrical signals to bypass the usual route and form a short circuit. This means the signals travel round and round in a loop, causing episodes where the heart beats very fast. The extra electrical connection is caused by a strand of heart muscle that grows while the unborn baby is developing in the womb. It's not clear exactly why this happens. It just seems to occur randomly in some babies, although rare cases have been found to run in families. Diagnosing WPW syndrome If your doctor thinks you might have WPW syndrome after assessing your symptoms, they'll probably recommend having an electrocardiogram (ECG) and will refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist). An ECG is a test that records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. Small discs called electrodes are stuck onto your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to an ECG machine. The machine records the tiny electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. If you have WPW syndrome, the ECG will record an unusual pattern that isn't usually present in people who don't have the condition. To confirm the diagnosis, you may be asked to wear a small portable ECG recorder so your heart rhythm can be recorded during an episode. The recorder will trace your heart rate continuously over a few days, or when you switch it on at the start of an episode. Treatments for WPW syndrome In many cases, episodes of abnormal heart activity associated with WPW syndrome are harmless, don't last long, and settle down on their own without treatment. You may therefore not need any treatment if your symptoms are mild or occur very occasionally, although you should still have regular check-ups so your heart can be monitored. If your cardiologist recommends treatment, there are a number of options available. You can have treatment to either stop episodes when they occur, or prevent them occurring in the future. Stopping an episode There are 3 main techniques and treatments that can help stop episodes as they occur. These are: Vagal manoeuvres – techniques designed to stimulate the nerve that slows down the electrical signals in your heart. An example is the \"Valsalva manoeuvre\", where you hold your nose, close your mouth and exhale hard while straining as if you're on the toilet. Medication – an injection of medicine such as adenosine can be given in hospital if vagal manoeuvres don't help. It can block the abnormal electrical signals in your heart. Cardioversion – a type of electric shock therapy that jolts the heart back into a normal rhythm. This may be carried out in hospital if the above treatments don't work. Preventing further episodes Techniques and treatments that can help prevent episodes include: Lifestyle changes – if your episodes are triggered by things such as strenuous exercise or alcohol, avoiding these may help. Your cardiologist can advise you about this. Catheter ablation – this procedure is commonly used nowadays to destroy the extra part of the heart causing the problems in the heart's electrical system. It's effective in around 95% of cases. Medication – daily tablets of medication such as amiodarone can help prevent episodes by slowing down the electrical impulses in your heart.
